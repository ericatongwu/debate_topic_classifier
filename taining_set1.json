  	"data": "I want thank you all for coming out. This is a very important question at this very difficult time in our nation's political history. Every day we are reminded that in many ways our country is on the edge of a knife. And we can slide either way. I think all of us recognize the great harm that Trump is doing in this country, the type of hateful rhetoric he's injecting into our country and the way he is changing the mindset of So, many people in this country toward a more divisive and destructive mentality. And it is our job  but I  you'll hear some allusions from me later, like comments about the 1930s in America. But in many ways, we are confronting something that our allies confronted in western Europe in 1930s in Europe. And they failed in their attempts to strike down sort of ultranationalism and xenophobia and racism, and we cannot afford to fail. There's no one to come. There's no greater  greatest generation somewhere else to come here and protect us. What does that mean? That means we have got to galvanize the American people, the grassroots of the American people. We've got to unify the American people and create a country that, as Bernie says, that in a government and an economy that works for everyone. And I think as we go through this tonight and we talk a little bit about the history of the Democratic party and where we are today, I think you will see that not only is the sort of neoliberal corporatist view incapable of confronting and defeating Trump, but in many ways, it is responsible for its rise in this country. Our great party, the Democratic Party, the modern Democratic Party, was born in the crucible of the New Deal. FDR came into power at a time of great economic calamity, as all of you know. It was a worldwide depression. And against great opposition from Republicans, from business interests, and frankly, from many inside the Democratic Party, put together a coalition  created Social Security, created workers' rights, created a lot of investments in this country that we still see today  the TVA and other things  that created dominance by democratic politics in this country for decades, this coalition, this grand New Deal coalition. And our job in this country is to rebuild that grand New Deal coalition. This cannot be a party of only upper middle income people, of only welltodo suburbanites. This has got to be a party that represents also workingclass people and marginalized communities. And what those people understand is that we have big problems in this country and we need bold solutions. And the solutions that are being offered by people in the sort of progressive, populist camp are not unrealistic or undoable if we have the political will in this country. We live in the richest country in the history of the world. All of our western democratic allies have universal healthcare. We do not. We used to have free tuition at public colleges and universities in this country. That's not a new thing. That's kind of an old thing. We used to have that. And we have lost it. The value of the minimum wage has degraded over time. The working people need to have a decent standard of living in this country, whether that's through legislation or putting pressure on companies, as we've seen recently  Senator Sanders got a third of a million people a raise at Amazon.com. So, we have got to energize and excite people. And what has happened is, after this period of dominance, we had the Reagan Revolution. Although we did not lose the House during that time period; we should remember that. We had the Reagan Revolution. And then a group of folks came along and said, The problem with the Democratic Party is we're not really enough in the pocket of Wall Street and financial interests. And if we do that, we can really win. And they did win. In 1992, Bill Clinton won with 43 percent vote. It was a threeway race, as people may remember. And [unintelligible] going down a path of neoliberal economics. We had NAFTA. We had Most Favored Nation status with China. And we destroyed the relationship between the Democratic Party and its historic workingclass base in this country. In 1994, we lost the House of Representatives for the first time since 1952. Seeing that kind of loss and the disconnection between workingclass people in and the party, they turned to a very ugly set of policies. DOMA, who attacked the LGBT community. Welfare reform, which was a pareddown version of Reagan's welfare queen program. The crime bill, which created mass incarceration in this country. We forget that Bill Clinton and Joe Biden are the fathers of mass incarceration in America. And since then, we have been trying to find our way. And in 2016, the grassroots of this party said, No more. We want to stand up. We want to reclaim our New Deal heritage. We want to be the dominant party in this country again for decades to come. We want to bring people together and not divide them up. We have got to serve the interests of working people, marginalized communities, and not the rich and the powerful. And I hope you vote for us at the end of this process."

  	"data": "The question before us is this. If Democrats run on the ideas of the progressive populists, will that save the Democratic Party? Will these ideas win elections everywhere So, that we can defeat Trump in 2020? The answer is no. Let's start with what we  all of us on this stage  have in common. We are all excited about the new generation of candidates hailing from all ideological wings. Young people, women, and people of color are adding dynamism and diversity to the Democratic Party. But where we disagree is over the ideas these candidates should be carrying. The evidence is overwhelming that populist ideas will not help Democrats regain the White House or majorities. They might look good on a bumper sticker. But when voters hear about the details, support crumbles. Take their centerpiece idea: Medicare for All. It has been tested and it has failed. In 2016, the purple state of Colorado had a Medicare for all style initiative on the ballot. It was decimated. Seventynine percent voted no. It lost in liberal Boulder. In deep blue Vermont the state passed singlepayer in 2011 and gave up on it just three years later because the costs and tax increases were simply too high. Now, I admit that during these midterm general elections there have been lots of Medicare for all ads on the air, but here's the rub. They're not being aired by Democrats. They're being aired by Republicans as attack ads on Democrats. The GOP knows that if they can label every Democrat as a backer of Medicare for all, as well as other far left ideas like abolishing ICE, they can retain the House. So, yes, their signature ideas are politically potent for Republicans. Progressive populist ideas are not going to elect Democrats and save us from Trump and democratic voters agree. Bernie Sanders and his allies proclaimed that this would be their year and to prove it they backed a lot of democratic primary candidates carrying his agenda. Well, the primaries are over and how did they do? Twentythree million people just voted in the democratic primaries. They were our most energized and committed voters turning out in historic numbers to put a check on Trump and they represented a bit tent democratic party, young and old, urban, suburban, and rural, white, black, Hispanic, and Asian. And most of them voted for the more mainstream Democrat and against the democratic socialist. Yes, there were notable exceptions. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez [spelled phonetically] and Rashida Talib [spelled phonetically] won by running inspired races in cobalt blue districts, but mainstream democrats won almost everywhere else. In the house nonincumbent candidates aligned with the moderate new Democrats won 32 of their 37 primaries, a stunning 86 percent win rate. Meanwhile, our revolution, the group formed by supporters of Bernie Sanders had a dismal 39 percent win rate. So, if running on a Sanders style platform is the way for Democrats to regain power someone had better tell the 23 million democratic primary voters who felt otherwise. And if candidates carrying these ideas can't win primaries, that agenda clearly has no chance of delivering victories in a general election. In June of 2017 Bernie Sanders published an op ed titled, How Democrats Can Stop Losing Elections. In it he proclaimed that his ideas were the key to victory, but on the very day it was published democratic primary voters in Virginia had to choose between Ralph Northam [spelled phonetically] and Tom Periello [spelled phonetically] as their gubernatorial nominee. Periello, a talented former congressman, proudly embraced a populist agenda and even featured Bernie in his ads. Northam ran as a proud moderate. So, it was a great field experiment for tonight's debate motion. If progressive populist ideas are the way to win, then especially in a democratic primary it must be that the populist Periello won handily. The reality? Northam crushed him by 12 points and went on to easily win the general election. That Virginia win by a moderate kicked off the primary season. Andrew Cuomo's resounding victory over Cynthia Nixon marked the last. With a handful of exceptions primaries in the 48 states in between delivered similar results. Democrats chose moderate nominees who fit their districts in states and were best positioned to win in a general election. So, remember, if you vote for this motion, you're not saying the democratic socialist ideas and the candidates carrying them can win in Queens. You're saying that these populist ideas can win and save the democratic party everywhere. Twentythree million democratic primary voters just weighed in on this question. And if they were here tonight, most of them would once again vote no on this proposition. I hope you'll do the same."

  	"data": "So, let's step back for a second and actually define what we're here to debate. First, populism. Populism is defined in the dictionary as support for the concerns of ordinary people. But I would say everybody here on stage probably agrees with that. Now let's go down a little deeper and really get into the discussion. Populism is not about right versus left, but it's about top versus bottom. Populism actually offers up solutions. How? Well, one of the solutions that's it offers up is how do we fight against a society that benefits the privileged, the elites? Now, there are many forms of populism. Donald Trump has his form of populism rhetoric, but his populism is right wing, white nationalist populism. He chooses to divide the country using race, religion, immigration status, and gender. Progressive populism unifies and brings us all together. The late Senator Paul Wellstone used to say, When we all do better  we all do better when we all do better. Now, economics is key. It's the key tenet of progressive populism, but it's not the only thing. We also have to talk about the systems, the power of systems that are created to help to benefit the privileged and the elites. And I'm talking about white supremacy. I'm talking about patriarchy, Islamophobia and also heterosexism, which is what  which  what progressive populism does, it fights against that. It says, No, to that. So, we also need  we need inclusive populism and also multiracial populism. Now, many of our opponents would say what we're talking about is identity politics. And identity politics divides people. But then I would say, how are we supposed to get justice if we don't know the reality of our identities? How do we not define who's at the top and who's at the bottom? How do we move forward? As I mentioned earlier in my opening, my parents were immigrants. My dad was a New York City cab driver, my mom, a home health care aide. And I would argue, and I think I would be right to say, that what they  the issues that they  that matter to them also matter to their white workingclass counterparts. But, look, I'm not here to define, really. That's not the role that I'm supposed to do. But I wanted to give you a sense of populism and progressive populism, what that means. I'm supposed to give you an argument as to why progressive populism is the future of the Democratic party. Jeff did a good job giving the history of populism. I'm going to give you some data points. Progressive populism, as I mentioned, has solutions. Our solutions are actually incredibly popular. For example, Medicare for all. Blake Research did a survey back in April and asked voters in  in the  in battleground congressional districts how they felt about Medicare for all. Fiftyfour percent strongly support Medicare for all. But I think the most interesting thing about that survey was that Democrat who are infrequent voters, it was more popular with them. So, progressive politics favors debtfree college, which is popular. It favors universal childcare, which is popular. Affordable homeownership, which is important. And we also believe in the auto bailout, which was incredibly successful, thank you, Steve Rattner. And it was a great example of how activism  how government, when they step into activism can really help the markets and intervene in the markets. That's what it did. But now I want to talk about the successful candidates who are progressive populists that are currently happening right now, and not in blue states. I'm talking about deep red states. The first one is Beta O'Roark. He's running in Texas. Donald Trump won Texas by nine points. Mitt Romney won Texas 16 points. Beta O'Roark is authentic. He's fighting for the people. He's progressive. He's not taking PAC money, he's not taking corporation money, and he's doing really well in that race. Wendy Davis, who lost that  who lost the governor's race a couple years ago by 20 points, said that she would won  would run a more progressive campaign, a more authentic campaign if she were to do it again. Andrew Gillam, incredibly progressive, making history. And in the naysayers, in the primary had said, Oh, he's too progressive. He's too liberal. There's no way. He came out in the general election, has been leading in all of the polls in Florida. Trump won that by one or two points. All the past Democratic candidates who were  who were in the middle have never done as well as he's doing right now. And the irony of that is he's probably going to, on his coattails, help Bill Nelson win, who is a centrist. Look, it's not going to be up to us who are on stage that's going to decide what the  what the Democratic party is going to do. It's going to be up to activists and voters out in the country, across the country. And they're making it loud and clear. They want the Democratic party to be  to challenge, I should say, status quo, and to fight for the 99 percent, not the 1 percent. So, progressive populism is the future of the Democratic party. Thank you."

  	"data": "Thanks. Let me start by echoing what John said. I am a Democrat, and I consider myself a progressive, and I consider myself as a fighter for the 99 percent as I think it should be defined. I believe that our tax system excessively favors the rich. I believe that income inequality in our country is at reprehensible levels and must be addressed. I believe that the federal government should lean in and try to solve the pressing problems of those who have been left behind. I believe that America has an important role to play in the world, including by imparting our values of democracy and human rights. But I don't believe that endorsing policy ideas that are either unaffordable or make little economic sense or will do more harm than good, or all three, would somehow be good politics for the Democratic party. Let me do my historical review. There has not been a single Democratic presidentelected in our history espousing the kinds of policies that the proponents of this motion advocate, not FDR, Jeff, who ran in 1932 on a platform of balancing the budget; not John F. Kennedy, who, by the way, cut taxes for the rich; not Jimmy Carter, who ran as a selfstyled New Democrat; certainly not Bill Clinton, and not even Barack Obama who Senator Sanders attacked as weak for not pushing more robust, i.e., progressive policies. Then there are the losers. George McGovern, who carried just one state and the District of Columbia in 1972. In 1984, Walter Mondale suffered exactly the same fate. Just four years after that, Michael Dukakis was trounced, 426 electoral votes to 111. All of us up here agree that the election of Donald Trump was one of the saddest days of our lifetime. And with an approval rating hovering around 43 percent, there's no way he should be re elected. But if we want to make the unimaginable imaginable, just nominate someone out of touch with the mainstream of this country. We can talk about all we want about energizing the base. But remember that only 33 percent of Americans are even Democrats at all. It's also worth noting that the share of Independents at 37 percent is the highest in 27 years. Last I looked, you needed around 50 percent to win. You've heard the suggestion that Bernie Sanders could have beaten Donald Trump. We'll never know. But we do know a few things. For starters, it has historically always been very difficult and rare for someone of the same party as a twoterm incumbent to win the presidency. After  after eight years, voters generally want to change, as they did in 2008 and again in 2016. We won't have that impediment in 2020, but we will have a more important problem that hurt Mrs. Clinton, the fact that Democratic voters are increasingly concentrated geographically, particularly in big blue states like New York and California. That's a large part of why Mrs. Clinton lost, even though she got 3 million more votes than Donald Trump. So, to win, we must reach out to more moderate voters in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, and in Wisconsin, three states that we never should have lost. Lastly, you've heard turnout blamed for Secretary Clinton's loss, but at 60.1 percent, turnout was higher in 2016 than it was for Barack Obama's reelection in 2012. Now, let's turn to policy. John made a compelling case for why Medicare for All is bad politics. The same would inevitably be true of some of the other ideas that Senator Sanders and his sympathizershaveputforthoncetheelectorateunderstoodtheimplications. Guaranteea$15 an hour income to all. That would cost in the order of $680 million annually. How about providing a $12,000ayear basic income to every American? The bill for that, a whopping $3.8 trillion per year. And given that our tax revenue runs about 3.5 trillion annually, paying for that would require doubling taxes. Expand Social Security? That sounds pretty good, until Americans understand that the trust fund is on track to go broke in 2034 and jeopardize the benefits that we've already promised. Just wait until the voters go to Sanders's website, as I did, and find him absurdly claiming that Social Security has a $2.8 trillion surplus. Make public colleges and universities' tuition free, as Jeff suggested. It's a great goal for the underprivileged. But if any of my kids were to go to a public institution, I have no idea why they should get a free ride. Break up the big banks? That sounds appealing, although apparently not to Mr. Sanders's Senate colleagues, none of whom have signed on as cosponsors of his bill. Abolish ICE? Only 32 percent of voters of that, while 53 percent understand that Immigration and Customs Service, albeit with reforms, is something that we need to have. Even among Democrats, only 44 percent want to abolish ICE. As I close, I want to reemphasize the extent to which I share the goals of the populists. I share everything that has been said before me as a goal. But we should address the critical issues facing our nation by putting forward responsible, prudent policies that will attract the coalition of voters that we need to keep Donald Trump from another four years of destroying America. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you, John. When we talk about saving health care, what we're effectively talking about is achieving the AAA, reducing unsustainable cost, increasing access to care, and improving clinical outcomes. My partner and I believe that retail alliances, which are the convergence of health care with retail, technology, and consumer product companies, and not government are capable of changing the system. It's saving health care. We all have a lot of pain in the system. We've all experienced that. I won't take you through it all. But we have the fragmentation of care. We have inform silos. We have difficulty getting  getting access to care and getting appointments. And then the bills come in, too, and they keep coming in. And you can't figure them out, too. But that's because we have costs that are out of control. With respect to the costs, you know the statistics. $3.3 trillion in health care expenditures in 2016. Eighteen percent of our GDP, $10,348 per person. That's not per family or per county. That's per person that we spend on health care. It is out of control. And the sad thing is  is that outcomes rank last against comparable countries in similar developed nations with similar economics as ours, too. We are last, last, last. Had the highest mortality rate amenable to health care. We have the highest error rates. We have the longest wait times with the exception of Canada and then we also have twice as many avoidable emergency room visits as any other country. One of the things that John mentioned is the rise of consumerism and we think that this is a really important facet here. So, we have been trained. We have been trained by our online experience, what we want out of consumer interaction and we want that experience in health care, too. So, what customers are looking for, they're looking for choice. They're looking for choice in care. They're looking for quality. They're looking for costs. And we don't have that now. We don't have that transparency, too. So, the government isn't very good with consumers. When's the last time you went to your DMV to try to get a license? If you want to see the consumer experience there. So, we need new delivery models. The old ones aren't working. And our position is  is that consumer centric retail alliances will help drive access and convenience, enhance the customer experience, and actually kick up innovation as well. You heard about some of this earlier, too, on the stage at the beginning of the  at the beginning of the session here, so retail health models, they're a key step to costeffective care any time, anywhere. Retailers have scale. They have the ability to make these changes. They can also activate through multiple channels the engagement that they have with their customers. It's through their stores, through their clinics, through their doctors, through their nurses, through their websites, through their apps, through the email, through the texts, and even old mail, too. We still get those flyers in the mail I'm trying to get rid of. The other thing is innovation. With innovation tech and consumer product companies are creating amazing devices, wearables, implantables, digestables, things that can measure many of the vital signs that can give early indications of care conditions or diseases. Same thing with apps. We have 200,000 apps out there. You have apps now that can diagnose your disease by coughing into them or they can tell by your gait when you walk down  walking on your carpet whether your gait is impaired and what that may lead to. It also can measure your care adherence. It also can tell if you've fallen down and it can help you get the appropriate help, too. So, I'm not saying that government doesn't have a role here. Government has a very, very important role, but it's to support retail. It's to support innovation. It's not to drive the cart, it's to help push it, too. They need to get behind promising initiatives. They need to also align incentives and then most importantly they need to put the infrastructure in place to gather evidence to implement appropriate regulation, because what we need in our transforming business right now is we need regulation at the speed of innovation, not innovation at the speed of regulation. So, in closing, I would say that the retail alliance advantages are many. They have the appetite and the will. They have the appetite and the will. Does government have the will to change the system to make the changes necessary here? They aren't encumbered by the legacy costs and the legacy inefficiencies, the inertia that's caused by all those people that profit off the inefficiencies. They also have previous experience in adoption and use of technology. This is really important for this business that is a lagger [phonetic] from an industry perspective, too. And then the customer centricity and engagement, which can actually nudge people into healthy behaviors, into healthy choices as well, too. So, lastly, they are agnostic to politics. It's not going to change every four years. It's not going to change every two years. These are ongoing longterm investments to really make a difference in the health care system, too. So, it's time for a new approach to health care and I hope that you will support our proposition that retail, not Washington, will help save healthcare. Thank you."

    "data": "I want to start with a little selfhelp moment. Hello, my name is Lisa. I'm a doctor, and I take my kids to the CVS Minute Clinic. It happened two weeks ago. You know how it is. Your kids start school. I have an elementary school student  a 10yearold in fifth grade. She comes home one weekend, Friday evening: sore throat, fever to 102. You guys tell me; what does she have? Strep throat. Absolutely. It's Friday evening. She needs antibiotics. I don't prescribe anymore. So, of course the doctor's office is closed. So, what do we do at 8:00 p.m.? We go down to CVS. We put our name on the list. We mill around, looking at magazines and hairbrushes for the better part of an hour. We get seen by the nurse practitioner. We are out in an hourand ahalf, antibiotic in hand. She's back in school on Monday. Seems like it was fantastic, right? Now, while I was sitting there, I was remembering that I am going to be coming to you and defending the negative  that retailers aren't going to be the ones to transform healthcare. So, I started thinking, you know what? There was something with this visit. It hit a very important note, but was it going to the doctor? Is it going to replace my daughter's pediatrician? Absolutely not. You know what it felt like? It felt like we were meeting with the nurse across a card table in a broom closet in the back of CVS. So, serve to point. But is it truly transformative? And I'll be the first one to admit that I am not up here to convince you that Washington and the government is going to be the main change agent. But I want to give you some thoughts about what retailers would have to do if they're going to truly transform healthcare. I think there's two things that are really important. Simply: are they in it to really change the system? What's their motive for getting into healthcare? And then, second, are they going to tackle the really big problems and the big cost drivers that are the reason that we are 30 percent more expensive than the next highest spending Western country? And more importantly, will patients like you trust retailers to help them make those big healthcare decisions? So, I've been really blessed in my time working in healthcare to get to work with a lot of providers, doctors, hospitals, health systems  including Mayo Clinic  as well as several of the major retailers. And I've gotten an inside window into their strategy in healthcare. Take CVS. These guys have been at it for a long time. Did you know the first Minute Clinic opened here in Minnesota 20 years ago? They are still doing the Minute Clinic thing. Haven't really expanded much past it. You talk to them and you say, Well, why haven't you been able to grow this as quickly? Well, we were [unintelligible] testing out different business models. We're not sure where we want to go with it. And we have found real obstacles to growth right inside the store. You know who their biggest obstacle is? The store manager. That guy is bonused on revenue per square foot  how much dog food and shampoo you buy when you are in CVS. He doesn't like a dozen people with the flu mingling around in the back of the store. Now take WalMart. I spent some time with them in Bentonville [spelled phonetically], Arkansas. WalMart will tell you  why are they interested in healthcare? Yeah, there's a lot of money there. They think they can make money on it. But they're more concerned about you and how much your healthcare costs. They think we are spending so much money as individuals that it is hampering our shopping power. They think if they can lower healthcare costs, they could in fact increase their revenue by three to five percent. They want to get into healthcare so that you can buy more junk from WalMart. That's their value proposition. It goes back to the same retail game. Quick care leading to quick profits. Any of us who have been in healthcare know that change doesn't come quickly. It's frustrated venture capitalists. We're not like any other industry. They come in. They want to turn profits around quickly. It doesn't happen. Retailers are going to get frustrated. And if they're going to really make a dent in healthcare, it can't just be about primary care. That's seven percent of total healthcare spend. I think we all agree it should be more, but it is what it is. It can't even just be about pharmaceuticals. That's about 10 percent of health care spending. You have to tackle the big stuff: Hospital care, specialty care, the 10 percent of patients who account for 80 percent of costs who have really big, significant problems going on. And I started to think about that visit to the Minute Clinic. We all trust CVS or WalMart or Walgreen's or a virtual interaction with a retailer when we pretty know  much know what's going on. I knew my daughter had strep throat. You knew my daughter had strep throat with one sentence. But I would ask you, if they're really going to transform health care, are they interested in figuring out which hospital you should go to? Are you interested in having them tell you which hospital you should go to? So, to vote yes, you have to believe they're serious about that and that you would trust them to be your partner when it's your turn to walk through the hospital door. Thank you very much. And I hope you will consider our defensive position."

    "data": "Nobody knew health care could be so complicated, so explained President Trump last year. He continued. Let it be a failure. We'll blame it on the Democrats. Ladies and gentlemen, Washington is broken. And a broken Washington cannot save our health care system. The results speak for themselves. Washington responds more to the interests of pharmaceutical companies, big health insurers, and hospital systems than it does all of us who are accessing care. Hospital payments since 2000, up 60 percent. Pharmaceutical costs, up 69 percent. We see  I looked last night to look at the stock price of the major publicly traded health insurers, 300 percent of where they were just five years ago. Now, this isn't a red state issue or a blue state issue.It was a Democratic administration that took affordability out of the Affordable Care Act and gave a multiyear, multibilliondollar concession to big insurers so that they would support the bill. It was a Republican administration who gave up Medicare's ability to negotiate drug prices for seniors. The result, insulin, which cost $20 a few years ago for a senior, the same medication now costs that senior and his payer $700. Now, Washington is broken. Can we trust it to fix health care? There are two beacons of hope that I see; the first is the American employer and the alliances that employers are forming today. Keep in mind American employers are paying 88 percent of private health insurance costs. 88 percent. And when they pay for health care, they're paying at a rate of 189 percent of Medicare according to the Congressional Budget Office. So, employers have effectively become the piggy bank that is financing the runaway growth in health care spending in this country, paying for that proton beam machine the hospital didn't really need because there's a very suitable one right next door, paying for that fancy new wing. And this cost comes back into our Medicare costs and our Medicaid costs because now the federal government also has to keep these hospitals afloat who have built these institutions of exploitation to get more revenue from the private sector because they could. They were unchecked and unrestrained. Employers are beginning to take action. And I see this in what Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan are doing. And when Warren Buffett says that he and his fellow CEOs are attacking the hungry tapeworm that is eating at the American economy, they mean it. And every CEO in America has woken up and begun to pay attention to their health care costs, recognizing that we can move from a system of health care that is sponsored by employers, to one that is driven by them, that goals toward the outcomes, that focuses on improving the health and wellness of our people and the bottom lines of our economy. Right here in Minnesota, we saw, for the first time, that retail clinics produced costs that were 40 to 80 percent cheaper than urgent care as their primary care as in a study, and with no worse quality. We've seen the same thing happen everywhere insurance ends and retail begins, areas that aren't covered by traditional insurance. Look at the cost of Lasik eye surgery, down 30 percent over the last 10 years. Nothing else in health care decreases in costs. Look at the cost of in vitro fertilization. As technologies improve, the costs have come down. We always see the inverse in health care. Even specialty surgeries. Look at the Surgery Center of Oklahoma where you can get on Google, and you get a price list for a knee replacement, and it's 20 percent of the cost of the competing institution. We see this across the board. The question tonight is about who will have the incentives to reshape pharmaceutical distribution and care delivery and move us out of a world of secret negotiations where the winner negotiates the best deal into a world where we are rewarding the best service. And normally, this would be an important question, but it's particularly acute in today's political climate. Over the last two years, Washington has moved to defund the Children's Health Insurance program, defund Planned Parenthood. Today, the House passed a bill that seeks to remove $1.5 trillion from Medicaid and 500 trillion  $500 billion from Medicare. A court system that is set on taking away a woman's right to choose. Ladies and gentlemen, Washington is coordinating an assault on the health of women, children, the elderly and the poor. We have an American economy and a set of incentives in retail and employer enterprises that are looking to take it back. Will Washington save our system? Please join me in voting for the motion to prove that America can save the health care system."

    "data": "So, the United States has some of the most innovative, lifesaving treatments in the country  in the world. But, for the 28 million uninsured Americans, those treatments are completely out of reach. And for the 82 million Americans who have health insurance but can barely afford what they've got, they are deferring care and actually not getting the care they need, which actually puts their lives at risk. So, who are these people that are being left out of our health care system? It's actually the American workers who are fueling our economy. It's the delivery drivers who bring Amazon's packages to your door, and other people in the gig economy, which happens to be one of the biggest growing segments in our economy. For those people, they don't have health insurance, and their only option for health care is to either cross their fingers or show up in the ER. So, in this lack of access to health care, we lag way behind comparable countries. We lag behind in other measures. You've heard the other debaters talk about this cost in quality. In fact, we actually spend twice as much in this country, and we get half the results. So, these measures, cost, quality, and access, those are really the measures of how an entire health care system is performing. And we could be doing much better in these measures. In fact, we're failing in many of them. We do need to save the U.S. health care system. And the question on the table is, will retail alliances save us? I'm here with Lisa, my partner, to argue that, no, in fact, they will not. The bottom line is that if you want to address cost, quality, and access for all, then retail is not enough. Let's start with cost. We spend 18 percent of our GDP on health care. Other countries spend 10 percent. If we want to reduce our health care spending, retail is not enough. As Lisa mentioned, if you go to CVS they can provide you with some convenience and that's great, but that's not actually addressing the major cost drivers in our system. If we look at quality measures, things like hospital admissions from preventable disease or life expectancy, we lag behind other countries. It's frankly kind of embarrassing. To improve those quality measures, we really need to invest outside of health care into the social determinants of health. If we want to bring in terms of access our hundred million American workers, including those Amazon drivers, into the system, retail is not going to solve that. And why isn't retail enough? The first is that  the first reason is that retail alliances are for profit. There are really three main reasons, for profit, they leave people out, and they don't have the scale. So, in terms of forprofit business, a retailer's bottom line is really not society's bottom line. They are not oriented towards doing the common good. They need paying customers. They take a shortterm view. They have to. Their priority is their shareholders, not what's good for society. So, if you're a lowincome Medicaid customer and you have a lot of different complex needs or you're an Amazon driver in between gigs, retailers don't really see you as a moneymaking opportunity. And that's not to say there aren't a lot of forprofit companies doing great things, but again, their priorities are their shareholders. If we turn to employers, let's look at what they're doing. They actually leave out most of the population. They insure less than half of our population. That's 151 million people, which is a lot, but the scale of the employers who can actually drive change is very small. It's less than half of that and when you look at the alliances like Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, J.P. Morgan, they only cover a tiny fraction than a million people. So, providers are not going to make changes if they don't feel like they've got the people coming in the door who are really going to be able to affect that change and I submit that employers don't have that scale. In fact, it's government that has that scale. Government is playing an increasingly large role in the role of payer, both for Medicare and Medicaid and if we look at that silver tsunami that's coming at us, that's only going to grow. So, ultimately retailer's and employer's scope is limited. Retail alliances are not enough. Washington actually has to be part of the solution and I would submit that Washington is us. Our health care system is vast and complex, but it does require systemic solutions. Washington won't solve all of our problems. I run a forprofit health care consulting firm, I admit, and I know that Washington and government can hinder private enterprise. But I've also seen firsthand how government can work. When I helped start up the Health Connector in Massachusetts, we served as a real catalyst for change and we found a way to collaborate. We found a way to bring industry and the government together to build a model that ensured hundreds of thousands of people. We were a convener. We leveled the playing field and we ensured equity through subsidies. So, when you look at the health care industry it is unique. It's actually full of market failures like monopolies, shortterm incentives, all kinds of things that the private sector won't solve on its own. We need Washington at the table. So, I'm excited about the debate. I'm a big fan of innovation. I think that that is part of the equation, but it's not going to address cost, quality, and access for all. For a health care system as vast and complex as ours, we have to have retail employers. They are necessary, but they're not sufficient. We need government at the table and we need to see that other developed nations have actually made that successful. They provide overwhelming proof that this can happen. We don't need scattershot solutions. We need a better functioning system. So, I urge you to vote no on the motion that retail alliances will save us."

    "data": "Good evening, everybody, and thanks so much to Intelligence Squared and the Aspen Ideas Festivalforinvitingmetoparticipatetonightinthisimportantconversation. I'mpleasedto argue in favor of the motion, Globalization Has Undermined America's Working Class. Over the last several decades, the U.S. government, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, embarked on a very particular form of global economic integration, embodied in the trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement, the World Trade Organization, and the TransPacific Partnership. These  the set of rules embodied in these agreements have undermined the bargaining power, the wages, and the democratic voice of America's workers. They've encouraged and rewarded outsourcing, overexports. They've shifted the balance of bargaining power toward wealthy and already powerful multinational corporations, and away from working people. This form of globalization has contributed substantially to the well documented growth in inequality and the stagnation of real wages for American workers. My partner Jared will talk about that in more detail. This is very much in contrast to the glowing promises made on behalf of these trade agreements by the proponents. And these policies have left American workers working harder for less, struggling to make a decent living, even in a wealthy and innovative country. I spent the last 25 years of my life in the trenches of the trade wars, representing American workers from the AFLCIO at USTR, and the State Department, and the Labor Department. I testified in front of Congress. And I experienced firsthand the inordinate power and influence of corporate lobbyists, even in otherwise friendly Democratic administrations. I was always outnumbered and always outspent by the massive voice of corporations, leaving workers less  workers' voice not as well represented. I am an economist by training, and I know that for all of you who have taken Econ 101, you learned that lesson really well, which is Free trade is good for everybody all the time. And yet, I think there is something a little bit dishonest and hypocritical about this argument. Having lived in those trenches, having been on the trade negotiation discussions, and having seen the influence of corporations. And what that's about is a couple of things. First of all, even in the neoclassical trade model, it's true that there is a real distributional impact of trade. This is predicted by the neoclassical trade model  that in a wealthy, skillintensive, capital intensive country like the United States, it is predicted that working class workers, those without a college degree, will actually have their wages undercut by trade liberalization and yet the reason that economists make such a powerful argument in favor of free trade is that they say well, it is possible to tax the winners and compensate the losers so that everybody comes out ahead. But do we do that? No, we don’t do it. We don't even think about doing it. Not only that, but we have doubled down in the other direction, but it's also true that the trade model is very narrow. The textbook trade model is one that assumes perfect competition, full employment, balanced trade, and it assumes away pesky problems like externalities like capital mobility, the arbitrage against labor and regulation. That happens when companies pit government and workers against each other across national borders and it assumes away the unfair trade practices by other countries. Well, let's break it down. How has globalization undermined the American working class? Well, the first thing really is about bargaining power. Think about bargaining power and if you think about trade agreements that make it easier and let more certain and more profitable for companies to move jobs overseas, they have gained their bargaining power relative to working people who aren't mobile. American workers can't outsource themselves. They need to make a living with a good American job on American soil whereas their boss can pit them against workers in China or Bangladesh or Mexico and threaten to move the job overseas if they ask too hard for a raise or health care or a pension or a bathroom break or safety goggles or a union. So, all those things, this is the lived reality for so many American workers. They understand the dynamics of power that globalization has exacerbated, the particular form of globalization. But let's be clear. Our choice is not whether to be in the global economy or not, whether to trade or not to trade, whether capital flows and immigration will happen, but rather what are the rules that we as a society choose to put in place to regulate these transnational flows and whom do these rules serve? We've made a series of wrong policy choices over the last 25 years negotiating and implementing flawed trade and investment deals that empowered and enriched multinational corporations leaving behind domestic producers, workers and communities. And globalization, technology, and domestic policy choices have worked together to undermine the bargaining, the wages, and the democratic voice of American workers with devastating results for American workers and the U.S. economy. We need to recognize we have mismanaged globalization in the past so that we can improve our policy choices in the future and therefore I ask you to vote yes on the proposition that Globalization has Undermined the American Working Class. Thank you very much."

    "data": "What's up? Thank you. Thank you so much for including me in this debate, inviting me here to Aspen and just the fabulous work Intelligence Squared does to put these together. The question that we're debating today is whether globalization has undermined the working class and I want to talk about what globalization has been. Since the end of World War II, global trade volumes has increased 40fold. That's in part because of some of the trade agreements that Thea talked about, but those trade agreements are only a part of the process of globalization. An even bigger part has been the invention of containers that you can put on ships and make it much cheaper to ship goods. The invention of the internet, which allows more coordination across borders, the widening of the Panama Canal and a whole bunch of other developments, as well as the fact that tariffs have come down 75 percent from what they were at the end of World War II and we've pursued a number of deals that make that trade easier. Taken together, that's the process of globalization and what James and I will be trying to convince you of tonight is that that process of globalization has left the working class in America on net better off. And that without it they would be considerably worse off, that if instead of everything I just described, we'd kept tariffs where they were in 1945, we hadn't widened the Panama Canal, but we narrowed it, we hadn't built out America's ports, but we put rocks in the harbors, and we had never invented the container  the working class would be much worse off today than they are  that globalization has, on net, been good. Not for everyone, not managed perfectly, many problems, many of them  most of them, in fact  I would agree with Jared and Thea on, and what we need to do to deal with them. But let's put some magnitudes on it. When I was in the White House, they told us, Never talk about the consumer benefits of trade because it sounds like you're willing to sacrifice jobs so that people can buy cheap underwear. The biggest problem we have in our economy, though, is wages. And if you can buy more with an hour's work, that means you got a pay increase. That means you got a raise. Right now, in America, there's 325 million people that buy imported products. On average, a recent study in a leading economics journal found they're 8 percent better off because of the imported goods that they buy. Now, we all know averages, but there's inequality. Not everyone benefits the same amount from trade. At the tenth percentile, your benefits is 67 percent. At the median, it's about 35 percent. Why so much larger? Because you're spending a lot more money on things like clothing that are imported rather than attending debates in Aspen, which don't  aren't imported. So, there's been, on the consumption side, something that I would not sneer at, demean, or rush past, but enormously important to the purchasing power of 325 million Americans. Now, let's talk about what it means for workers. There's 14 million Americans that work in export industries. On average, they get paid 18 percent more than other workers, controlling for their characteristics. We did research that, just based on the increase in the export share over the last two decades, the typical workingclass worker is getting an extra $1,300 from that opportunity to work in industries that are higherpaid better jobs in general than the ones that we are losing. That's just exports. Of course, globalization is more than that. There's massive capital flows, and $4 trillion has been invested from abroad in the United States, creating jobs for Americans in industries that do disproportionate amounts of investment, disproportionate amounts of R&D, and pay disproportionately higher wages. Those two sides  the consumer side, which affects every single American, and the producer side, which affects those who are working for it  have enormous benefits. There's nothing in economics that says that trade benefits everyone. Absolutely it has winners and losers. It may even make a minor contribution to inequality  something we can come back to in the course of this debate. But the proposition here is, has it helped or undermined the working class? And if that means that that whole process of globalization, that whole process of greater integration, partly furthered by public policy, partly advanced by technological innovations has benefited the working class leaves them better off. And without it, they'd be worse off. If you're convinced of that at the end of tonight, then I would ask you to vote against the motion. Thank you."

    "data": "I want to say thank you to IQ Squared  the awesome staff. Great to be here at the Ideas Festival and great to be here with my friends Jason and James. Yes, I have a sore throat. I feel much better than I sound. If it helps, close your eyes and pretend you're listening to Barry White. That helps our side. But I apologize for that. Again, I feel okay I just sound funky. Thea and I are arguing for the motion that globalization has lastingly hurt millions of working class families. For the next few minutes I'll take you through the theory and the evidence in support of the motion. Expanded trade has thrown the working class into much more competition than they experienced before trade with lower wage countries took off. Now, economic theory and I'm quoting the trade economist Danny Roderick [spelled phonetically] here, predicts quote that low skilled workers are unambiguously worse off as a result of trade liberalization, so, directly contradicting some of the points that Jason just made. This notion that production workers in richer countries lose out, so we're the richer countries, that workingclass workers in countries like ours lose out when trade expands with poor countries, is not a special case of a particular model. Roderick says, and I'm quoting again, This is standard economic fare familiar to all trade economists, even if not voiced too loudly in the public. Well, Thea and I are here to voice it loudly today, or at least as loudly as I can given my throat. But theory only tells you where to look. It doesn't tell you what's actually happening. First, our openness to trade has basically tripled over the last four decades as the stagnation has set in. But prior to the period of expanded trade, working class compensation doubled along with productivity growth. Since then, since the period of expanded trade, working class compensation has grown only 12 percent while productivity is up 74 percent. So, 74 percent on productivity, 12 percent over 45 years real, now I say inflation adjusted and that's a very important point, because again, Jason was talking about the price effects, the advantageous price effects. They're built in to this real compensation calculation. It takes account of those gains. Had working class compensation kept up with productivity over the period of expanded trade, it would have been $15 per hour higher and that translates into $30,000 a year for working class workers. Let's take a good proxy for I think the working class blue collar manufacturing workers, okay? In the period before trade expanded, their paycheck grew 3 percent per year consistently from the late '40s to the mid '70s. Since then it has grown 0 percent. Again, over 45 years. In fact, the real wage of a bluecollar manufacturing worker was about $22 in today's dollars in 1973. Again, all inflation adjusted so price effects from trade are embedded in these calculations. Last month it was a dollar lower. It was $21 per hour and that's 45 years later. Now, you might be thinking oh, these are completely different groups of workers, and of course, they are, but that just further bolsters our argument. These workers are more experienced. They're more highly educated. They're more productive and yet they earn less. Their living standards have been undermined. Next there's the evidence of the China shock. Careful analysis finds that the sharp increase in the imbalanced trade with China in the 2000s explains about 40 percent of the job losses in factory jobs in those years. That's about a million jobs in manufacturing highly geographically concentrated, by the way, which is important given the way electoral politics is played out in this space. Spill overs from the China shock to other sectors led to the loss of another million jobs. Now, Thea and I are not arguing that trade is the sole factor responsible for all these trends. You already heard a little bit about automation and technology but teasing apart these factors is much harder than economists make it sound. Consider that advances in shipping technology have significantly lowered containership loading by about 90 percent and that the internet has just fueled a crossborder financial flows, as Jason was just saying, we agree with that, but it is obvious, it is obvious to us that technology facilitates globalization, which brings us right back to this institutional context within which both technology and globalization are taking place and we're left with two opposing propositions. One, expanded trade puts large groups of American workers into global competition which hurts their living standards and two, even with those losses, increased trade is in the aggregate progrowth, as our opposition has stated. And the contention that holds them together  that ties those two ideas together  is that the benefits of increased trade are such that winners can compensate the losers and still come out ahead. But just because the winners can compensate the losers doesn't mean that they're going to do so. Here, and everywhere else in this debate tonight, we must get away from the abstract truisms and look unflinchingly at the U.S. case. You know, our economy, not only do those benefit the most from trade fail to compensate to the losers, they use their winnings in the context of our pay to play politics to buy the politicians and the policies that will further protect them and enhance their winnings. They don't help the losers of trade. They hurt them. And in that sense, they undermine the middle class, and I ask you to support the motion. Thank you."

    "label": "economics",
    "data": "Thank you. Good evening. Delighted to be here and joined by colleagues to argue this topic. I think it's important to get very specific about what's actually going on. Let's start with a couple stories. So, if you and your nine friends worked in apparel manufacturing in 2000, a decade later, only three of you have jobs. You lost them. In fact, if you take another example  if you worked in a steel  in a textile mill, again, you and your nine friends, in 2000, today only three of you have a job. And it is the case that those jobs have gone overseas. In fact, if you actually look at particular communities  and we try to look at these things in a very microlocalized way  if you are living, for example, in Webster County, in Mississippi, where apparel manufacturing was the dominant economic activity in that county, something like a third of the jobs disappeared overseas. So, it is the case that, in fact, these have been very deep impacts in these local communities. So, if the question is, have any American workingclass members been impacted by globalization, the answer is clearly yes, because these are real people. It has actually happened. But I don't think that's the debate we're asking. But if it's  also the question is, have we done enough to assist those workers transition, get skills, and deal with those  the difficulty of that impact, we have not done enough. I don't  so I don't think that's the debate, and I don't think my colleague and I would dispute any of that. I think  but if  the other hand, the question is whether working class Americans everywhere have fared well or not over the last two, three decades. Again, the answer is they haven't. And I think, some of the statistics that Jared pointed out are true. The working class in America has not done very well. Wage income inequality, wage stagnation, rising costs of living  all of that is absolutely true. But I think it's important to come back to what's actually on the table and the proposition we're debating. And the question is whether, in fact  has globalization been the key reason why the workingclass Americans have suffered? That's the proposition, not whether American workingclass members are not doing well. So, on that question, that's where Jason and I have a different point of view, and actually think it's  globalization has actually benefited the working class. Now, Jason has made a lot of the arguments that we would make, so I won't repeat them  although I'm sure we'll get into them. But I think it's also important to think about  if we are talking about the working class across America, who are they? So, I think a few things are very important. If you look at the people who are typically thought of as working class, some  there's about 75 million of them out of roughly the 125 million workers who are in the non farm sector in the economy. So, it's about 60 percent of the people in  working in the economy. It's a big part. If you look at where they work, most of them work  so, the majority of them don't work in these directly traded [spelled phonetically] sectors. In fact, by various estimates, the proportion of the workingclass Americans who work in these traded sectors that face globalization is about 20 percent. The rest are working other places. They're working retail. They're working a whole bunch of other places. So, we need to very clear about which  what proportion of Americans in the working class are directly facing the impacts of globalization? Jason has already pointed out, and I think it's important to remember that, in fact, if you look at the working class, they're also consumers. These are families who are trying to earn a living and so forth, and we know that, in fact, a big portion of what they spend money on is purchasing products, goods, and services, many of which are traded products goods and services, whether they themselves work in the traded sector or not it doesn't matter, but they're purchasing these products and services. So, I think it's important to recognize who they are as we think about the impacts of globalization and quite often we end up conflating what's happened with the workingclass Americans generally with what's happened to in particular the manufacturing or traded sectors specifically, saying that's an important thing we should keep in mind. But I want to make another point in my opening remarks, which is I think if we are asking the question what's happened to the workingclass Americans, it's important we actually think about who are the real culprits? Are we scapegoating [spelled phonetically] globalization or not? So, I won't repeat the statistics that Jared point out about income stagnation and all that. They're all true. The American working class hasn't fared very well. But let's look at who the culprits are. So, I'm going to look at two places. Let's take manufacturing, which is often the epicenter for a lot of these points that I made. If you look at manufacturing itself specifically and you look at the job losses we've had, most careful studies when they try to attribute what proportion of the jobs we've lost to manufacturing have been lost to offshoring or jobs being sent away, the estimates typically range between about 13 and the highest I've seen is 33 percent. Our own work suggests it's 20 percent. Some other careful work that's been quoted by Jared, by David Auter [spelled phonetically] and others, has a number that's in the 20something percent. No one is saying it was 90 percent. We can debate in that small range. So, it's important to keep that in mind. So, if that wasn't  if offshoring and globalization wasn't the reason, what are the other reasons? One of them is technology and automation. A lot of routinized tasks have actually served to get automated. I studied robotics and I do a lot of that work and you can see it. In fact, the question I would ask often is pick any factory that's been built in the last five years anywhere in the world and go look to see how many people work there. It doesn't matter where it is, not very many. So, what we're doing in terms of automating how factories and manufacturing plants work has had a big impact on this. So,  and then if you also ask the question in manufacturing so what about the rest of it? So, some of this is competition. We  there are lots of countries that have trade surpluses in manufacturing sectors, whether it's Germany and others. If you actually look at what's happened, so take automotive sector, for example."

    "data": "Thank you so much, everyone. I'll start by saying that I realize that our side is making a fairly unpopular argument. When you hear the word social media, you probably think fake news, Russia hackers, bots, trolls, echo chambers, generally bad things. I get that. But the resolution here is not social media always brings out the best in humanity. The resolution is also not Facebook can do whatever it wants and we'll be okay with it. The resolution is essentially a world with social media is more democratic than a world without it. For evidence of this, I'd like to start by pointing to some examples outside of the United States. I spent 10 years interviewing internet activists in countries like China, Cuba, and Russia asking them how social media changed their lives. Fast forward until today and I think there's a widespread impression that in these countries the governments have won, right? Because China still has pervasive internet censorship. Cuba is hardly a democracy and Putin is still very much in power. However, this really should not come as a surprise. If we are disappointed by those outcomes it's because our expectations were out of whack. Social media is a tool. It does not singlehandedly create revolutions nor does it single handedly bring about a change in government. If we have that impression it has to do with media hype and general overexuberance around the time of the Arab Spring. What social media does do is widen the space for a democracy and I think China is a good example of that. China with social media is more democrat than China without social media. Before the internet in China there was one public voice, the state. There was one official version of history and there was official media. Now, there is an explosion of voices. We Chat, China's main messaging app by some accounts, has one billion monthly active users. But it's not just about freedom of speech. Social media is essential for promoting freedom of assembly, something that we in the United States take for granted. But in authoritarian countries it is not easy to find people who share your views and your goals, especially if those goals are counter to the official narrative. So now in a country like China you have people from all over the country joining forces to protest local corruption, to demand a cleaner environment, or recently truckers protesting high fuel costs. This is a major development. Now, let's turn to Russia. When you hear Russia and internet, again you're probably thinking about statesponsored hackers. The story is much bigger than that, however. In Russia, the opposition has used social media very effectively to achieve their goals. Alexi Navalni [spelled phonetically], for example, Russia's  Putin's main political opponent, has used social media to call for largescale protests and recently even tried to challenge Putin as  for president of Russia. This didn't work out obviously. Before this debate I actually reached out to Navalni and asked him given all these setbacks that the Russian opposition has experienced, does he still believe that social media is good for democracy in Russia. And his answer was a resounding yes. In a country with almost total censorship, he said he has access to millions via YouTube. His YouTube channel has over two million subscribers. Without the internet we would all be dissidents, Navalni told me. The only people who would know that we exist are foreign journalists. Thanks to the internet. Thanks to social media, he has been able to emerge as a politician. Was it enough to make him the leader of the country? No. But without social media the situation would be a lot more black and white. So finally, let's turn to the United States. I believe that Facebook is being scapegoated for revealing some of the dark sides of America. At the end of the day Facebook is just a mirror reflecting us and that mirror has revealed a nation that is deeply divided, susceptible to misinformation, willing to promote lies and spread hate. Some of the Russian propaganda on social media was taken from content that was posted by real Americans and neither Russia nor Facebook forced anybody to share misinformation. I also want to quickly mention my own experience in Silicon Valley, which caused me to see these platforms a little bit differently. I heard a lot of people saying, I'm so sick of Twitter and Facebook. We need a platform for civil, thoughtful conversation. So, a few years ago, I teamed up with two former Google employees to create just that platform. It was called Parleo [spelled phonetically], and it's since been acquired by Quora. Basically, what it was a platform for civil, thoughtful conversation. And it wasn't a perfect product. It had its flaws, but it did real some important truths about user behavior. First is that thoughtful debate takes time. Second, thoughtful debate is unlikely to go viral. And third, civility can be kind of boring. And basically, we are in a moment right now where we  the users  are addicted to this sugar rush of sensationalism and virality."

I just want to remind you that what this debate is actually about is the proposition resolved  Social Media is Good for Democracy  not that it leads to more democratic conversation, but it leads to better forms of governance. As John said, my story began in Silicon Valley more than 35 years ago. I was a technology optimist. I was lucky enough to be Mark Zuckerberg's  one of his mentors from 2006 to 2009, before the current business model was created. I was able to introduce him and help to bring in Sheryl Sandburg into the company. I've known Google, YouTube, and Twitter  three of the other social media platforms, since their very earliest days. I have had no relationships with Snapchat or to WeChat, but I pay really close attention. I worked in political campaigns since I was 12 years old and I've worked for a member of Congress. In January of 2016, I was on vacation and saw memes that were misogynistic and related to the Bernie Sanders campaign. They were not actually from the campaign, but somebody was spending money to make sure they spread virally on Facebook. On June of 2016, Brexit happened. That was the first time I realized that Facebook, as a platform, gave an advantage to inflammatory campaigns over neutral and positive ones. In October of 2016, after the news broke that the Russians were attempting to interfere in our election, I reached out to Zuck and to Sheryl with my fears, and I spent three months trying to persuade them just to do an investigation  find out what was going on. I assumed Facebook was a victim. They claimed they weren't responsible. They're a platform; not a media company. They aren't responsible for third parties. The transformation in my view of social media began with a couple hypotheses. First, that rampant manipulation of users is not a bug; it's actually a feature. It's designed into the system. The Russians did not hack Facebook, they used the tools precisely as they were designed to be used. Secondly, the companies themselves are complicit. The business model and algorithms are built on behavior modification and manipulation, by design, because that is good for profits. They sell access to their users to anyone who will pay, because that's good for business. They will embed employees in campaigns, conferring an asymmetric advantage. As currently constructed, social media is not good for democracy. It collapses fact. It hurts deliberation. It undermines the public square and civility. My partner, Tristan Harris [spelled phonetically], has said that the business model is the problem. It encourages addiction, which makes users easy to manipulate, to contrast what our opponents said. Platforms use surveillance to build incredibly detailed portraits. They then prey on the weakest aspects of human psychology. The smartphone is a slot machine that enables engagement every waking moment. The platforms then control your choices. They tickle you. They appeal to your fear of missing out, your need for social approval, your need for social reciprocity. They give you endless news feeds and autoplay to keep you on the site and if you ever leave they interrupt you with notifications. Surveillance and brain hacking have generated $1.4 trillion worth of market value and wealth for Google and Facebook alone. Manipulation of users is the goal. Undermining democracy is merely a side effect. The future of democracy is in the hands of corporations with user bases as large or larger than the largest religions in the world. These are corporations with authoritarian cultures driven by profits. They favor disinformation over fact because it's better for engagement. Earlier this year MIT pointed out that information spreads 70 percent farther and six times faster than facts. These platforms are designed to take advantage of that and I will stipulate the social media can in principle be employed to benefit democracy. We've seen examples with Black Lives Matter, the women's march, indivisible in the march for our lives. But social media, in contrast to our opponent's point, is actually only good at germinating political action. It is terrible at sustaining engagement. If social media were good for democracy it should have deterred the global rise of populism, demagoguery, illiberalism, and authoritarianism. Stanford political scientist Larry Diamond notes that between 2000 and 2014 there were 25 breakdowns in democracy. There have been many more since and the rate of change is accelerating on the negative side. It's almost going vertically down. Social media encourages people to be passive consumers not active citizens. Facebook is 2.2 billion. Truman Shows, everybody entitled to their own reality. Filter bubbles make opinions more rigid and more extreme. Users have no need to engage, much less to compromise. And Larry Diamond points out, there are four key elements of democracy, free and fair elections, active participation by the people in civic life, protection of human rights for all, and a rule of law which applies equally to everyone. We will make the case that social media has harmed all four. Our opponents must prove that social media is actually good for democracy as practiced in the world, not just that it gets some people engaged online in Russia. I want to ask for your vote. I want you to vote against this proposition. I want to take back democracy. I want to thank you for your time."

    "data": "That cacophony that you're hearing is the sound of democracy. Yes, it's noisy and it's messy, but if you truly listen it's glorious. For at long last we are hearing voices we could never, ever hear before. The internet has brought diversity to the public square and the public conversation. Going around gatekeepers like me, I'm a journalist, an old white man gatekeeper. Around institutions and this is why this scares them so much and so finally we have the opportunity as John has mentioned and Roger did, that without social media we would not have had Black Lives Matter or #MeToo or the amazing work of the Parkland students. So, social media has already proven to be good for democracy. Are there also bad voices on the net? Yes. Just as there are on Times Square as well. And it's important to know that they come in various flavors. Some are motivated by economics as spammers, some by psychology or warped psychology, as trolls, some politically as propagandists from Russia. Should the platforms be doing more about this? Yes, of course, but what exactly? This is all so new. I believe strongly in the power of openness, but I've come to learn that extreme openness probably does breed trolls. The platforms probably should have had more anticipation of the bad things that could've happened, but who could've seen this? I want them to be more transparent, more collaborative, more open. I want them to build a technology that favors community over mere conversation. There is much work to do but it's early days. But let's be honest. We have met the problem, and it is us. The problem here is not technology at all; it is human behavior on technology. And who handles that? Who normally deals with the limits of human behavior? Government. The government doesn't know what to do, so it outsources the problem and the solution to the platforms. Now, I'm also scared about government taking on its true role here, because I think we've seen many missteps in the regulation of the Net in Europe, where I think they've gone far too early and they've had an impact on free speech, on history, on all kinds of issues we can talk about later. And I think they're  these unintended consequences come out of, potentially, a moral panic that I see developing out of good intention from our colleagues on the other side  but that, in the end of the day, tries to blame all of society's problems on Facebook, and Twitter, and Google, as if they caused it. Well, I stand here today in confession, that they didn't cause it: I helped cause it. As a journalist, as a member of media. We polarized this nation and the world. We invented the business model of clickbait that leads to cats and Kardashians, and ultimately leads to Donald Trump  for remember, the heads of both CNN and CBS said that Donald Trump may be bad for this country, but he's good for their business. We hold a great deal of responsibility here, and we shouldn't just act as if it is the platforms. Indeed, I saw my own dear members of my family brainwashed by a certain TV network. So, is social media the cause? No. Is it the cure? No. But I have to say that these are early days. What social media and the Internet do is disrupt society in fundamental ways. That's why there's so much fear about this right now. And I want to remind you about the timetable of Gutenberg. He invented moveable type in about the year 1450. It took 150 days, a centuryandahalf before anyone thought to invent the newspaper. It was another couple centuries until the 1800s before it became mass. 1950 before television started to come in. 1994 before the Net came in  the Web. That's a very long timeline. I will argue to you that we are in the very early days of the Net. We don't know what it is yet. It is too soon to limit it, define it, regulate it. We have to let people go where they may. And so, I'll remind you, from Elizabeth Eisenstein [spelled phonetically]  a key scholar of Gutenberg  how the book scared the bejesus of people when it came out en masse, that there was a complaint about an information overload, about a new age of barbarity, about making us stupid, about unrestrained discursivity [spelled phonetically]  which is what I think we're doing right here. So, the fear was the book was going to do this, but we figured it out, society. We human beings are smart. We understood how to deal with this new technology. It took some time. It took some wars. All true. But we did figure out where to go. So, I would say to you here today that what you need to do is vote for the future. I would argue to you that you should have the faith, and trust, and respect for your children and grandchildren, that they will know what to do with this  that they will understand how this is their world and their tool. And we are  frankly speaking, for everyone in the room  we are too old to understand this new world. It is their world, and we have to give them the freedom and the tools to do what they wish to do it. So, I beg you  I urge you  vote for your children. Vote for your grandchildren. Vote for the future. Vote for optimism. Vote for respect to the intelligence of your fellow man and woman. Vote for our side. Thank you."

    "data": "I, for one, am not too old to be extremely upset about the trajectory that we're on. They're asking you to vote for some theoretical, abstract vision of the good that social media could do. But look at the world that we live in. Before I get into the question of democracy, I wanted to take a brief deviation into a personal question, which is, I wanted to ask, how many people in this room sleep with their phones? I did not mean it like that, pervert. I meant, I have to keep my phone in my basement, three stories below my bedroom, because I know if it's next to my bed, I'm going to reach for it, and grab it, and get stuck in an endless scroll. Roger likes to say that he's so addicted to his phone that the only question is, will he check it before he pees in the morning or while he's peeing in the morning? This is not an accident. These devices, these social platforms, are behavior modification machines. They've been designed to addict us. They're engineered to elicit emotional responses and so they can wish for these pure reactions, but the system in the end is rigged. It's manipulated. There's a reason that the authoritarian guys always win in the end. How does the system work? Well, they take data. What is data? Data is this intimate portrait of the inside of your head. They know what you like. They know what gives you pleasure. They know what causes you anxiety. They delete nothing. You start to type a post on Facebook and you delete it, it saved on their packrat servers. And so, then they take this information and then they use it to sort how news comes to you in your feed. And so, the information is organized in such a way to try to keep you engaged, to keep you addicted on their site for as long as possible. Now, it's not hard to see the democratic danger. These platforms are giving people what they want. They're giving people information and news that confirms their own biases. They're triggering emotional responses to keep them engaged on their sites for as long as possible and this is the reason we've started to see the formulation of these filter bubbles where we're pushed into our ideological corners. I want to give you an example. The Wall Street Journal has something called red feed, blue feed. So, they show you if you're a liberal you can see what your news was this morning. Item number one, the insecure president displays antics  the insecure president's antics on display. Item number two, he knows he'll never be as popular as Barak Obama. Now let's turn to the conservative feed. Number one, Donald Trump, high energy, strong stamina. Number two, a break [unintelligible] story, Trump goes on offensive. They are pushing us into these corners and we're getting information that confirms our biases. We become intellectually weakened. We become susceptible to fake news, to propaganda, to demagoguery [spelled phonetically]. These trends that are so rampant in our world right now. There's  one third of all Americans believe in something that is demonstrably false, whether it's arguments about vaccination, arguments about climate change, arguments about the world being flat, and they're being pushed to these positions by this filter bubble. In addition, we all know that we're becoming a more ideologically polarized society, a more ideologically polarized world. We exist within filter bubbles. Now, social media doesn't cause this in its entirety, but it has exacerbated that trend. According to the New York Times,  sorry, according to NBC News, 52 percent of Americans have not had a conversation over the course of the last year with somebody that they substantively politically disagree with that. How is compromise possible? How are our politics going to function in such a world? And I mean the answer pretty clearly based on the United States and many, many other places around the world is that they don’t. These platforms privilege the shrill. In order to get attention, you have to shout and the people who shout end up getting shared more and more. And I don't think I need to do more to illustrate this point than to point you in the direction of a certain feed of a major American politician to show you the way in which shrillness floats to the top. And it's created this world where we have an epidemic of incivility where when you exist within your filter bubble it's harder and harder to entertain heterodox [spelled phonetically] thoughts and if you do you get shamed. People are cowed into suppressing thoughts for fear of eliciting the anger of the mob. Finally, the one antidote to fake news is real news and that is disappearing because Facebook and Google and the other platforms have amassed monopolies in online advertising. 73 percent of all online dollars go to Google and Facebook. These are big systems we're talking about and they've come at the expense of media. Over the course of the last 25 years we've seen a 60 percent reduction in the number of reporters. Media has grown dependent on Facebook and so they end up producing clickbait because that's the only way that they can survive. Facebook values become their values. Now, really ultimately this is a debate about citizenship. We ask so much of citizens every two years, every four years. And if they're fed fake news, lies, if they're being manipulated  if they can't hold their attention span, then how are we going to expect them to do their duty? Thank you."

    "data": "Okay, great. So, any debate has to begin with a definition of terms. So, the Oxford Dictionary defines safe spaces as quote, A place or environment in which a person or category of people can feel confident that they will not be exposed to discrimination, criticism, harassment, or any other emotional or physical harm. Key to that definition is freedom from emotional harm. If we're only talking about physical harm, I don't think there would be much room for debate. No one thinks campuses should be places where assaults, hazards, or other physical harms can occur. Relatedly, I don't think anybody could argue against safe spaces categorically. If I lie on a hammock, reading, or romp in the backyard with my pet, I'm not going to be exposed to discrimination, criticism, harassment, or other emotional harm. Nothing wrong with those kinds of safe spaces. Likewise, at a Shabat dinner on a college campus, an Iftar celebration, or a meeting of Bernie supporters, freedom from emotional harm might be virtually assured. Freedom of association mandates that those groups  Black House, Hillel House  are perfectly permissible on campus. Clubs, teams, and religious associations are a vital and vibrant part of university life. The key is that students enter into those settings voluntarily, and the bonds that unite them and the span for disagreement are things that the students navigate themselves. And I really don't think there's much disagreement about those kinds of places. The use of the term safe spaces that has provoked controversy, and what we're really here to discuss tonight, has two elements. One is where it obtains. Is it to large swaths of a university   a whole dining hall, a residential college, a classroom, or even, as some have argued, a campus as a whole? Places where students have no choice but to be. The second contentious element is the idea that administrators or institutions should be charged with policing or governing what speech is permissible and what is out of bounds. Now, to go back to the definition, if that policing were limited to harassment or discrimination, there'd also be no room for argument. Federal and state civil rights laws and precedents require that both public and private colleges protect students from unlawful harassment and discrimination, and those are legallydefined terms. So, if it were simply a matter of enforcing those second  settled legal requirements, we wouldn't need the concept of safe space. It's those other elements of the definition  exposure to criticism or any other emotional harm  those distinguish enforcement of a safe space from simply upholding legal protections. And that's really the crux of the matter tonight. For a university administration to assume the obligation to protect students from criticism or other emotional harm would be dangerous, I argue, for six reasons. And I'll go through them quickly. First of all, focusing on enforcing safe spaces is a dangerous distraction from the university's core role. Kids come to college to gain skills, exposure, connections, and networks. If colleges concentrate on enforcing safe spaces, that's going to detract from their responsibility to afford students the opportunity to deal with difficult ideas and uncomfortable situations and build the confidence they need that they can survive. The goal of the university should be to make students feel secure and supported enough so that they can tolerate some emotional and psychological discomfort, not to eliminate such discomforts entirely. Second, enforcing safe spaces can exacerbate dangerous divisions in our society. Our society is deeply polarized. By sealing off large parts of the campus to guard against certain ideas and viewpoints we're going to make that problem worse. We foreclose the possibility of engagement and bridging of differences. Third, defining safety is vague and inherently subjective running the risk of viewpointbased discrimination. A space that's safe for supporters of the Israeli government could feel very unsafe for supporters of Palestinian activism or vice versa. A space that's safe for religious Muslims may feel unsafe to critics of Islam. For universities to adjudicate such spaces runs the risk of first amendment violations for public universities and a betrayal of purpose for private schools like Yale. Fourth, declaring safe spaces can leave students dangerously exposed once they graduate. If students believe they need and should expect intellectual and emotional safety on campus they may be frighteningly ill prepared for the world they encounter thereafter. Fifth, the conflation of speech and violence is dangerous. Use of the terms safe and unsafe inevitably blurs into questions of physical safety. Some argue safe spaces claiming that speech in itself can constitute an act of violence, but if we accept that, if I say something that you have  that offends you, you might be justified in punching me in the nose. That escalates confrontations unnecessarily and dangerously. And finally, the emphasis on safe spaces is triggering a heavyhanded backlash from state legislatures and the Department of Justice that could endanger inclusivity on campuses. Seventeen U.S. states have introduced legislation to police speech on campus and the Department of Justice has intervened in a series of cases. If you don't believe that the government intervention of free speech is the answer you should vote against  or for the proposition that safe spaces are dangerous. Thank you so much."

    "data": "Thank you all for being here. I am going to try and convince you that safe spaces are not new. They're not unusual. They are not really about college campuses and they are not a sign of weakness. My basis point is that all of us are used to safe spaces. They are places to regroup, to gather with people we like, to gather with people we trust, and think to gather. We call them home. We call them churches. We call them clubhouses. I call them beer night. But it's a standard part of human nature. Free speech is important. I believe in free speech. I've made a career out of writing about free speech. But nobody believes that everyone should be exposed to unlimited free speech everywhere and anywhere and once one accepts that idea one accepts the idea of safe spaces, which is why you should vote against this motion. Most obviously, all of us are going to go home, in my case tomorrow. I'm going to hang out with friends and family. That's a safe space. I expect it to be a safe space. Everyone, my opponents in this debate, feel the same way about their homes. That's a normal part of life. Now think about students at a residential campus. Sure, part of the reason they're there is to learn, to debate, to be exposed to new ideas, to learn how to refute ideas they disagree with, but that campus is their home and indeed it is their home in a more full way than even my home. I don't spend 24/7 at home. I leave for my job. They are on campus 24/7. If we all expect to be able to go to a place and feel safe, why shouldn't they? They are after all young people. They have the same rights as we do. Furthermore, when we talk about safe spaces are not limited to home. We often meet with people outside of home. We go to places where we know we'll be comfortable. The idea that college students, the only safe space they're entitled to is their tiny little dorm room, I have seen dorm rooms. You can't have much of a safe space there. It's more like a safe crouch. That's just not plausible. You need spaces on campus. You need spaces in your home area. And I have no trouble with the idea that college administrators can accommodate that by designated parts of campus, not all of campus, I am not  I think that's going far too far, but parts of campus, rooms, buildings, as safe spaces because that just gives students the same things that all of us assume we have. So, what about free speech? The first amendment protects free speech, but the first amendment, as Suzanne said, also protects freedom of association and that is what I am talking about. What I'm talking about when I talk about gathering together with likeminded people, people you trust, people you agree with is in fact freedom of association. It is within these intimate associations that we develop our ideas. We develop our strategies for how to communicate our ideas. We decide what we believe in. We decide what we don't believe in. Speech does not come out of a vacuum, and human beings are not autonomous entities. We are social animals. And we develop our ideas together in these safe spaces, called associations. And that is why, sometimes, associational privacy trumps freedom of speech. Think of it this way. I want to gather together a group of people to discuss ways to defend immigrants' rights. I might do that in my house, but I might do that at a seminar room at my law school, because that might be the best place to do it. Are antiimmigrant activists allowed to walk in and express their views? No. Those places  even if it is a part of a college campus that I work at  is a safe space. I work at a public campus. It is governed by the First Amendment, but it doesn't matter. I still am entitled to use that safe space for my own purposes. And I think part of what's going on is, the safe spaces debate has become conflated with the debate over controversial speakers on campus, usually conservative speakers, triggering protests. Those are separate questions. I do not think  sometimes people have said that the entire campus should be a safe space, and therefore it's the same issue. That goes too far. And they're driven by completely different concerns. I think that the safe spaces debate is a debate driven by a desire to be left alone, which I think is perfectly reasonable. The controversial speakers debate is driven by anger about  anger over ideas that students believe  sometimes legitimately, sometimes not  to be out of bounds. I think we really need to separate those two questions, because the controversial speaker stuff is complicated. I will say this, though, about the controversial speakers. Speakers have a right to speak, including controversial ones. They're entitled to come onto campus. Let me be very clear about that. Students have a right to speak against them. There are free speech rights at issue on both sides when protesters protest speakers. Obviously, violence is over the top, and obviously, university administrators have the difficult job of accommodating those two interests. But that's a completely different matter. Safe spaces, I think, are standard, normal, and students are entitled to it. So, please vote against this motion. Thank you."

    "data": "Good evening. Thanks so much. Safe spaces in the sense of safe spaces that protect students from offensive or disagreeable speech are anathema to the First Amendment and the freedom of expression that we all hold sacrosanct. Safe spaces infringe upon core fundamental First Amendment principles. The first one is the socalled marketplace of ideas. It's traced back to Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in his dissenting opinion in Abrams v. United States in 1919, when he wrote, When men have realized  fighting faiths, they have come to believe that the ultimate good desired is better reached through free trade and ideas. That the best test of thought is the freedom of the thought to get itself accepted into the competition of the market. And the United States Supreme Court, in Keyishian v. Board of Regents in 1967, proclaimed that the college classroom is peculiarly the marketplace of ideas. If you have a safe space, then you are preventing certain ideas from entering the marketplace, and that conflicts with core fundamental First Amendment principles. The second principle is the counterspeech doctrine. And the counterspeech doctrine essentially means that when we are confronted with harmful, obnoxious, and even repugnant speech, our first response should not to be to censor that speech, but to counter it  to show why it's wrong, to come up with a better alternative. This theory is traced back to Justice Lewis Brandeis [spelled phonetically], a contemporary of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. In Whitney v. California in 1927, he wrote, If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies to avert the evils by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence. The problem with safe spaces is it leads to the silencing and suppression of speech. We don't want that. We want more speech. The third core fundamental first amendment principle is that the first amendment protects a great deal of offensive, obnoxious and even repugnant speech. And the United States Supreme Court has expressed this eloquently many times. For example, Justice William Brennan [phonetic], in 1989, in a case called Texas versus Johnson, which involved an individual Gregory Lee Johnson [phonetic] who burned an American flag in Dallas, Texas, outside a political convention. Justice Brennan wrote, If there's a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment it's that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because it finds it offensive or disagreeable. The idea of shielding students from ideas directly contradicts that principle, right? We want to protect offensive and even disagreeable speech. That's how we learn. The fourth fundament first amendment principle is that a lot of speech is in the eye of the beholder. What's agreeable to one person may be disagreeable to another. Justice John Marshal Harlan [phonetic], II, expressed this principle eloquently in Cohen versus California in 1971 when he famously wrote, One man's vulgarity is another's lyric. Right? What is offensive to some people may not be offensive to another person. That's why these safe spaces are dangerous. And then just think about human history. Sir Isaac Newton, Copernicus [phonetically spelled], Galileo, Albert Einstein, they were all ridiculed, ostracized when they first issued some of their theories. If we had safe spaces would we shut all those great thinkers down? No. We want speech to enter the marketplace of ideas. We want to counter negative speech with positive speech. We want to protect even offensive, obnoxious, and repugnant speech because that's the essence of who we are and that's the essence of education. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you. There are a lot of good ideas out here and I don't know if this is actually a marketplace or not, but clearly there are strong feelings on both sides of this issue and the issue can be distorted so that it's easier to take a stand. So, no one is really arguing that all students all the time should be protected against any disagreeable idea. Nobody has ever argued that. That's just never happened. The idea of safe spaces originated right after the second World War. It actually comes from corporate America. Corporate America said you know one of the problems with the business world today is that people who work at my company are afraid to tell me the truth. So, I go  I'm the president of Wesleyan. I go up to say, What do you think of how I'm doing at Wesleyan? And people say, Oh, you're doing fine, sir. I say, You don't have to call me sir. Just call me President Roth. And they don't actually tell me the truth. So, after the second World War some good social psychologists, mostly from central Europe, came along and said, What we need here is a safe space. That's the words they used. They said we need a safe space where employees can say,  you know, President Roth, you've got your head in the wrong direction. You are looking in the wrong places. You are paying attention to the wrong places. You are paying attention to the wrong things. You are adjudicating things you don't know about. And they could do that without fear of retaliation or attack. That was the definition of a safe space. Still works pretty well for me. You can speak your mind without fear of retaliation or attack. When I was a student at Wesleyan in the '70s it was pretty normal for professors to come to class and think if they were a male professor and coach, [indiscernible] was pretty new at Wesleyan in those days, they said well, I'm a nerdy 28yearold I want to have sex with someone who's 19 my students are available. So, they use their powers of free expression to comment on students' legs, on their attire. I had a student just call me from my era a few weeks ago, and said that  well, her professor asked her to come and see him about her thesis. And she was honored, and she said to me, I was probably silly to be honored. I said, No, you weren't silly to be honored. She didn't know what he really wanted to do was to take her out and to take her home. Now, he said, I'm just exercising my professorial duties. I care about that student. Whereas one of my colleagues said to the provost not too long ago, I want to just take the relationship to the next level. Yeah. See, we need a safe space for a guy like that. We need a safe space so students can learn, so they can tolerate disagreement. When I was a young professor at a school where there were almost no African Americans, one of my best students  an African American woman  she would routinely have professors ask her about the black experience, and other students go up to her and say, Can I feel your hair? They didn't mean any harm, but she felt it was an unsafe space. Not because they were disagreeable ideas but because people weren't treating her as a person. When I start my Philosophy in Film class  which I teach pretty regularly  I say to my students, Tonight, you're going to watch a film about genocide. It's horrible. There are images in this film that should turn your stomach. Next week, you're going to watch a film about murder  police officers brutally gunned down and the wrong guy sent to jail. It's a documentary. The third week  they call it Monday nights with Roth: How to ruin your week  we watch these films on Monday nights  the third week we're watching a film about child abuse. And I tell them this because, in my experience of teaching this course, some of them are so shocked at the movies that they can't handle it. So, I tell them this in the first class  I said, If you can't handle genocide, murder, child abuse in the first semester, this is not the course for you. Take another course. I'm not changing the course: we're going to talk about these issues and how to tell the truth about them. But if you can't handle it, this is not the course for you. And then I tell them, jokingly  And if you really love this stuff, get help. Because I want them to see, oh, it's going to be hard, but actually, we're in this together. We're supporting each other. It's safe enough to disagree. It's safe enough to tolerate real painful subjects; and what may not be so painful to me might be very painful to another kind of student who has a different kind of history. So, I urge you to vote against this motion, that safe spaces are dangerous."

    "data": "Thank you very much. Automation will crash democracy. These are profoundly troubled times. I want to tell you two things that describes that and then give you two stories to explain why automation will crash democracy. First the two things. Number one, the United States  and not just the United States but almost all of the advanced industrial democracies in the world today are more divided than we have ever experienced in our lifetimes. That should trouble us. I know it does. It is about Brexit. It is about Trump. It is about the elections we've seen in Hungary and Turkey and Italy and even in France and Germany. One in six Americans today say that they would prefer strong military rule to a democracy. And that is not because they think democracy doesn't exist. They think the system is rigged against them. Second point. China. For the last 30 years something that the West has truly believed is that as China got wealthier, as they became a middleincome country, they would need to politically reform or they would fail. That's wrong. And what we know today is that they are now a middleincome country. They are more consolidated politically. They have not politically reformed. Xi Jinping has recently announced himself effectively as president for life. State owned enterprise and state capitalism is stronger than it was before. They are building an alternative model to liberal democracies. So, the two stories. Why is that true? There are a number of reasons, but automation is truly problematic for two reasons. The first. Back in the 1960s Milton Friedman went to China and he saw a big canal being built with thousands and thousands of Chinese workers. And they were all using shovels. They didn't have any heavy machinery. And he couldn't understand why. He asked the Chinese handler Where are all of the cranes and the bulldozers? He said, You don't understand. He said We do that because we want these people to all have jobs. That's the intention. Friedman said Oh, I understand. I've got a great idea. Instead of using bulldozers why don't you give them spoons? And see, then you could hire a lot more of them. We all laugh because we say well of course, you know, I mean silly communists. The capitalists know how to build things. We know how to grow. Turn to 2018 when instead of globalization we have automation where so many more jobs are being displaced if not go away completely and suddenly you realize the Chinese have the one political system in the world that's actually oriented towards insuring the hiring of inefficient labor. In the United States we right now have lower unemployment than at any point in 2000s, 3.9 percent. It feels awesome and yet wages have been flat for the last 40 years. What's it going to feel like in the United States when we hit a recession? Does anyone believe that our political system is really prepared to do for the average worker and make the American dream feel for the average worker what the Chinese dream feels for the Chinese worker today? I don't think so. That's the first story. The second story. Little different story. Twentyfive years ago  this is a group that probably reads the New Yorker. I get that sense. Right? You're giving us an evening at IQ Squared. You could be doing something else. You read the New Yorker, right? You remember  you remember this cartoon? It's a cartoon that had a dog on a computer. And it was sitting next to another dog who apparently was not computer literate. And he said to that dog  he said, You know, on the internet no one knows if you're a dog. Right? And that was  it was beautiful. It was the zeitgeist of the internet. The idea was it was empowering, to people, to little puppies. Right? They could learn everything. It was the communications revolution. It's what got us the Arab Spring. People with access to information learned that their governments were corrupt. They didn't want to take it anymore. They communicated with each other. Off they go. It promoted liberal democracy. Now today if you are on the internet and you're a dog  we know. We know what kind of a dog you are. We know what other dogs you're into. We know where you're doing your business, right? We know all of those things. It's not the communications revolution anymore; it's the data revolution. Right? It's the information revolution. It doesn't empower individuals. It's topdown. Today, automationdriven and AIdriven algorithms are dividing liberal democracies. They're ripping apart the fabric of society. We live in something close to an information dystopia. I would define one as one where we get our information filtered through the world's largest advertising company. No one can tell me that automation is promoting liberal democracy in that way. And yet, in China, if you actually surf for something that's a little bit offcenter politically, they don't say, Here, let's something even more offcenter so we can make more money off you. They don't do that. They say, No. Here's what everyone else is surfing. Why don't you surf that? And if you continue to surf these unusual things, we may not hear from you very much anymore. What I'm saying is that automation, both in terms of the disruptive effect on employment and in terms of the disruptive effect on how we consume information, unfortunately, is undermining liberal democracy. And so, yes, I am arguing that automation will crash democracy. Thank you for your support."

    "data": "So, Ian was very spirited, as always. We all know him as a television personality, very passionate. But I read his book, and there's some sentence I found in his book that actually reveals what he really thinks. He said, In 2018, it's too early to know whether the tech revolution will kill more jobs than it creates. Now, I'm from Silicon Valley. And the reality of automation and AI is  I'm not allowed to swear on this show, but you know what I would say if I could. We have no idea of what's happening. AI is the big new thing in Silicon Valley. Every new tech company is basically an automation or AI company: Apple, Facebook, Google. They're all trying to reinvent themselves as AI companies, as artificial intelligence companies, building their products, their platforms, their services around machine learning. But nobody knows how this thing is going to work out. Nobody has any idea  as Ian correctly argues in his bestseller, Us versus Them  that we have no idea in 2018 where we're at. Everyone has different positions. Bill Gates and Elon Musk argue that automation is so powerful, so inevitable, so allconsuming that it will create machines with consciousness. They will be our final invention. They will enslave us. Others argue that we shouldn't concern ourselves at all; that AI is actually rather impractical and that we are exaggerating. To quote, you know, the idea that we're living in these troubling times, of course, is a perpetual theme, a perpetual trope when it comes to readers of the New Yorkers. We pride ourselves on living in troubling times. That's what gives us our pleasure. And I'm afraid to tell you that we aren't. We're not living in any more troubling times than we've ever lived in. We've always created technology that dramatically changes the world, and we've always coped as human beings. One of the troubling things I think about what Ian was presenting is he's presenting us as somehow powerless in the face of this new technology, powerless in the face of automation and AI, powerless to shape our own world. What Ian is suggesting is that we don't have agency. And that is, of course, what computers don't have. Ada Lovelace, the 19th century mathematician who invented the very idea of software, famously said that the one thing software can't do is think for itself. It can't have consciousness. It can't have goals. It can't have agency. It's not human. And that is the reality in 2018, in 2038, and in 2138. The title of this debate is Automation will kill  or will crash  thank you, Robert  will crash democracy. We need to define what automation is. We also need to define will. It's not might. It's not could; it's will. This is a debate which suggests that automation inevitably will crash democracy. It's as if some sort of computer software program  that our societies will shut down because of AI. It doesn't take into account human beings. It doesn't take into account us. Automation, as I suggested, is AI  is this profound revolution in Silicon Valley, but no more profound than the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. We heard this argument before. We've always had pessimistic intellectuals like Ian tell us we live in profoundly troubling times. In the middle of the 19th century, we had exactly the same kind of whiners, telling us that industrialization  would take away everything of value, undermine society, rural society, religion, masculinity, meaning, marriage, blah blah blah. And they were wrong, and they've always been wrong, because the nature of the human condition is to break things and then fix them. We've proved it in the industrial age and we will prove it in the age of automation. As Alina will talk about, there are many, many practical ways in which automation can actually enrich society. So, what exactly is Democracy? We know what automation is. Democracy is one of those slippery words. It's kind of like pornography. We know it when we see it, but we can't define it. I would suggest that democracy is this. Democracy is you guys voting. Democracy is thinking for yourselves and having the autonomy and freedom to shape your world, to articulate your interests. The important thing to bear in mind about this debate is that automation and democracy are entirely different things. Automation is bound up in the what might  one might think of as the inevitable law of technological narrative. Well, as has been phrased in Silicon Valley, Moore's law  MOORE's law  Gordon Moore of Intel. Democracy is what I define in my book, the bestseller, How to Fix the Future"

    "data": "I love listening to technologists, don't you? You always learn so much. You learn, for example, that nothing bad has ever happened since 1800. I'm glad to hear that. They also just have a wonderful way of having their cake and eating it too. The last time I was in Silicon Valley and spoke to a bunch of more senior people there, they were telling me how amazing the world is going to be after the rise of technology. One of them said, Just wait five years. And he pointed out a hotel window at a green field. We're going to have one machine building a house all on its own, and it's going to happen in five years, I promise. And then you ask, What is that going to do to the political system? What's that going to do the economy? Oh, things will be fine somehow. Does automation crash democracy? Well, crash is  you know, it falls to the ground. Many might try and fix it somehow. That's about what Andrew Keen is saying. We're somehow going to fix it once we've crashed it; let's not worry too much about what it's going to look like. Now, let me be clear here about the nature of automation we're talking about, because the argument is always, Oh, people worry, and they've always worried, and it's going to be the same as it is in the past. When you listen carefully to technologists, what they're saying is that we're facing a new kind of automation. That what we're going to get is the rise of a kind of general intelligence, a machine that can rival at least the human intelligence of an average person. And if that happens it is not just a normal technological shift that, you know, the scribes who used to write out books line by line are substituted by the printing machine or anything like that. It would actually mean that most people can no longer find employment. I don't know whether that's going to happen but that's what technologists telling me when I'm in San Francisco. And what I wanted to say today is some of the implications that'll follow if that is true, if 50 percent of jobs really do go away, if most people can no longer find employment. And my argument is very simple. Some of the people who have studied where democracy has been established around the world and where it has failed have come up with a very simple model. They've said democracy takes hold when the cost of tolerating democracy for elites is lower than the cost of quashing democracy. What will automation do? It'll systematically increase the cost of tolerating democracy for elites and decrease the costs of quashing democracy. Why is that the case? Well, the biggest cost to elites of democracy is having to share some of the wealth through progressive taxation, through distribution, and so on. And the more inequality there is in a society the more demand there is for redistribution. Well, as we have the rise of automation as the few people who still have the skills that are really needed can command huge salaries, as a few owners of the means of production, of robots, manage to get more and more of the gains of these technological developments, and as more and more people are out of a job, inequality in our society is going to skyrocket. And over time that'll obviously mean that the losers of these developments are going to demand to get a little bit more of a piece of a pie. Demands for redistribution are going to increase and the cost of tolerating democracy will as well. We might be able to deal with that but at the very same time you'll also see the costs of quashing democracy decrease. We've only ever had democracy in the time period from the French Revolution until today when political leaders needed citizen armies, when we could rely on average citizens to stand up to defend the country against enemies abroad and to keep the peace at home. But you will no longer need that if you have general intelligence because the robots can do that job for you. They can be your security guards. You no longer need to keep the bulk of society happy. You no longer need a middleclass workforce. For the last 150 years capital needed skilled people in the companies. They even needed the cleaner who came by towards the end of a workday to be well compensated enough that you would not be too disruptive and a little friendly to you. Well, if we get general intelligence you no longer need either of those things. You don't need a middle of a range workforce because machines are doing the job. You certainly no longer need a cleaner. So, once you get the incentives aligned in that way, the temptation for elites to say Why should we share more and more of our wealth? Why don't we just retreat to our nicely guarded gated communities guarded by robots? is going to increase more and more. Now I do think that human agency here is possible. I do think that if early enough we respond to all of this with sensible programs of economic redistribution we can actually save democracy. And this is what Andrew Keen is saying. He's saying You know what? It's fine. We're going to fix it somehow. Well, how is our response to climate change going? How is our response to automation globalization going so far? My fear is that on the right of a political spectrum people will just say What we have to do to get more jobs is to slash corporate tax and get rid of regulation and somehow the jobs are going to come back up. And what you might get on the left of a political spectrum is a bunch of promises about jobs guarantees and coming up with a bunch of fake jobs which have actually been automated away. Our ability to respond to this fundamental transformation in the economy if general intelligence does occur is very limited. And that's why it's not foreordained but quite likely that automation on that scale would indeed crash democracy."

    "data": "Thank you, John. And thank you, Yascha, for starting to lay out my argument for me. That was  that was very kind of you. So, I will give you this much. We are at the brink of the fourth industrial revolution. Some economic restructuring as we've seen in the past and we have periods of technological change is inevitable. And yes, it's inevitable that some jobs currently performed by humans will be frankly better performed by machines. But what's not inevitable in any way as Yascha says in his book, history is not linear. You know, we thought that we were all heading towards the end of history back in 1989. End of History, Fukuyama. And we're not at the end of history, right? So, we always tend to project from our current moment into the future. And frankly that's not how history works. So, the nightmare scenario what we have this deep inequality, the haves and have nots, robots are our overlords and we just tend to them, and this is the reality that, you know, our children and our children's children will face is not inevitable in any way. But how do we avoid the nightmare? Because it is a possibility, right? It is a possibility. Well, we avoid it exactly by not giving in to the fears and anxieties that are very human. If we turn away from the coming technological revolution, because it is coming at us like all technological revolutions have, democracies will be left in the dark. And we will give the space to authoritarian regimes like Russia and China to lead in this  in this dimension. But if we resist that fear and we embrace technological change and we face it as a nation, as a people, as governments, as citizens then a new future is indeed possible. And as Ian says in his book, and I quote, history of personal experience shows that people give their best when the best is required of them. And that is indeed true. And that has been true for the  since the end  since the beginning of time. So just as we have smartphones and smarthomes we need to think about how do we have smart democracies? Because democratic systems can be more dynamic and are by design more flexible and adaptable to rapid change. Authoritarian regimes are not. Think about Russia and China, right? These are regimes that suppress dissent, that censor free speech online. These are the actions of very nervous, anxious societies that are fearful of the coming change. This is not what democracies are built on. Democracies are built on openness, plurality, resilience. And guess what? We have a huge comparative advantage here. We have the advantage that only in democracies can citizens mobilize, activate, and push their political leaders to get through the kinds of social policies that will make this difficult and challenging adjustment period much more smoother and much easier. Look back at history. Beginning of 20th century the United States went through a huge technological upheaval, right? And at the same time did we fall down on our knees? No. We survived, and we actually thrived. Right after that time the United States became the top economic power. It wrote the rules of the international order. And we became a much more inclusive universal society over the same time period. So, we have the handbook. We know how to get through the next technological revolution and we can, and we will do it again. And you know what? New technology is actually making it a lot easier, not harder. Think about the Parkland students from Florida just recently. Look at what they were able to achieve in a matter of weeks. This would have taken years in the past. Think about how much more and faster we could have gotten the civil rights movement and the women's rights movement if Facebook and Twitter existed in 1960s. Probably a lot further. So smart democracies will be those democracies that can combine the mass economic efficiencies and benefits that automation will offer inevitably with economic security for its citizens. And, you know, to be frank a postautomation society sounds pretty good, right? Humans evolved to be complex thinking machines. We did not evolve to hammer the same widget a thousand times, over and over again, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Machines can do that for me. I'm fine with that, right? We will be liberated when we have machines doing these rote manual tasks for us. We will be able to actually fulfill our human potential and creativity, which we all inherently have. And it's not going to be about us versus them, as the title of Ian's book suggests. It's going to be us and them. It's about intelligence augmentation. So, IA versus artificial intelligence being the enemy  or AI. Right? And you know, Andrew and I, we're not naive. We're not looking at the world through these rosecolored glasses. We are just people who refuse to give into fearmongering when we don't actually know what the future holds. We refuse to give into paranoia. We're pragmatic realists, and we can look at the past and see that we have dealt with similar challenges before, and we can do it again. So, refuse with us. Vote no. Thank you."

    "data": "Good evening. When I was first told that I would have an opportunity to be a part of this debate and that my motion would be that Negotiations Can Denuclearize, I said, Of course. Of course. Why not? But then I said, Let me step back a bit and say a little bit about why I have that perception. I have spent my life working in the area of nuclear nonproliferation, chemical, biological, nonproliferation arms control. So, I spent my life sitting at the table with others negotiating treaties, working with the delegations, drafting treaty texts, and really making the what may seem impossible possible. Sitting at the table finding out ways in which we can find common interests to find a way and a process for agreement. So, I have been in a world of the possible. I've also done some research on this. Actually, my topic for my dissertation was why do countries decide that they want to or not develop nuclear weapons? And how does nonproliferation actions really play a role in their decisions, that decision making? And I have found out in all of the research that a very important part of this is the leader and what the leader wants to do. And when a leader decides that it's ready, that their country's ready to give up a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapon program, then they're ready to sit at the table and talk. And we have examples of countries giving up nuclear weapons or giving up nuclear weapons programs. We have Argentina and Brazil. We have Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. We have South Africa. All of these countries decided at some point that they wanted to give up their nuclear weapons or their nuclear weapons program. And at some point, a leader made the decision that that as the right thing to do. We have Iran. We all know about the Iran agreement. That was also an agreement that many said could not happen. That was an agreement that many said, We'll never get to an agreement with Iran for them to stop their nuclear weapons program. But there were fortunately some that believed that it was possible. And as a result, after many months, we have the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Agreement. So, it can happen, and it did happen. And there's no reason why it cannot happen again. Of course, we do have one wrinkle. It's North Korea. And the problem is, we have a history. We have a history with North Korea, where there have been agreements and those agreements didn't work. However, we're not saying that you should not take account of these things. In fact, when you're going into a negotiation, you should take into account the past. And as you prepare yourself for the positions you're going to take, you should take those things into consideration, and that will help you decide how you're going to negotiate and what you're going to try to get from the other side. However, those are not reasons not to negotiate, and it's not reason to think that you cannot reach a conclusion. You can never give up on diplomacy. You can never give up on trying to reach a conclusion with another side. And what is the options? Do we want to go back to where we were? It wasn't that long ago. Do you want to go back to the point where there was a lot of insecurity, where two countries with nuclear weapons were facing each other, where there was a lot of rhetoric outside, where there was a lot of things being said? That's not a situation we want. We want to be at a point now, after all the saberrattling, after all the words, to finally say, Okay, let's sit down and talk, because we think we can make a difference now. And the table is set. We have all these negotiations. We have the meetings between North Korea and South Korea. We had the meetings with North Korea and China. We have the upcoming meeting with the U.S. and North Korea. Why would these be happening if we didn't think it's possible? What's the point of doing all of this if we can't have denuclearization? So, the table is set. The time is right. We've had our saberrattling. We've had everyone do their thing with the  you know, We're going to threaten you with this and threaten you with that. Okay, now, let's step back and let's do what we need to do to make sure that we can come to some decisions and some agreements on denuclearization. Understanding the past is important, but it should not prevent you from making progress in the future. And for that reason, I know that you all will vote for the motion, that negotiation can lead to denuclearization of North Korea. Thank you."

    "data": "There is no bargain that can fully denuclearize North Korea at the negotiating table. That is what we are arguing tonight. If our opponents can convince you of the opposite  that there is a clear deal that Kim Jong Un would prefer over his now complete nuclear arsenal  than you should vote for this motion and against our position. But throughout this debate this evening, we ask you to keep in mind one critical definition, and that is the definition of denuclearization. Denuclearization is the complete, verifiable, irreversible disarmament of North Korea and its nuclear weapons program, as defined by policymakers and the Trump administration itself. And that is the heart of what we are debating tonight. In the time I have remaining, I want to make three brief points. The first is that North Korea believes it needs nuclear weapons to survive. The second is that the United States does not have a reasonable substitute it can offer North Korea. And the third is that by chasing a denuclearization pipe dream, we put ourselves at considerable risk. First, North Korea believes it needs nuclear weapons to survive. The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, and tens of thousands of American troops still on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea invested in its conventional military, arraying artillery all along the Demilitarized Zone to ensure that South Korea and the United States could not invade it to topple the regime. Since the 1980s, it's had an active and secretive nuclear weapons program, and it first tested a nuclear weapon in 2006. It's now had nuclear weapons for over 10 years, and it sought them in order to add nuclear deterrence to the conventional deterrence it already possessed, to ensure that it would never be invaded and that the regime could survive. Since coming to power, Kim Jung Un has invested more in his nuclear programs and his missile program than his father or his grandfather before him and in the last few months has finally declared them complete and North Korea's survival assured. For North Korea nuclear weapons are existential. They're a matter of survival and they are something that are now guaranteed. So, what could the United States possibly offer up in exchange? Well, it could offer North Korea logically a security guarantee, a promise that it would never be invaded and that the regime would never be toppled. Sounds like a pretty good thing to offer, but the only problem is we've offered it countless times before and we've always been rejected. Take, for example, a 2005 agreement by which North Korea agreed to denuclearize completely in exchange for a public U.S. promise of a security guarantee. That North Korea then violated. In private, North Korean nuclear negotiators repeatedly tell their American counterparts that U.S. security guarantees can't be trusted. They point to examples of the United States invading Iraq or invading Libya, having disarmed their opponent and then invaded those countries to topple the regime and show those as reasons why our security guarantees cannot be trusted. Why would they accept now what they have never accepted in the past? Now that their nuclear arsenal and weapons program is complete. Third and finally, by chasing this denuclearization pipe dream, we risk missing the diplomatic opportunity at hand and courting catastrophic conflict. We cannot buy what is not for sale and North Korea is not selling its full nuclear weapons program right now, but by continuing to chase that goal we allow North Korea to keep building nuclear weapons. What we can do is do much better than we've done in the past and that means pursuing realistic goals towards obtainable ends. Arms control that will return weapons inspectors to the country and get a handle on these programs. Working with our allies to contain and deter North Korea and prevent it from spreading the world's most dangerous weapons. But if we chase a promise that Kim Jong Un has not made and does not intend to keep we face two very real risks. The first is that we make real concessions in exchange for a promise that is not real at all and miss this diplomatic opportunity. But the second and worst still is that when the Trump administration awakens from its denuclearization dream it takes us to the world of our worst nightmares. It returns to a world in which it is considering a war on the Korean peninsula. Something that was all too real just a few months ago. Finally, I want to conclude by being clear about what we're not arguing tonight. We are not in favor of the use of force. We are in favor of diplomacy towards realistic and obtainable goals. We ask you to vote for smart diplomacy towards meaningful ends and to vote against this motion tonight."

    "data": "Good evening everyone. I'm so happy to be here. As we saw at the historic inter Korean summit, Kim Jung Un told South Korea's president, Moon Jaein, that he was ready to give up his nuclear weapons in exchange for the United States ending the Korean war formally and promising not to invade their country. The two leaders signs a joint declaration that called for a nuclearfree Korean peninsula and complete denuclearization. That was their common goals. This turn to diplomacy is most welcome, especially when you consider just months ago we were on the verge of war with North Korea. Of course, we've seen similar language in previous agreements and in previous failed attempts, but that should not stop us from pursuing what I think is the biggest opportunity for diplomacy with North Korea in almost 20 years. I understand the skepticism. In fact, I share it, but we shouldn't let the past failures get in the way of us trying again. So, when considering this evening's motion, I think there are three key questions we should explore. The first one is, is Kim Jong Un ready to come in from the cold. We've seen more of Kim Jong Un these past few weeks  and heard more  than we have during his entire sixyear tenure as North Korea's leader. My best assessment of what's behind this unprecedented outreach is that he understands he needs to do this in order to gain acceptance of a new strategic policy you just put forward. This is the policy of economic reconstruction. In my informal conversations with North Korean senior officials, they have explained that they do not want to amass a humongous nuclear arsenal; they want just enough to deter an attack by the United States, and then turn their attention to economic development. This follows Kim Jong Un's Byunjin [spelled phonetically] line, and that's a national policy that has, on one track, the development of the nuclear program, and on the other track economic development. Of course, what we have seen over these years is Kim Jong Un pursuing relentlessly advancements in his nuclear program, at great cost to the well being of the North Korean people. 2017 was a pivotal year for Kim Jong Un. That is when he declared the completion of his nuclear force in November, and then reiterated it again in his New Year's speech, just this past January. And this leads me to my second question: why now? The North Koreans say they now have a deterrent to deter an attack from the United States, which enables them to come back to the negotiating table as an equal to the United States, as a nuclear power. And let's not forget: Kim Jong Un is not his father. He's not his grandfather. He's 34 years old. He sees decades of rule ahead of him. And he understands  he must understand that he'll  that in order to maintain the Kim family dynasty, he's got to do something to address the economic conditions in North Korea. And there's only one way to do that, and that's to lift the sanctions. The third and final question is, how can we get to a successful outcome? And that's the most important question. I think we need to rigorously test whether Kim is serious about giving up his nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees and economic development. And to increase the chances for a successful outcome, we should be thinking boldly. We should be thinking of what kind of comprehensive package we're going to offer Kim. Peace treaty, normalization of relations. Security guarantees that of course would have to include Beijing. On the economic side  we need to be thinking, in addition to the relief of economic sanctions, we need to be thinking about investment, trade, economic aid. As a senior advisor recently put it to  said  senior advisor to President Moon said, what the North Koreans want is a Trump Tower and McDonalds. So, surely Kim Jong Un knows what it will take to get there. So, I'd like to wrap up by saying that the wording of tonight's motion is particularly important; negotiations can denuclearize North Korea. The operative word is can, which points to possibility. If the motion was negotiations could denuclearize  will denuclearize North Korea, I wouldn't be up here to defend that  because the simple fact is, we don't know if that will be the outcome. So, can made all the difference to me. It's possible. So, please keep that in mind when you cast your vote in favor of this motion. And the way I look at it is a vote in favor of this motion is a vote in support of diplomacy. Thank you."

So, as a child growing up in South Korea, and as an adult who spent almost all of my career following the North Korean issues, I have to say, when I saw the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, actually cross over the Demilitarized Zone and step foot in South Korea, it was a moving moment. You know, I got a little bit emotional. It was moving. It was momentous. It was historic. So, and I'm happy that we are now on this path of trying to sort something out, particularly since several months ago I was having sleepless nights because I was so concerned about all this talk of preventive military strike against North Korea. That would have had catastrophic consequences not only for the Korean peninsula, but for the region and for the world. That said, ladies and gentlemen, can negotiations lead to denuclearization? That's complete irreversible, verifiable. I do not think so. I think negotiations will lead to in another agreement with North Korea. Sure. There will be an agreement between Kim and Trump. There's always an agreement. We have many agreements with North Korea. Every single time it fell apart over verification. We have 1994 agreed framework, bilateral agreement between United States and North Korea. We have 1999 Geneva Accords in which North Korea agreed to stop all its longrange testing missile testing. We have six rounds of sixparty talks, which led to 2005 joint statement, 2007 joint declaration in which North Korea also agreed to show  declare all of its nuclear weapons and disable all of its existing nuclear facilities. But we have not every single time agreement fell apart over verification. So, I don't believe negotiations will lead to complete verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea. What have Kim Jong Un been doing since coming into power? Six and a half years he's done four out of six nuclear tests, including hydrogen bomb test that was 17 times more powerful than the one that flattened Hiroshima. He did 90 ballistic missile tests in six and a half years, 20 last year alone. Three intercontinental ballistic missile tests. Last one the one in November 2015. That one showed a capability to reach all of the United States and North Korea has now declared itself a nuclear weapons power. So, this is what Kim Jong Un has been doing, speeding towards completing the nuclear program, accelerating towards it. And why? He has  because he like his father and grandfather, believe that nuclear weapons is only way to guarantee regime survival. He has, like his father and grandfather, has pursued this program at costs of millions of lives and billions of dollars to pursue this program. Now he's completed it, but now he's going to all of the sudden give it up. When every single time Suzanne meets with North Korea officials, I met with North Korean officials. Every single time and I'm sure they told Suzanne this, too. They talk about Iraq and Libya. They don't want to be another Iraq or another Libya. In the case of Libya we said  we convinced Qaddafi to give up his nuclear weapons program and then we backed and revolted and ended up overthrowing Qaddafi and killing him. How many times North Koreans have said Qaddafi's dead. I don't want to be dead. We don't want to be dead. This is the only way for us to survive. So, why did Kim Jong Un switch to the summitry and diplomacy? Well, there's a lot of things that he wants. He wants sanctions relief. He wants money, food, fuel to flow into pipelines. He wants diplomatic recognition. He wants international recognition as a nuclear weapons state. There were a lot of things that he wants, but it's not complete irreversible denuclearization of the North. Oftentimes, and I have to distinguish what does North Korea mean by denuclearization of the Korean peninsula? Because we  Suzanne brought this up. There was a peace declaration. There was a [unintelligible] declaration. What does North Koreans mean? North Koreans have historically meant by that denuclearization of the Korean peninsula if the regime security is guaranteed and that doesn't mean just the north unilateral disarmament. He's talking about also South Korea. He's talking about breaking U.S./South Korea alliance relationship, getting U.S. troops out of South Korea and ending extended nuclear umbrella the U.S. has over South Korea and Japan so the regime can feel secure. This is what he means by denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. There's a long way to go there and we're not going to get there. Please vote for the opposition side of the motion today."

    "data": "Well, thanks everybody for coming to this and thank you Intelligence Squared and the Adam Smith Society and our makeup girl who tried to make me look better. I wanted to say that this is sort of the perfect audience. It's a bunch of millennials and it's  this is all going to be in your hands. It's what happens to the world. Do we have a world that you kind of grew up in where you are deeply in debt. You are coming out with a bunch of facts that don't help you get employed, and you're coming into this world that this  your grandfather's Fiat world that's very controlled and constrained and you're saying what? Does this make any sense? And you have a major opportunity right now. All of the sudden this amazing thing happened. Sitoshi Nakamoto [spelled phonetically] came up with a new kind of currency and now let me take you through a history of currencies. We used to use shells and we'd carry around shells, but then they got too bulky and then we moved to gold and then gold got too bulky and we kind of ran out of it and then it was the promise of gold or the promise of silver, and that was like a silver certificate. And then it was like the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and that's the federal reserve note. And you're looking at it and you're kind of going okay, well what is this? It's just paper. And they say the full credit of the U.S. government. There was a huge debate much like this, huge battle about should we go off the gold standard and people said no, it's just paper. We can't do that. We have to be on the gold standard because gold is really what this country is built on. And but paper, it just sort of abstracted things and then it got further abstracted. Currency, what did currency become? And all of the sudden there's this currency. It's awesome. Because we have like the federal reserve note, you are relying on a third party to hold your currency, right? You rely on a bank. I  whenever you walk down a street of a city look at the biggest buildings in the world. They're all banks. That's your money that's gone into their buildings. Think about it. I mean, when you go to Las Vegas it's like, you know, why are all these beautiful buildings here? Well, it was your money. It's the same idea. So now you've got this new currency and your trusted third party is 100,000 computers that are all focused on making sure that every single transaction is done perfectly. So, it  now do you think that humans are going to make sure that every single transaction is done perfectly? I've had 15 times where a bank statement was wrong. In fact, the bank actually gave me $2,000,000 at one point just here. It was there in my statement. I had to call them, talk to 15 people, figure out where that  why I had this extra $2,000,000 and why and, you know, to give it back I had to go through about 15 people. So, in this case you've got a new currency and it's virtual and it's something that transcends geographic borders. So, you don't have to be reliant on your country. I had this great guy who came up to me and he said, his name is Sebastian Serrano [spelled phonetically], and he said, You know, I lived in Argentina all my life and my family fortune disappeared three times and I'm only 30 years old and it's just disappeared to currency manipulation. And, you know, as you know the Argentinian peso has dropped 30 percent a year. Same thing with Nigerian Nira [spelled phonetically] or whatever. Anyway, Sebastian said, I'm going to start this business and I'm going to build it all on bitcoin. And he did and it was  and it's an enormous success. He has since created a new currency called Ribio [spelled phonetically] and it's one of the top currencies of the world, cryptocurrencies of the world. Now people ask things like is it a bubble. I  the whole premise of is it a bubble is ridiculous because our last bubble, what was that? The internet bubble. Was that a bubble? You guys still use the internet. I see some of you actually using it right now. That was no bubble. That was an amazing transformation of our world. It affected many different industries. It affected information, communications, banking. It affected  well, it didn't really affect banking. Banking had a way of kind of slipping through. It affected gaming. All sorts of things were affected by the internet. Cars  or taxis. So, now we've got another currency that has the ability to change enormous industries and it will change  it can change banking, insurance, real estate, and government itself."

    "data": "Thanks very much. I'm going to start with a quotation. When the profits of trade happen to be greater than ordinary, overtrading becomes a general error. And I assume you're all familiar with that quotation. It's from The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. He was talking about the great South Sea bubble of 1711 to 1720. Adam Smith, the great theorist of the free market, was also a keen observer of the world around him. He understood that bubbles occurred and they existed. The South Sea bubble, which was kind of a speculative mania in the stock of a company that was supposed to invest in South America destroyed many fortunes, damaged the British economy significantly and continued to reverberate up until through the rest of the 18th Century when Smith was writing The Wealth of Nations. Now what exactly is a bubble? Many people are skeptical despite the long historical record of bubbles culminating in the most recent bubble in your lifetime, the real estate bubble of the early 2000s, which led to the financial crisis and the great recession. A bubble occurs when the price of an asset deviates from its underlying value and the deviation is maintained for a significant amount of time. And the question is why does this occur? Isn't the market price supposed to reflect the actual value? And the explanation is complicated. Usually there's some kind of accident, sometimes a new technology. That's what happened in 1711. People get excited. The early movers make big profits. Everybody else sees this and they think well that's easy. They just bought this thing. We can do the same. As people chase their tails or their neighbors trying to get rich, the price spikes. Now, the price can go up in an asset just because that asset is very useful and so we have this pattern already of the prices of bitcoin going up and then down a little bit. And the question is, does that reflect the bubble mentality, the speculative mania, or something real? So, what I want to do in this opening statement is just to give you three reasons to think that a bubble is taking place now. And the key idea I want to convey with you is that the very elements of bitcoin that its supporters cite as support for their view that bitcoin is this great new thing, is also the greatest vulnerability for bitcoin. So first, anonymity. Okay? So, bitcoin transactions are anonymous or more accurately pseudonymous. People use codes that are difficult to trace back to them. And this of course is attractive. People want to keep their financial transactions private. Two problems with this. The people to whom this is most attractive is criminals. That's why there's a great deal of criminal activity in the bitcoin market. Bitcoins are very good for money launderers, drug criminals, human traffickers, and many other criminals. And then there's another problem, which is that bitcoin is only anonymous for very sophisticated people, sophisticated criminals, especially. Ordinary people can't master the technology. And as a result, ordinary people have come to rely on intermediary institutions, a bit like banks. Wallet companies, for example, exchanges, and you don't get anonymity with those companies. Those companies typically insist on the identity of their customers. So ordinary people don't really get anonymity ultimately if the government believes that they're engaged in criminal transactions. Sophisticated people, sophisticated business people, and criminals do. Second feature of bitcoin, the fixed money supply. There can never be more than 21 million bitcoins because of the way that the program was designed. This is said to be good because national currencies sometimes are subject to inflation, which can be a nuisance and in extreme cases a terrible  cause terrible problems. The problem, though, is the fixed money supply is no good either. Fixed money supply leads to deflation, which is just as bad as inflation. People will hoard the currency as they are with bitcoin because they believe they'll be able to buy more goods and services in the future. A currency that is not used is dysfunctional. Bitcoin can't be successful as long as there's a limited money supply. But even more important than that, government's control of the money supply is absolutely essential for addressing financial crises like the one we lived through in 2008 and addressing recessions like the one we lived through in the years after the financial crisis. If the money supply is truly fixed the government is helpless. Back when the United States was on the gold standard in the 19th Century, there was an endless cycle of speculative manias, crashes, and terrible depressions, far worse than anything we've experienced since the great depression. Now this leads to a third point, which is in fact the money supply is not really fixed. That's actually a bit of a myth and it's connected to the third element of bitcoin that its supporters cite, which is the decentralization. The idea that nobody controls it and so we don't have to worry about manipulation. Okay, now that is false and it's important to understood  understand that that's false. It's true that bitcoin isn't like the dollar, which is controlled by the central bank, a bunch of political appointees, but it is controlled by the bitcoin miners, the socalled miners, the people who create bitcoins as a part of the transaction confirmation function that they serve in this currency network. It turns out that a very small number of people own the vast majority of bitcoins and the way that it works is when the Bitcoin protocol needs to be changed  and that has to happen, and it has happened several times  it's the Bitcoin miners  the people with 51 percent of the computing power  who determine that. Who are they? We don't know. Probably a lot of foreigners, possibly foreign governments. I'll have another Adam Smith quote for you, but I'm out of time. So, I'll just say Bitcoin is a bubble. Vote no on the motion. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Bitcoin is more than a bubble. It is here to stay. You should vote yes. Here is why. First of all, for 6,000 years, humans who engage in consensual exchange have had to go about it one way. Well, we have this trouble of  this problem of trust. How do we solve trust? I'm trading you a camel for your gold coin. How do I trust that you debase the coin or not? So, we  there are people who create business models  in that case, a mint. The guy who has a monopoly on violence in an area creates a mint, puts his face on the coin; says, If you debase this, I kill you. That's a business model  the way to monetize his monopoly on violence. There's lots of business models. But that enables us to engage in our trade. Lots of business models  lots of institutions, I should say, have that same feature. Land titling, for one thing. Visa cards, for another. If you come into my store, I don't know you. You don't know if you can trust me. I don't know if I can trust you. We each just trust Visa just like we each just trust the land titling office or we each just trust the mint. So, for 6,000 years, that's the way we've been going about solving things. We create these central institutions that  since we can't trust each other, we just trust them. For the first time in 6,000 years, we can have consensual exchange among strangers that is trustworthy. In other words, we have a way to do something that for 6,000 years humans have done by creating these institutions. We can now  and those institutions have accumulated, like barnacles on the hull of civilization. Some of them are private corporations. Some of them are functions of government. But remember, we  you know, they didn't come out of a burning bush. We created them, so we can go about achieving our ends. It's now possible to achieve those functions without those institutions. And we can see  we will see many of them  this is why Tim is correct. This is  I heard somebody snicker when he said, This is bigger than the Internet. It's much bigger than the Internet. The Internet disrupted publishing. I've been in a Silicon Valley company where there's 160 institutions on the wall. By institutions, I mean everything from notary publics to Wall Street, to many of the functions of lawyers and judges  can all be reduced to smart contracts and such. So, our  so, we will not have to rely on those central institutions nearly as much, going forward. Here's a big one that's really important to us, and I'm going to  here's a big one that's really important. I  some of the oldtimers here may remember the Soviet Union. And there was this country that tried to run itself, setting prices  23 million prices on 23 million things. The screws on this stand would have been sent by some bureaucrat in Moscow in a big ledger book  and such, eventually on computers. And we think that's ridiculous. See how silly these people were to try to run a society with them setting prices on 23 million things? But here in our society, what's the single most price  what's the single most important price any society faces? It's the price at which we discount the future against the present, which is to say interest rates. And currently, those are  that price is being sent in a central department of Central Planning called the United States Federal Reserve. Now, my worthy opponent  Eric Posner  believes that we need government to manage that. What did he say? We need government that can  needs to address the money supply to manage the economy. People like this is  you have to  when you  I think of  there was a Great London School of Economics professor who has described certain people's mentalities  the economy is this big engine. And they're the workmen, with the baseball caps, and the coveralls, and the screwdriver. And only they know just how to finetune it, just how to get the carburetor right and such, and you got to  when you hear that, remember the Dilbert strip. The pointyhair manager in the corner, who always  He knows what's best. He's in the corner. He knows better than those people out in the cubicles do. He knows what's best. You know, what could possibly go wrong? Every day he's got a different solution to something. And that is the mentality of the people who think that we need government to do all these things for us. They need to manage our money supply for us. Well, here's a different way to think of it  how we used to think of it. We have to communicate with each other information about value and scarcity. That's what a price is. It's a packet of information about value and scarcity so we can all communicate to each other. We want a form of money that we can communicate that information to each other without having to go through some field  some form by which we send that signal, through some field that any government mandarin controls. Then we can really communicate the truth to each other. The mandarins want to have their hands on the dial to be able to adjust that field and distort that signal to serve their own private political ends. That's why they're against Bitcoin. They don't want a form of monies that mandarins can't control it. And regarding that point, you know, we have seen in the last financial crisis that the oligarchs  they have bought themselves some senators. They bought themselves congressmen. They bought themselves the esteemed regulators to whom Mr. Posner bows. They bought themselves all kinds of things. One thing that they can't buy is the laws of mathematics. They can't buy the mathematics that underlies cryptography, which is why we should rebuild our social institutions on crypto  and in particular, Bitcoin. Thank you."

    "data": "Well, thank you. Well, I come last, but not least, to tell you why you should vote against this motion. And I tell you that not because I am an esteemed professor of law and finance  like Professor Posner  but because I am both a journalist and trained as a cultural anthropologist. And as an anthropologist, I can tell you three things about money. Firstly, that societies all over the world have used all kinds of things to create money over history. There is nothing special about fiat currency. Secondly, fiat currency has problems, as you've heard. I will admit that. But thirdly, and this is a key point  the problems with fiat currency today are nothing compared to the problems with Bitcoin. And to understand that, you have to go back for a moment and think about first principles and think about what money does. Because, if you believe that Bitcoin is so valuable, you have to believe it's a fantastic type of money. So, what does money do? Well, as you all know, it's, one, a medium of exchange; two, a store of value. And sometimes, three, an investment too. So, think about it. Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, compared to fiat currency. Well, I don't know how many of you in the room have actually got Bitcoin, but any of you who have got Bitcoin will know it's a pretty lousy medium of exchange right now. You can't actually do very much with it. Yes, you can buy stuff on Overstock, and I've given you a free promotion, Patrick. Thank you. I work on commission. But not in Bitcoin.But right now, the system can only process seven transactions a second. That is nothing compared to the amount you actually need to make it a viable medium of exchange. It's slow. It's clunky. It's expensive. There ain't that many places you can actually use it. I mean, some of you may have seen the great New York Time piece recently, about trying to use Bitcoin in New York. And guess what? It's tough. Not a great medium of exchange. The other problem, of course, is its value has fluctuated dramatically. So, you might say, Well, what about store of value? Well, if you think it's a great store of value, you have to say, What is underpinning that store of value? And as Patrick says, trust underpins money. The roots of the word credit come from gredere, meaning Latin to believe. So, what underpins Bitcoin? It ain't trust in government. It's trust in, one, computers. Those wonderful, reliable, 100,000 computers that never break down, never get hacked, never have any kind of viruses. Are you guys ready to trust in computers forever? You trust in the wisdom of crowds. You trust in this idea there's always going to be roaring demand for Bitcoin. Well, maybe. As you just heard before, from Professor Posner, bubbles, manias come and go. Last, but not least, you trust in the fact that the supply is limited. Well, yes. Right now, those wonderful magicians of cryptography have created a system which has a limited supply of Bitcoins. But what about Ephyrium [spelled phonetically]? What about Bitcoin cash? What about all those other Bitcoins that are coming out too? Who actually believes that the first [unintelligible] of Bitcoin is going to be the only Bitcoin? I mean, remember a time we all thought that Sony Walkmans were the coolest thing out? I mean, you're probably too young for that. But think about it. Who actually thinks that Bitcoin is going to be the only idea like that? Why couldn't there be 20,000 more Bitcoins? In which case, what is that going to do to the value? Then you might say, Well, you know what? Yeah, we see all those problems with Bitcoin. But actually, fiat currency, that's even worse. Those governments, they cannot be trusted. To which I say this: okay. Maybe you don't like fiat currency. Maybe you think there are problems with government; you don't like institutions. Yes, I hear you. But what about this? There is actually something else out there which has been around for thousands of years, that doesn't require actually betting on a computer. Doesn't require betting that, somehow, the first mover, the first innovation on Bitcoin is going to last. There is something out there which is completely portable  something out there which doesn't require enormous amounts of electricity. And let's not forget the fact that to create one Bitcoin requires the energy usage of the typical American household over two years. Last year, Bitcoin mining took up all the electricity consumption equivalent to Denmark. Next year it will be Argentina. But there's something else out there that doesn't need that. And it's terribly simple. It's called gold. So, if you don't like Bitcoin  I'm sorry; if you don't like fiat currency, okay, fine. I happen to think it's not so bad  not ideal, not so bad  but if you don't like fiat currency, go buy gold  because Bitcoin  AKA digital gold  is a pretty lousy alternative. And the great thing about gold is that if it all goes horribly wrong, you can always wear it. You can put it in your teeth. So, vote against the motion."

    "data": "Thank you. So, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and we're here to urge you to support the proposition for three simple and straightforward reasons. Number one: The internet is the most powerful and pervasive platform on the planet. It does everything from deliver the world's knowledge to allow us to get a pizza delivered. It has changed our economy; it has changed the way we live each of our lives. But  second point  when we go to access the internet, the company that provides that service is typically a local monopoly. When we were doing our rulemaking, we found that three quarters of American households had at most one choice when it came to highspeed broadband internet connectivity. And that leads to the third point. You've got a very important and crucial asset in the internet. The access to it is not competitive; therefore, there needs to be rules. And the question is who makes the rules? Now, the network providers say, Trust us, we'll make the rules, but I think what we'll find in the discussion tonight is that history does not substantiate that trust. You know, Michael was talking about the age of the internet. It's actually about 35 years old. And for the first 25 years, net neutrality reigned, because we all remember the squeaky, screeching modems that you had to plug into your phone jack in your house to connect your computer to the telephone network to get to the internet. Well, that telephone network was a common carrier, and that meant that it had to take whoever came to it and deliver them to their destination. That's an important point that we'll talk a lot about tonight, this concept of common carrier which says, First come, first serve nondiscriminatory access. And it's only been in the last eight or 10 years that this whole debate about net neutrality has developed, because when the new digital networks came along, those who own those networks said, Oh, wait a minute. This is different. This is  this is different, and it needs to regulated differently. And the FCC, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, tried to work its way through that. Let me give you an example. 2007, under a Republican FCC, Comcast decided to degrade the video coming in over the Internet that competed with their cable service. The FCC said, No, no, no, no. The Republican FCC said, No, no, no. Comcast took them to court and said to the court, Hey, we can discriminate because we're not a common carrier. And the court said, You're right, and overruled the FCC. In 2010, when my predecessor came out with the first open Internet rule, Verizon sued, went to the court, and stood in the well of the court. And the lawyer said to the judges, I have been instructed by my client that I may say that the reason why we are suing is we intend to discriminate, and there is the key issue in all of this. Should these local companies be allowed to discriminate in access to the most important network of the 21st century? I had the privilege, as John said, of chairing the FCC in 2015 when we said, No. It should be  you should be a common carrier and you should provide nondiscriminatory access to anyone who wants to get to or from the Internet. And that's what the debate is about tonight because my worthy opponents want us to go back to the bad old days of discrimination. And what we need to be focusing on is a nondiscriminatory equal access to the network. One quick closing thought; last week we saw a lot of discussion about how much information Facebook has about each of us. Facebook is one website. The network that connects you to the Internet knows your traffic to every website. Your private information is known by the network and, unless there is common carriage net neutrality, there is no responsibility that they have to protect your privacy. So, because of the fact that we don't have a competitive market, because of the fact that history says it worked early on and discrimination happened when it didn't exist, and because of the fact that your privacy ought to be protected, we urge you to strongly and enthusiastically support this resolution tonight. Thank you."

    "data": "Thanks. Thank you very much. Wow, you know, Tom  well, vote against net neutrality, and the reason why is because  you remember the Patriot Act, right? The Patriot Act, who could be against the Patriot Act? It's for Patriots. It's good, it's good. Net neutrality is good. It's  you know, everybody's neutral, everybody's fair, that's great. We are not so dumb as to think that laws and policies  their names almost always mean the exact opposite thing. And what net neutrality has ultimately been, and I'll go into this in a little bit more detail, and Michael will really drive it home because he's the economist. I don't do math, unfortunately. But, you know, what net neutrality is about is about the government being able to say, We get to control your business model. Tom was talking about common carriers. I see a lot of young people out here. I see acres of diamonds out here. I see some old people. How many remember the great common carrier bell telephone? Okay, a number of you. That's not  that's the past. That's the preInternet past, and when you have common carrier, you get bad service. Do people remember Lily Tomlin, the comedian? She  one of her big bits was that she would be a phone service operator and she would say, We don't have to give you customer service because we're the phone company and we don't want to. That's the world of common carrier, as it is historically done. But to go into my prepared remarks, you know, first I want to thank John and IQsquared for having me back. The first time that I debated in one of these, all I had to do was defend drug dealers  heroin dealers who wanted to put vending machines in grammar schools, things like that. And now it's like they've really made it much harder for me, because somehow I'm going to  I have to support ISPs. Do any of you love your ISPs? No. Right? I mean, we all hate these types of people. They're necessary evils. But they are businesses, and our lives are better because of the Internet, and they are not the problem here. And net neutrality is  in the word of Ajit Pai  the policy of it, not the concept  the policy  Ajit Pai actually told me in an interview in 2014 that it's a solution that won't work to a problem that doesn't exist. And I want to just kind of unpack that in my opening statement. It's  let's look at, first, at how it's a problem that doesn't exist. How many of you have had major troubles or persistent troubles with accessing any legal content online? Okay. Nobody, right? That's one of  you know, if that would happen, you know, that would be a violation of net neutrality. We have a before, during, and after sequence now, because the open Internet ruling that Tom put into place was in place for two years. We had time before it, during it, and after it. Have you noticed massive changes, other than constantly increasing speeds, in what you can you do online? No. Net neutrality is a concept. It is not a problem. There  back in 2004, 2005, Michael Powell, a former FCC commissioner, said, you know, there are basically four freedoms or four rights that define a kind of good Internet, an open Internet. And they were, among other things  one was the right to access legal content. You have the freedom  the right to access legal content. You have the right to access applications that don't  applications online that don't hurt the network, or to put them online. You have the right to attach devices to the network  you know, phone  cameras, all sorts of stuff  which, by the way, going back to common carrier, that was one of the things; Bell Telephone never let anybody attach anything to the network because it was common carrier. They got to  you know, it was a government monopoly, a governmentsupported monopoly. They got to call all the shots. We have the right to attach devices to the network, and we have the right to get information on our plan. We should be able to talk to our ISPs and say, you know, What's going on? Are you blocking certain sites? Are you changing things up? Are you not allowing me? Why are my expected speeds going up and down? Contrary to what Tom said, 98 percent of Americans, according to the FCC's own data  from the end of 2016  they  98 percent of us have a choice of at least two ISPs offering 10megabyte download speed. That's not great, but it's pretty good. 56 percent of us  and it's more than enough for virtually everything most of us do, unless you're doing some unauthorized surgery. And if you are, I'm a libertarian, so more power to you. But you probably want to upgrade to a better package. 56 percent of us have download speeds of 25 megabytes or higher, with more than two competing ISPs working for your business. That's very good. And that's up from 40 percent six months before. What we are seeing are more ISPs offering more service to more households at higher speeds. There is not a problem with net neutrality. There is not a problem with throttling or blocking sites. So, there isn't a problem. But  well, the solutions to this problem that don't exist  this is why they don't work. In the end, what net neutrality comes down to is the FCC says, Under certain types of regulatory laws, we get to regulate your business model. We're not going to tell you whether you're right or wrong, but go ahead and try, and then we'll get back to you. That is an awful, awful way to regulate any kind of business. It chokes off all sorts of innovation. And it ends the sort of permissionless innovation, which is the absolute calling card both of the Internet as well as the sharing economy. I will stop there. Thanks, and again, vote against net neutrality if you believe in free speech, innovation, and a better America."

    "data": "Support net neutrality. It affects the internet and our lives in three ways. One, who decides and controls what we can see and do online. Two, who decides whether new products are successful and what direction innovation takes. Three, it decides the amount of discrimination and selfdealing that sits at the core of the network of everything we do. So, first, who decides what we see and can do online? When we click on a link or select an app, what happens? Do we get to see the site or the application we're aiming for, or is it suddenly not available? Without net neutrality, it does not need to be available to you. It's kind of odd to think that part of the internet might not be there, but that's part of the discussion we're talking about. That's called in the net neutrality world blocking. Or when you click on that link or select an app, maybe the site appears, but it's slow. It's really slow. Or the delivery of that information to you is so degraded that it's maybe even unusable; it's too jittery; it's too slow. The application doesn't work. That in the net neutrality world is called discrimination, and it is the point of what we're talking about. Now, an ISP  Comcast, Verizon, AT&T  you know, they can discriminate really on any reason. They can discriminate because they own a different product, and they think they'll make more money out of it. That's an innovative business model of the type we just heard about. It is only good for the ISP. Or the ISP could discriminate against the app that you want to access because they have some sort of business arrangement, or maybe they're fighting with a company that makes your app, or they could discriminate against the app you want to get to because they don't like those kinds of apps. You know, they weren’t very happy about internet telephony, because it didn't make money. Or they could discriminate because they don't like the content. Any of these things are included in the discrimination or the kinds of new business models that our opposition argues for. So, one, our choice as consumers and citizens on the internet get severely limited without net neutrality. Two, who decides what kind of innovation and new products can be successful? That's the reverse of the topic. Say I'm an app developer, and I'm developing something new. Let's say, you know, it's something that's more secure. There's new cryptographic data; I can help you do what you want with your data but leak less of it, so you control it more. Now, if the ISPs don't need to serve that to you, then I somehow have to find a way that I can make my product available to you. And as John said at the beginning, that way is through the ISP. There is no other way. So, before I can offer my product to you, I have to offer it to the ISPs, and I have to convince them or get their approval to deliver it to you, and to deliver it to you quickly enough to make it usable. So, now, as an app developer, my first customer is not you. My first customer is the ISP. Maybe it wants money; maybe I can find money and pay them. Maybe it wants data. Like, if the ISP doesn't like my product because competing products give them data, then my product is not good for them, and they can say, I'm not going to deliver it to customers. You know, if you change your data practices, maybe I will. And so, in that case, I, as that the developer, cannot make the product I want for you. I cannot make it more secure. And then I have to go to all the other ISPs and have the same discussion. So, the ability for innovation to cover a wide range is deeply limited. The lack of net neutrality is great for innovation for the ISPs  five companies; even 10 if you double it in America  and it is terrible for all the rest of us. And all the innovative business models that might come out of everyone except the ISPs get limited by what works for the ISPs. And the third question, how much discrimination do we want in the network that is the basis for all of our activities? So, Comcast owns NBC. That's a lot of content. The whole point of not having net neutrality is that the ISPs can have innovative business models that benefits the content they like and profit from. So, maybe if you're a Comcast subscriber, and that's your option, you'll start to see a lot of content that's good for Comcast. If you're an AT&T subscriber, they're trying to buy Time Warner, which includes CNN. So, maybe you'll start to get discrimination from AT&T with a different set of content. Or maybe Time Warner can't buy CNN because the government won't let it. Maybe it buys Sinclair News instead, and then if you live in a part of the country where there's AT&T as your choice, and AT&T is discriminating and trying innovative new business models with all the content that it owns, you may very well find your channels of information, including your news, tuned for the new business model that's profitable. Now, sometimes people say to me, Oh, that's crazy. You know, businesses wouldn't do that. But, you know, people told me that when I first started talking about the dangers of Facebook and data, and that was nearly a decade ago. And so, these sort of crazy businesses would never do that things have a way of happening. And so, we are setting the framework right now. It might take another decade for these things to play out and we see what it looks like to have discrimination built in, but we are making the rules now. Does the next decade play out with a neutral network that delivers information to us based on where we find value, or does this small set of companies get to preselect what we see? And so, I urge you. I hope you find the preciousness of neutrality in our infrastructure and take action. Support the motion. Support net neutrality. All data is created equal. Thank you."

    "data": "Well, you know, advocates of net neutrality are always telling us about the great things its intended to do, things like promote free speech and competition and innovation. But, although I vaguely remember when I first used the Internet, I still remember sitting on my grandmother's knee as a small baby, and she said to me  she goes, Michel, the information superhighway to hell is paved with good intentions. So, what I want to do is, instead of talking about intentions, I want to talk about the  what net neutrality really does, okay? Now, to do that, I got to start by dealing with three foundational myths behind net neutrality. Myth number one is it's necessary to solve problems that would otherwise be there. Now, Nick's already taken care of that one, so how about I deal with the other two? Okay, the second myth is that net neutrality is neutral, okay? One reason it's a myth is because different applications have different needs from the Internet. Video conferencing needs much higher speed signal and more reliable signal than something like email. So, to say we're going to treat them equally, it's not to treat them equally. It's a much bigger problem for video conferencing. Now, one thing you'll notice, because I sort of go a little bit in back, we were all told to stand on some Xs here. And I have tremendous respect for Tom, and I've worked with him over the years, but when he'd sit out in the middle, and he told you that the Internet in the good old days was neutral, he was both literally and figuratively off the mark, okay? Oh, and by the way, for those of you who are younger, literally means literally. Think about the logic. Okay, because the fact is the NSF net, the precursor to the commercial internet prioritized interactive traffic, as it should. Now, there's a second reason that net neutrality is not neutral. We always hear this thing, Oh, we need net neutrality because, otherwise, big powerful companies will have fast lanes. Well, you know what? They do and it has nothing  it's nothing net neutrality's going to stop. Google, Facebook, Amazon, they spend literally billions of dollars because they have built private fast lanes. Google has  or not Google, apologies. Facebook has proprietary specifications for fiber. They build their own integrated circuits because the servers other people would have to use aren't good enough. So, what does net neutrality have to do with this? Well, it ensures that ISPs can't help small firms have higher speed access. So, if you have billions to spend on an Internet of your own, net neutrality's a great thing, but if you need help, it's a problem. Now, the third myth is that all data are created equal. Now, I want to contrast two situations. In one, you've got a bunch of kids sitting around and they're playing Wolfenstein. Now, for those of you who are not up on your classic games, Wolfenstein is a multiplayer game that involves trying to kill Nazis with supernatural powers. The Nazis have the supernatural powers, not you, okay? So fine, you're using the Internet to do that. Over here, we've got a surgeon who's trying to do remote telesurgery to save somebody's life who lives in a remote area. The surgeon can't get there. According to net neutrality, those two are equally deserving, okay? I don't subscribe to that view, okay? All right. So, now, those are the myths it's built on. So, let's talk about some of the things it does. Well, you know, we've heard a lot concerns about censorship. Well, frankly, net neutrality is the threat to free speech. Just ask yourself this: who do you think is a bigger threat to access to CNN.com and WashingtonPost.com? Is it an ISP that makes money because you pay it because you want to get access to this site, or is it the Trump administration? Because what net neutrality is about is giving the Trump administration more power over the Internet that those websites depend on. Okay, let's talk about some other things it does. Competition. What you'll hear from net neutrality supporters is you've got to block competition to protect it. Yes. That is an oxymoron. Now, what do I mean by that? Because they said, Well, we can't have firms pay more money in order to bring better services to their customers. That would be terrible. Well, let's think about what net neutrality would mean in other circles. Let's think about, say, Amazon, or online providers. It would mean they can't provide free overnight shipping. Why? That's not fair. That's a fast lane. Or just think about any firm that wanted to do advertising, say, on Google or Facebook. Well, you can't allow that. That's paying for superior access to customers. We can't have people paying for superior access to customers. So, what net neutrality is really about when it comes to competition is blocking it. Okay? Not promoting it. Similarly, let's talk about low income consumers. People have said, Oh, we need to have net neutrality to protect people with low incomes. Well, it has the opposite effect. Net neutrality  right, well, if it's enforced, and sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't  when it's enforced, what does it do? It says, if a content provider, an app provider wants to help subsidize the Internet for low income people, [negative]. Violation of net neutrality. And what about rural consumers? The way rural areas are going to get coverage is only if ISPs invest in the facilities. Well, what makes them invest in the facilities? Possibility of making money. If you impose openended and vague regulations that constrain these firms in known and unknown ways, you are reducing their incentive to invest in those rural areas. So, when you think about it  well, beyond what net neutrality is intended to do, and you look at what it does do, you'll see that it harms competition. It harms consumers. It limits choice. Thank you."

    "label": "religion",
    "data": "Okay. So, I'm going to argue in support of the motion from several different angles. But first I'm going to put my cards on the table and say that I am not an atheist. I was raised Jewish, culturally more than religiously, but I still remain open to the possibility that there's some higher creative power in the universe, some benevolence that I can't quite comprehend that might deserve the name God. But remember, we're not here to debate whether God exists. We're here to debate whether God is becoming less needed as humanity evolves. And however, we measure that need  whether it's a need for explanations, a need for comfort, or a feeling of belonging, or just to give us a higher sense of meaning or purpose, the answer is clear. The more we evolve, the less we need God. Now, I'm going to go through these various forms of need one by one. But first, we should be clear what we mean by evolve. We're not talking about biological evolution or changes in gene frequency. We're talking about cultural evolution, or just the development of humanity. And scientific progress over the past several hundred years has completely transformed our knowledge of how the world works. And each major scientific breakthrough has had to overturn some religious dogma, right? So, we've gone from believing in special creation to an understanding of how all living things descend from a single common ancestor by blind trial and error process  natural selection. We've gone from believing that God placed the earth in the center of creation to an understanding that we inhabit a tiny blue dot in a vast cosmos with 100 billion galaxies. We've gone from believing that diseases were curses caused by evil spirits and bad karma to an understanding of the deep mechanisms of disease at the cellular and molecular level. But we still live in a world where people reject lifesaving medicine on religious grounds. Just the other day, there was a news story about a 2yearold boy who died because his parents chose prayer over medical treatment. So, the more our understanding evolves, the less we need God. Now, using God to explain natural phenomenon is an argument known as God of the Gaps. Throughout history, if there was a gap in our understanding, it was by default to say God must explain it. But the more science illuminates our world, and gives us a real understanding, the fewer gaps are left for God to inhibit  inhabit. So, when you hear from our opponents, be vigilant. They might tell you that the materialistic science can only explain so much. But we still need God beyond the limits of our understanding. That's a God of the Gaps argument. Just because science can't explain something yet, it doesn't logically follow that God wins by default. And if God is just another name for scientific ignorance, that's hardly a god worth celebrating. Now, my own field, neuroscience  350 years ago, Rene Descartes had argued that our perceptions had to be accurate because God would never deceive us. And our brains were made of physical mechanisms, but our conscious minds are an immaterial essence, a spirit that interacts with the physical brain through the pineal gland. But today, neuroscience is revealing that Descartes was wrong. Our perceptions are biased and inaccurate, which may explain the persistence of supernatural beliefs. And consciousness doesn't interact with the brain. Consciousness is what the brain does. And there's no reason to believe that consciousness existed before brains existed. Now, some people think they've experienced God directly, with or without drugs. But neuroscientists can now induce religious or transcendental experiences by stimulating specific brain areas with powerful magnets, giving people out of body experiences and sensation with oneness with the universe, not to mention hallucinations that would rival the Book of Revelations. So, the more our understanding of the brain evolves, the less we need God. And evolutionary and cognitive psychology are also helping to explain the origins of our need for God, for comfort, morality, sense of belonging, and why that need is diminishing. Religions traditionally provided a space for communal activities, a sense of trust among ingroup members, and a disincentive to freeriders. So, belief in God has done a lot of good throughout history. But our modern societies now provide laws and social safety nets to help us when we fall, and to disincentivize bad behavior. And our social reputations are online now. I mean, when it comes to people like Harvey Weinstein, I'd say that public shaming, social rejection, and criminal charges carry a lot more weight than the fear of hell. I mean, after all, he didn't hire priests for redemption; he hired lawyers and publicists. And the very existence of countries like Denmark and Sweden  majority atheist countries that are high functioning and relatively free from suffering  tells us that living without God is fully compatible with human psychology, as long as the need make sense of the world is satisfied by science and our need to belong is satisfied by our social networks and communities. So, the more our societies evolve, the less we need God. Of course, for many people, life is not as comfortable as it is for those Scandinavians, and God is a source of comfort for those who are suffering, or who have lost loved ones, or who are stricken by poverty or disease, and I get that. But if we're determined to work together to alleviate poverty, disease, and suffering, and make people happier in this world. And if we're aware of the fact that people tend, on average, to turn to God less often when they feel safer, happier, healthier, and more stable, then we have to admit that the motion is correct: The More We Evolve, The Less We Need God. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you. So, I of course request you to vote against the motion. When I use the word God  or all of us who are in practices like meditation, selfreflection, awareness of body, awareness of mind, awareness of mental space, awareness of the web of relationship  when we speak or practice yoga  when we speak of God, we are not talking about an imagined deity. We're talking about the consciousness in which all experience occurs. And we're defining consciousness in very precise ways. So, one way to think of consciousness is that which makes any experience possible  the experience of sensations, images, feelings, thoughts, perceptions, the experience of your body, the experience of your mind, this experience. So, consciousness is that in which all experience occurs. Consciousness is that in which all experience is known. And consciousness is that out of which all experience is made. All experience is made out of consciousness. In the wisdom traditions that I come from, therefore, consciousness is the imaginable potential for every mode of knowing and experience in all living beings. So, right now, we are having a human experience. This is a human experience. This is not the experience of a crocodile, or an insect with multiple eyes, or a snake that knows only infrared, or a bat that moves or navigates through the echo of ultrasound. This is a human experience in human consciousness. But consciousness is more than human consciousness. Consciousness is the basis of experience in every sentient being, in every living species. What their subjective experience is unknown to us, subjectively probably unknowable. So, consciousness  or God  is all knowers, all modes of knowing, and all experiences known. Consciousness is invisible. Why? Because it has no form. But without consciousness, there is no experience of that which we call visible. Consciousness is beyond perception. Why again? Because it's formless. It's boundless. It has no boundaries. It has no material structure to it. So, it's inconceivable. And yet, without it, there's no possibility of any concept. You cannot imagine consciousness. You can't imagine God, because if you imagine God, then it's not God. The infinite cannot be imagined. But without consciousness, there is no imagination. So, my dear friends, in every act of perception, right now, as you see, as you hear, as you sense your body  in every act of perception, consciousness as God is creating the experience of the universe for you right this moment. Right this moment. Consciousness and God  similar; I'm using the words synonymously  consciousness is the only invariant in every changing experience. If you think you are your body, then you have to question that, because your body is not a noun. It's a verb. It's been changing since the time you were a zygote, an embryo, a baby, a toddler, and who you are right now. So, in every act of perception  including that of your body, including that and every act of cognition, including the experience of your mind, God is creating the experience of the universe through you. When we transcend to this level  which is the source of [unintelligible] through contemplative practices, through yoga  when we transcend to this level of existence, then automatically, automatically  because we feel the unity of existence, the inseparability of existence, automatically there's the emergence of platonic values, like truth, goodness, beauty, harmony, love, compassion, joy, equanimity. There is also the loss of the fear of death, because consciousness being formless, it's not subject to birth and death  exactly what you said. Birth and death are opposite, but life is the continuum of birth and death. So, by knowing ourselves as consciousness, we get to the source of all experience in every species that we call God. Right now, in this awareness we are having this particular experience. If consciousness is God, then we need consciousness to evolve. Why? Because, as Heather said, right now we're not talking about biological evolution. We are talking about what I would call metabiological evolution  the evolution of our consciousness and ultimately the evolution of the consciousness of our consciousness. Because the key to consciousness, is selfawareness. God is our highest instinct to know ourselves. Thank you very much."

    "label": "religion",
    "data": "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. The resolution, that The More We Evolve, The Less We Need God, I think is supported overwhelmingly by evidence from three lines of inquiry: evolutionary theory, history, and the social sciences. Now  so first, John mentioned a synonym for need or  necessary; God is necessary. Necessary for what? I contend that our starting point is the survival and flourishing of sentient beings  that's us and other animals  and the central problem with group living  we're a social primate species  the central problem with group living is trying to figure out how to get selfish genes that build these survival machines that just want to have  maximize their own utility or benefits to cooperate with other survival machines built by selfish genes. And the problem is  is figuring out how we tilt the incentives or create a choice architecture to get people to be nudged toward increasing or attenuating  I'm sorry   extenuating their better angels and squashing down or lowering our inner demons. So, it's this constant conflict between our inner demons and our better angels. And so, when we began to coalesce from these tiny bands and tribes of hunter gatherers into these giant chieftains and states around 10,000 years ago, this was the central tension: how do we do this? So, the two tools or technologies that evolved to do this were God and government. So, government basically gives everybody a copy of the rules and says, These are the dos and don'ts, and here's the penalties if you violate them. Of course, there's not sophisticated police systems at the time. So, people got away with it. But you don't really get away with it, because there's an eye in the sky that sees and knows all that you're doing and can impose punishments in the next life. So, this is God or religion. So, for thousands of years, it was kind of a tossup between anarchy of having no state or government organization, and tyranny  having either oppressive governments or religions oppressing their people. And  but something  history  then evolved about four centuries ago. The Scientific Revolution discovered that the universe is knowable and that it's governed by natural laws that we can discover and understand, beginning with the physical sciences  Galileo and Newton  into the biological sciences and medicine, all the way to the social sciences. And so, in the Enlightenment, there developed a number of theories about how best we should live with one another. So, there was [unintelligible] essentially to create  to find the Newton of the social sciences. How best should we live? And that led to pretty much most of the moral progress we've made over the last several centuries. That is to say  the abolition of slavery, and torture, the death penalty, the death increase in civil liberties and civil rights, the expansion of the moral sphere, the bending of the moral arc, if you will, toward greater justice for more people in more places, more of the time, I argue, has primarily been the result of science, and reason, and these Enlightenment values like natural rights  not the function of religion or belief in God. In fact, I would argue that with a few exceptions, that almost all the progress has been the result of secular forces  that is justifying why you're making certain social changes or passing laws based on reasons, good reasons, and evidence, rather than appealing to a higher supernatural power. The problem with religion is that the creator of the universe has set down many different rules of how we should live together. And there's no means to determine which is the right one. There's nothing in religion  there's no methodology in religion comparable to science, in which we say, We're going to  let's run an experiment and see which one is the best, which one most closely matches reality. And I'm not just talking about physics and biology; I'm talking about social sciences. We have 50 different states with 50 different state constitutions and 50 different sets of laws  say, gun control laws, or tax laws. You can study those and determine which is the best set of methods we should use. Religion has nothing like that. The problem with religion is that it's more of a sort of group cohesiveness method that drives people to be more tribal and xenophobic. And then, finally, in my third line of inquiry on the social sciences, I'll cite just one study  among many  by Gregory Paul [spelled phonetically] of  correlating the differences between rates of religiosity, belief in God, Biblical literalism, belief in the afterlife, and heaven and hell  in 20 different leading democracies in the Western world. As a function of their societal health, societal health is measured by rate of homicide, suicides, STDs, abortions, teen births, marriage, divorce, alcohol consumption, life satisfaction, corruption indices  adjusted per capita income, income inequality, poverty, employment levels, incarceration, life expectancy and so on. Well, you can't believe this, but it turns out that the higher the rates of religiosity in a nation, the more people believe in God in a nation, the worst they score on these indices of societal health. And America stands out by far, with no one even a close second, as the most religious of the Western democracies and the worst on all of these. We have the highest homicide rates, suicide rates, teen STD rates, pregnancy rates, and so on. Income inequality, and alcohol consumption, life satisfaction, employment levels, and on, and on, and on. Now, I'm not saying that those things have  are caused by religion. But if religion and belief in God is such a great force for driving moral progress, how come it fails so abysmally here and every other nation where religiosity and belief in God is high? Therefore, I urge you to vote for our side, that The More We Evolve, The Less We Need God. Thank you."

    "data": "What if this world we're experiencing is a mental experience and not primarily physical? What if what we call the mind isn't just in here, but it's all this? And what if you and I are experiences in this vast mind? What I'd like to do is challenge the story we've all been taught since we were kids. I'd like to challenge the notion of what we are, what all of us are, and what this world is, what it's made of. Max Plank [spelled phonetically], a Nobel Prize winning physicist, said, I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. He didn't mince words. And what he's saying is something all of us experience when we dream  that the universe is entirely mental. Now, I'm not saying that this is a dream. What I'm saying is that whatever this is made of, whatever this is made of, it's the same stuff that a dream is made of  namely, consciousness. And when we look at it through different frames of mind, we perceive it differently  as mental, or physical, or however we may describe it: information, energy  you've heard all of these descriptions. Consciousness is primary. And what we call matter is an experience in our consciousness. So, this hand feels really firm and solid, and physical. I would describe it as physical  and if this were a dream, it would still feel firm, and solid, and I would still call it physical. And yet, we know that it would be made entirely out of consciousness. Now, if consciousness is primary, it's also infinite, simply because all experiences would be in consciousness. So, the space that appears to separate us right now is an experience. It's a projection. In a dream, I can take a space shuttle from Cape Canaveral all the way to the moon, and come back home, and I would cover half a million miles of vast space. And yet, with the shift in consciousness  that's what we call waking up in the morning, a shift in consciousness  with that shift, the very same space is reconceived as a projection. I submit to you the same is happening right now. Nobody has ever perceived anything outside of consciousness. That means every experience, including space and time, is in consciousness. So, history, philosophy, music, art, literature, you name it, it's in consciousness. With that context, let's attend to the motion specifically. Not only is consciousness infinite, but the infinite has always been the ultimate description of what we call God. The more common notions, the more familiar notions, and all the notions that were spoken about by the opposing team, they are aspects of God. So, there's infinity, but then we talk about infinite wisdom, infinite compassion, infinite mercy, infinite understanding. These are aspects of infinity. And this infinity shows up, not only in religion, but it shows up in mathematics, and philosophy as different aspects, different approaches. So, the ultimate god of religion  not the different forms of God; it's not the particular names of gods  which are the varieties we see that depend on the human mind that conceives them, but the ultimate God, the [unintelligible] infinity, that shows up in mathematics as infinity. It shows up in philosophy as truth. It shows up in science as the reality behind science. It shows up in all experience, in every experience, as consciousness. Each of these is a unique perspective. And therefore, each has unique data to contribute about something that's beyond all concepts. The more we evolve, the more we see the infinite underlying nature of all things. Call it religious, call it spiritual, call it secular, or simply the practical experience of knowing ourselves and each other more deeply. So, let me ask you  do we need to understand ourselves more deeply? Do we need to understand each other a little better? And do we need to understand this crazy, inexplicable world better? If your answer is yes, then I urge you to vote against the motion, because the more we evolve, the more we need to understand the infinite."

And the reason for that is who wants to hear, after all, that humanitarian war does more harm than good? This is a project that saves lives, that ends atrocities, and invokes universal human rights. It is an idea that should unify the world. Alas, it has divided it and divided it deeply on fundamental issues. Who has the right to intervene? Under what circumstances? With what objective? To stop atrocities, and end there, or to then overthrow the regime  as happened in Libya  or to stop atrocities and midwife the birth of a new state  as happened in Kosovo? These issues have not been resolved. Now, critics of humanitarian intervention worry about something else, and that is, Will this ostensibly universal principle be applied universally in practice or bent and twisted by the powerful and applied selectively? They're  they have good reason to be worried. If you are a great power  the United States, China, Russia  you do not have to fear intervention directed against you no matter what you do. Consider Russia and Chechnya in '94. If you are a middle power  India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt  you don't have to worry about intervention either, because you've got the military muscle to make an intervention costly. So, who does that leave? A miserable gaggle of friendless, isolated states. They, ladies and gentlemen, will be on the receiving end of this universal principle. I'll give you some examples. Saudi Arabia today is waging a ruinous and vicious war in Yemen. Let's put the strategic issues aside. Hundreds of people have died in air strikes by the Saudis. They have put down a blockade that has contributed to a cholera epidemic that has afflicted 1 million people  1 million. 10 million people are on the brink of starvation. Have you heard anyone  even from the humanitarian intervention camp  calling for penalties against Saudi Arabia? No. They're arming the Saudis. And as we speak, the crown prince is being received by Her Majesty's government. Let's look at another example. Myanmar. The government of Myanmar has killed 7,000 Rohingya, and the toll is amounting, and chased 600 others out of their homes. Do you think the government of Myanmar is worried about the hoofbeats of humanitarian intervention, the generals lie in bed worrying? Not at all, because they have China in their corner. Now, I wanted to speak about another problem that humanitarian intervention faces, and that is the law not just of unintended consequences, but uncontrollable consequences  uncontrollable consequences. Only one example because the clock is ticking. And that is Libya. Libya postintervention is a violent, anarchic mess  two governments, a multitude of militias, AlQaeda and ISIS, with chapters newly created in Libya. The entire neighborhood is threatened. Tens of thousands of refugees  tens of thousands of refugees have fled across the Mediterranean, pumping up the power of rightwing populist parties in Europe. Look at what is happening in Europe today. Now, I want to finish with Bosnia and Kosovo  that I haven't talked about. They teach us one lesson. If you want even a modicum of stability post intervention, you have to keep tens of thousands of troops on the ground, spend billions of dollars to do it right. I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that in the body politic of the West, and certainly the United States, there isn’t the political support to do it. Now, are the paragons of humanitarian intervention worried about this? Not at all! They have overweening confidence in their idea. That overweening confidence, ladies and gentlemen, slides sometimes into hubris, and that is yet another reason why this project, this noble project, does more harm than good. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you very much. Does humanitarian intervention do more harm than good? Not at all. You were talking, and this is a big mistake, about military intervention, not humanitarian. It doesn’t mean anything in humanitarian intervention. Let me give you some examples. The first one. Yes, sir, you were talking about Rwanda, April ’94. Sorry to say, I was there during all the genocide with my people, doctors and medical staff, and we did a lot. Compared to the genocide  compared to, let’s say, 800,000 of dead people massacred, it was nothing, but believe me, humanitarian intervention is not a problem of numbers of dead, of victims. If you can save one, and if it is your daughter or your sister or your father, this is a very important one. Humanitarian means human being. Human being; you have to count one after one. So, it’s not a question of military intervention. You were right in some of your examples. But we were before in Kosovo; we were before the humanitarian people, working with the people, not with the government. There was no government; it was the Serbian government. So, this is easy to counterattack all your examples. Afghanistan; [unintelligible] we were since 20 years working with the people, and there is still an hospital in Kabul, bombed every day, with explosions every day in Kabul. But the French hospital is still working without the government’s help at all. So, humanitarian intervention is not a military intervention. Neutrality is the rule. When we were working in Lebanon, we were working on Christian side, and on Muslims’ side, and on Shi’ite’s side, Sunni’s side, et cetera. We  there is no choice for a medical doctor or a humanitarian doctor. You don’t have to  the good deaths and the bad deaths; the good victim and the bad victim. Not at all. Never. So, we did. And the neutrality is absolutely necessary. And don’t mix up [spelled phonetically] military  sometimes military intervention to protect  to protect  some particular project is good, but usually we are not, and we are never asking about military intervention. Don’t mix up. And I can give you a lot of examples. You were talking about Mali. Mali; the humanitarian French involvement  but French doesn’t matter  international involvement was very  I mean [spelled phonetically], it was [unintelligible]. The people were a necessity who is calling [spelled phonetically]. In humanitarian intervention, you have to understand that somebody was calling, some victim, some group of victims, or a nation. We are not just, let’s say, choosing our victims and choosing our nation. Not at all. Rohingya is a good example. We were there, not enough to alert the people, and I agree with your example. It was necessary to intervene, and I asked my government. Unfortunately, I was not in charge of the government at the beginning. And of course, it’s a good example. We had to. Humanitarian intervention has to be before, close to the victims after a victim’s call, but not because the government or the military people are asking us. Never! This is a neutral intervention, and this is, according to my opinion, the proudness of human beings, and the proudness of the international community. If we are stepping back, and if I understand your slogan, we have to stop the humanitarian intervention and development intervention, and everything, and wait for the  so, we have to let them die. I don't accept that."

    "data": "Ladies and gentlemen, it's simply not good enough to reframe this debate as humanitarian intervention. For those of us who have been involved in these failed efforts over the last 20 years, the predominant effort has been brutally militarily  military and bloody. Ladies and gentlemen, let me take you down to Basra, to Iraq in 2004, command group meeting [spelled phonetically]. Middle of the night. The general showed up. It was a pep talk. Things weren't going so well. And the general said, Guys, I want you to be aware of one thing, and here's what I want you to be aware of. We are the biggest and best gang in the province, and don't you forget it. And ladies and gentlemen, that was true. There were 7andahalf thousand of us heavily armed, welltrained, wellequipped, and with a reasonably clear idea of our vision and our mission, which was to secure 1andahalf million people. We failed to do that. We ended up hunkered down in a military base, defeated, after some months. Cut now to Bosnia, the poster child for real humanitarian intervention. I was in that mission too. 60,000 of us there were, four armed divisions. We had complete military dominance across the spectrum. No one would touch us. But ladies and gentlemen, that was in a country of four million people. Kosovo, very similar. We had complete dominance. What I would like to hear from our opponents tonight is where we are going to get 60,000 troops to secure a relative  even a relatively small country not so far away, let alone one of the invadables that Rajan was talking about, which are likely to be much further away. And the kind of war involved in  let's be brutally frank about that. Noninternational armed conflicts, internal strife, call it what you will  civil wars. And they are the most brutal, complex, and difficult operations that can be conceived. You are involved, when you're in operations such as that, in a three dimensional chess match in the dark, against multiple adversaries who tomorrow may be your allies  others, your allies today, may be your adversaries or your enemies tomorrow. Against a background where, if you are not absolutely certain of where your objectives lie, ladies and gentlemen, you have no business in being in such an environment unless you're absolutely sure that you can secure yourselves and the people you are there to protect. And nowadays, the will, the means, the material, are no longer present within our polities, within our governments. We simply do not have the resources any longer to be able to sustain this kind of complex, deeply, deeply difficult operation. And now I turn, possibly, to the most important aspect, and one which I think most of you will be intimately familiar  with which most of you will be intimately familiar, the politics of all this. Because, let's be frank, who is going to be doing these interventions? Is Britain going to do it? Britain ran out of bombs after a couple of weeks in Libya. Is France going to do it? No. In all of the missions that we have sustained over the last 15 or 20 years, the United States have borne between 60 and 90 percent of the effort. Do you detect in the United States any political will for long, bloody, indeterminate poorly planned operations at the ends of the earth? Even if you assume there is some objective to them? Now, one of the themes of this conference is an increasing sense, I think, of insecurity in Europe. This is a final question I want to put to you. Is this what our armed forces should be doing at a time when, sooner or later, they may be  our defense forces  required to fulfill their advertised function of defense? I'm going to leave you with a thought. Just before I came here, I spoke to a friend of mine, one of my young officers in Iraq, badly injured, and I said I was coming to talk on humanitarian intervention. He said, Well, there’s a contradiction in terms for you. It’s war. And he's quite right. No matter how you dress it up, when you conduct this kind of intervention you are fighting a war. And there’s one thing the last 20 years have taught us. It’s that you don't control war; it controls you. Ladies and gentlemen, support the motion. Thank you very much."

    "data": "So, Bernard and my opponents in this argument make a number of good points, but they conflate warfare and humanitarian intervention in a way that I think  Thank you for that [laughs]. In a way that I think confuses the subject some. Iraq and Afghanistan aren’t humanitarian interventions. They’re wars. We fought them for a reason, and that reason wasn't protecting the people of Iraq or Afghanistan. The reason was protecting the people of the United States and Britain and other  and whatever you think about those wars, you should not  and the fact that we had humanitarian components to them, as, I think, Western powers ought always to have in their warfare, that doesn't make them humanitarian interventions. Humanitarian interventions are not always conducted by the military, although very often they need a military component in order to make them successful. And the reason that is, is because humanitarian crises aren't natural disasters. They're not earthquakes; they're not acts of God. They're acts of political malevolence. That’s why  that’s why violence is used for political purpose. That's what causes humanitarian crises. It's not a famine. It's an act of political violence by a government or another political actor. When that happens, that means a society is broken in some important way. So, I think we ought not to set the standard that humanitarian interventions very often fail to solve the underlying political problems, that they very often have unintended consequences, that they very often are complicated and get bogged down, and you lose your focus. The undertaking is intrinsically extraordinarily difficult. It's a society in transition, where political violence  where violence is being used for political purposes in order to gain political outcomes. But that doesn't mean they never work. So, even if you don't buy Bernard's impassioned appeal that even one life deserves defending, there are practical, hardedged policy reasons to engage in humanitarian interventions, and I will just offer two to you. One is that humanitarian interventions are often  humanitarian crises are often the prelude of worst humanitarian crises, and there the example is Syria, where if we, external actors, had taken action in 2012 or 2013, you would not  you may have seen a bad outcome, but it is unlikely to be worse than half a million dead Syrians, 11 million people refugees. the tottering of the surrounding governments of Jordan, Iraq, Turkey, and the fracturing of political dialogue in those countries as a result of the pressure that the violent collapse of Syria brought about. So  Thank you. So, it  it's not true that doing nothing should leave us with a clear conscience. It's also not true that doing nothing has no strategic consequences. Russia's return to a power broker role in the Middle East, for example, is a direct consequence of us not intervening in the terrible humanitarian crisis in the Middle East. So, humanitarian interventions are seeking to address a political crisis that has resulted in violence in societies. It's difficult to get it right. We very often get it wrong. But sometimes we get it right. I would argue that Kosovo is a success story. Did it require military force? Yes, it did. But did it also prevent Slobodan Milosevic and Serbs from doing a terrible, brutal injustice to people who were ostensibly citizens of their country? Yes. That's a great outcome. We ought to celebrate that. And I think it is a mistake to believe you can  that we can exist in innocence and purity in our own societies in our values. And this I learned from Randy Shinavan [spelled phonetically] and the McCain campaign in 2008. You strengthen our values at their ragged edges. People don't make brave choices when they are in danger. You need to stand next to them and help them make good choices."

    "data": "Thank you very much. You heard I'm a sociologist. I love sociology. I can't stop doing it. So, I thought, let's start tonight by getting to know each other a little bit. I'm going to do an old fashioned instant survey to get us going. So, let me just ask, how many people in this room  can you clap, please  if you have never done online dating  if you've never used an  oh, this is the National Public Radio crowd here tonight. And can you also clap loudly if you have used a dating app? Alright. Alright. We have  people, we have a future. Can you clap if you're single? Oh, special reception for you after the debate tonight. Clap if you're married, please. Okay. Somewhat disturbing. And just finally, if you could clap if you're currently in an extramarital relationship. Whoa! Ashley Madison, a dating app that is not dead yet. So, look, I have spent years studying modern love and romance. I have traveled around the world doing interviews and focus groups with people who are single. I have studied the data that come from dating companies. And I can tell you that it's true  millions of people are using dating apps and many are finding relationships. But we are here not to talk about the numbers so much as to talk about the experience. And let me tell you that the experiences of people who use dating apps are anything but romantic. And let's remember why we're here tonight, ladies and gentlemen. Our question is not Are dating apps popular? They are. We concede that. It's whether dating apps are bad for romance. And Manoush and I tonight are going to tell you why they are. But before we can do that, let's define the term. What is romance? Let's go to the Oxford English dictionary, a great source for this. It tells us that romance is this kind of feeling of mystery and wonder  Helen has written about this  that we get around love, but there's something else in the definition that's important to me. It's the sense of being swept away, remote from reality, away from everyday life. It's that sense of being preoccupied with some other person. You think about them and care about them so much that everything else kind of melts away. You forget about the mundane. That's the feeling that we try to recapture when we go on vacation, or when we go on a date, or when we make a meal for our special person. Right? It's that idea that we're lost in love. There's not another care we have in the world. Now, it is worth nothing that since the advent of the Internet, marriage rates have gone down. There are more people in the world who are single today than ever before. There are more people who are living alone. Still, I think that most people who are looking for love are able to find it, and technology won't change that. The thing is that dating apps are making just about every part of our search for love less romantic. Think about it. If you've been on a dating app, you know that it encourages you to treat people like products. People routinely lie about their height, their age, their weight, their income. They put huge amounts of attention into their photograph  and for good reason. About 90 percent of the action  online dating  is about the quality of your picture. Are you hot or not? 90 percent. But then we sent out heartless and sometimes cruel messages  things we would never say to a person in person  because the phones encourage us to treat people like bubbles on a screen. Unfortunately, the things that we do online are changing the culture. My fellow sociologists say that they're changing our norms, making us ruder, and flakier, and more selfinvolved. Have you taken a selfie recently? Here's the most important thing. Dating apps make it harder, not easier to be swept away by another person. Why is that? Because the phone demands our attention. It is always telling us that there's something or someone that deserves our attention more than the person we're with or the thing we're doing now. That's true for new couples, but it's also true for established couples as well. I mean, think about it. How often have you come home at night, if you're in a couple, looking for affection and connection only to find your partner cuddled upon the couch with his iPhone? How romantic is that? Real life and real relationships have a hard time competing with the stimulation that apps give us. On dating apps, the problem is there's too much going on. Today, people go into their phones, and they perceive a world of limitless dating choices. And unfortunately, this means it's very hard to settle on the person that we're with. We're always wondering, isn't there something better out there? Let's go online and find out. I have interviewed people who are on Tinder while in an Uber on their way to a date that they organized on Tinder hours before. And this matters because romance and love don't come from superficial connections. It's not really about whether you're hot or not. At the end of the day, romance is impossible without sustained facetoface contact. What's important is not the quantity of our dates; it's the quality of our interactions. And the main reason that you should vote for the motion tonight is because apps and the phone culture that they're part of have made spending quality time with another human being a very hard thing to do. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you very much, John. I really appreciate the opportunity to come out here tonight to debate. So, I usually don't do media or public speaking things. Like most people, it terrifies me. And being a programmer, I'm more likely to talk to a computer than another human being. But, you know, even though I'm not going to be as eloquent as Eric just was, I'm going to do my best. So, hello, everybody. My name is Tom. Hello. So, I grew up in a small town of Wayland, Massachusetts. And I attended Carnegie Mellon University where I graduated with a degree in computer science, as John just told you. And, you know, after graduating, I moved to New York to join this crazy startup called OkCupid that was trying to use the internet to help people find love. And, you know, working on a dating app, you know, let me tell you some of my interests. I love to travel, love candlelit dinners, long walks on the beach, and writing algorithms. So, I care a lot about the topic of dating apps and romance. You know, it's literally what I've spent the last eight years of my life thinking about every single day. And I may not look like a traditional matchmaker but today, you know, as Eric told you, I am the typical matchmaker because, you know, dating apps are the most common way to meet people now. And today, you know, I'm going to show you that instead of killing romance, the data actually shows that dating apps are creating romance. And even though Eric didn't want to talk about the numbers, I do. So, you're hearing things from him about bad behavior, having too many options, you know, arbitrary, irrelevant algorithms, which I take offense to. You know, but what you won't hear is, you know, them citing a number of studies that prove their point because the data isn't there in the context of dating. So, I've got three main points that I want to get across tonight. The first point is that more and more people are using dating apps to get together. You know, since building momentum in 1995 when the first dating apps started coming about, there's been a steady increase in the percent of couples that are using dating apps to get together. This is especially true of people who were marginalized before, the handicapped, the LGBTQI community and people over the age of 55. You know, says  a quick question to the audience, and remember, it's radio so make a lot of noise. Who knows somebody who's in a relationship because of a dating app? That's a lot of people. Turns out you're not alone. A number of studies estimate that over 40 percent of relationships today come from meeting on a dating app, and over 70 percent of LGBTQI relationships do. A recent study, called the Strength of Apps [unintelligible] that got global attention in 2017, says that we're actually seeing an unprecedented rise in the number of interracial marriages. And this sharp rise in interracial marriages correlates exactly to moments when popular dating apps were released  things like Match.com, OkCupid, and, yup, Tinder. This is what dating apps do. They break down barriers and allow you to connect, form relationships, get married to people who you might otherwise never have the chance to meet. What isn't romantic about that? So, my second point is that it's working. Not only are people getting together, they're staying together and they're happy. Studies have shown that married couples who met online report higher marital satisfaction and have a lower rate of breaking up than couples who met offline. And you might be thinking, Alright. So, what? Anybody can cite a study that makes them look good, right? Well, let's talk about something you can't fake  more data. It turns out that because marriages are registered with the government in the United States, the CDC happens to track marriage and divorce rates. Don't ask me why the CDC thinks that marriage is a disease. Don't know the answer to that one, but they've got the numbers. According to them, marriage has been steadily declining in the United States since the '80s. And this trend only began to change in 2009, where it started to bottom out, and it's actually started to rise again. You know, if you take a look at divorces  and specifically the rate of divorces per marriage  that's a trend line that's been going up over time. You know, people have been getting divorced more and more. But that trend also reversed in 2010. It's actually come back down to one of the lowest points in the last 20 years. So, now, well, correlation doesn't imply causation. You know, how could these negative trends have been reversed during the rise of dating apps? It's a hard pill to swallow. So, my last point is this. If dating apps have killed romance, where's the body? I looked everywhere. I couldn't find one. Qualitatively, people don't think that dating apps are killing romance. Pew Research surveyed 55 percent of people who don't use dating apps  think that they're good. A lot of people who do use them  80 percent  think that they're a good way to meet people. Quantitatively, people are still forming relationships and getting together. Again, over 40 percent of relationships today and over a third of marriages are due to dating apps. And you know, if this stuff didn't work, I wouldn't have a job. Dating apps aren't killing romance. They're making romance possible. And because of that, I ask you to vote no on the motion."

    "data": "I have the least degrees of anyone on this stage. I am not an anthropologist. I am not a sociologist. I am not a data scientist. I'm a mom of two kids. I'm a wife. I'm a journalist. And I host a podcast that is about how technology is changing everything in our lives. And my audience is extremely generous. Every day, we get emails and voice memos about how technology is specifically changing the way that they work, the way that they parent, the way that they fall in love. And oftentimes, they are looking for guidance on how to cope with this accelerating world. And so, that is what I hope to offer them on this podcast. But when I told them I was going to be doing this debate tonight, they had a message for you. In fact, they had a few things that they wanted you to know about their experiences on these dating apps. Some simply wanted to share the messages that they had exchanged with potential suitors. I'm going to read a few to you. And tell me if this would spark online romance for you. Hey! no, that's it, just, Hey! Nice legs even if you don't shave them. Yeah, those weren't too bad. Can I read you my favorite? I'm looking to shove my head between your legs and bend you over. What are you looking for? I know. My kids aren't listening. I just want you to know that. To be fair, several of my listeners did say that they eventually did meet a special someone with the help of an online dating site. But like anyone who has spent time on these apps, they first had to run the gauntlet of lewd messages or spend time exchanging messages with people who seemed really interested but then just seemed to disappear from their screens. One person wrote me, All the apps have bots of beautiful people who seem amazing and educated and hot and available and who will engage you for a few sessions, but then they ghost you. Okay, but let's say  yeah, exactly. But let's say you do make a connection. Okay, let's stay positive. Let's say you make a connection with the person, a real person, with the help of an app, and you go on an actual date. Then what? So many people told me that the transactional quality of their experience on these apps just seeps over into real life. Chrissy wrote me, I have come to despise that look a man gives you when you first meet, the gleam in their eye, the smirk. It makes me shudder. Immediately, I have to decide how hard I'm going to push to split the bill because clearly they think they're buying something. Ew. But at least that guy showed up. Listen to this story about a dude who really used one of these apps to manipulate people. Clip one. He was on Match.com, and he told me I was his type of porn. So, he told me that what he liked to do was start relationships with women and get to the point where it was going to be their first meeting. And I guess that was like the most exciting fun part for him, as it is for most people. And then you would set up a time and place for them to finally meet for the first time, and then he wouldn't show up. And he would do it over and over and over again. And that guy was actually her boyfriend at the time. And he broke up with her by posting a picture of himself on Instagram with his new fiancé. Good times. Okay. Now, listen. Have I shared with you the worst aspects of online dating? Maybe. And maybe you're thinking, like, oh my God, if it's so terrible, just don't do it, right? But here is the problem. The destruction of romance extends IRL, into real life. Even if you give up finding romance online, and you decide to look for love the oldfashioned way, in a bar  this is what you will find. Clip two? Yeah, so I walked into this bar kind of excited to see if I could connect with a guy. And I looked around, and every single guy at the bar was on their phone on dating apps, every single one. I got to the point where I realized I should just get on the dating apps and see if any of them are actually on it. But there's no point in interacting. No point in interacting, much less exchanging glances over a pint of Brooklyn Lager. Are you feeling tired? Are you exhausted by all these stories? Are you thinking, oh my God, this is so straining, especially for women. Yeah. Well, you're not alone. Here's Becca. It's just very exhausting. Like online dating is very exhausting. I'm like, obviously, not opposed to meeting someone in my life. It's just like, for me personally, I don't know where the [bleep] I would meet anyone in real life. My teammate told you how dating apps have destroyed romance. They've taken away mystery, remoteness. But I want to add that dating apps have destroyed another important aspect of romance, civility and conversation, basic emotional intelligence, eye contact, being able to read someone's body language and make them think, like at your best, like your best self, make them think that you are just amazing, and they are the most special person in the world, at least until you get to know each other, right? Look, we all know the internet is extraordinary. Information goes around so quickly we are connecting people all over the world. But is it good for romance? No. When human beings interact online, they often revert to their crudest instincts. Dating apps are no different and certainly not better. Give me a Twitter where people punctuate properly and treat each other with respect, and I will grant you a dating app that brings out people's most caring, loving, and romantic selves. Not gonna happen. And this is why you should vote yes for me and Eric."

    "data": "Good evening. I'm delighted to be here, and I'm delighted that you're here. I do an annual study with Match.com called Singles in America. We do not poll the Match members. It's a demographically and national representative sample based on the U.S. Census. We've done it for the last eight years and we've got data on over 35,000 singles of every age and every background. And today, this past year, 6 percent of singles met somebody in a bar  I'm not surprised about that. 24 percent met through a friend and 40 percent met somebody on the internet. Moreover, 57 percent think that online dating is a good way to meet people. Are they all crazy? Before we get into deep yogurt on this, into the weeds on this whole issue, I'd like to add a broader, more evolutionary, more anthropological perspective to apps, to romance, and to human nature. And I'm going to begin with a story. I was traveling in New Guinea, in the highlands of New Guinea, and I ran into a man who had three wives. And I asked him, How many wives would you like to have? And there was this long pause. And I thought to myself, Is he going to say five? Is he going to say 10? Is he going to say 25? And he turned to me, and he said, None. A lot of wives can be a real toothache. We are a pairbonding species. Even in polygamous societies, the vast majority of men and women pair up with one person at a time. And along with the evolution of human pairbonding, millions of years ago, we evolved the brain circuitry for romance. I study this brain system of romantic love. I and my colleagues, Lucy Brown, Bianca Acevedo, and others, have put over 100 people into a brain scanner, using FMRI to study the brain's circuitry of romantic love. And we've been able to show that the main circuits lie way below the cortex, where you do your thinking, way below the brain regions linked with the emotions  at the very base of the brain linked with drive. In this case, the drive to find life's greatest prize, which is a mating partner. In fact, this brain system lies right near the factories that orchestrate thirst and hunger. Thirst and hunger keep you alive today, romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on somebody else and pass your DNA on into tomorrow. This is a survival mechanism and it will not die, whether you swipe left or right on Tinder. In fact, if you're concerned about killing romance with apps, what about the automobile? In the 1950s, we suddenly had a rolling bedroom. What about the birth control pill in the '70s or Viagra in 1998? Technology cannot change the basic brain structure of romance. Technology is changing the way we court, and you're going to hear more and more about that. In the past, people pulled up in their horse and buggy and wooed at the lunch  on Sunday lunch. In my day, they called on the phone. Today, people email, and text, and meet, and seek a mate on the internet with apps. It's just the newest way to do the same old thing. In fact, these really aren't even dating sites. They're introducing sites. The only real algorithm is your own brain. When you go out and meet the person  and you've got to meet the person  your own brain snaps into action and you court the way you always have  smiling, laughing, listening, watching, parading, the way you did long before apps. In fact, romantic love is a little bit like a sleeping cat. 34 percent of singles have fallen in love at first sight. 45 percent have gone into a friends with benefits, thinking it's just going to be a one night stand, and it turned into a longterm committed relationship. And 89 percent of singles today believe that you can find the  if  when you find the right person, you could remain married for life. If that's not romance, I don't know what is. And I think they're looking in the right place. I did this study myself with Match, and I found that people who use internet to date have more education, are more fully employed, and more likely to want to marry. These sites certainly do have problems. But like any new technology, you've got to learn how to use it. And you've seen how people are not using it properly tonight. The biggest problem  and it was mentioned by Eric  is cognitive overload. The brain is not well built to choose between hundreds if not thousands of alternatives. So, what I would recommend is that you stop. If you're a dating person, after you've met nine people  the brain doesn't deal with more than about nine  stop and get to know one person more. And the more you get to know a person, the more you like him, and the more you think that that person is like you. Actually, I think romance is expanding due to something that I call slow love. Today, singles are taking different routes to love. Many of them are just hanging out for months before they even kiss. Others are working slowly into friends with benefits, then slowly into dating somebody. Dating has actually acquired a new significance, more important. And then slowly into living together before they marry. What we're seeing is a real extension of the precommitment stage before we tie the knot. Where marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship, now it's the finale. And we have even more time for romance. So, nobody gets out of love alive. You've heard about some of these people. We all suffer on the internet and off the internet as the poet William Butler Yeats once said, Love is the crooked thing. It is. But I will close with this, the drive for romance and love is one of the most powerful brain system the human animal has ever evolved. Apps have their problems, but apps cannot, never have, and never will kill the brain circuitry for romance. Thank you."

    "data": "Good evening. I want to start by saying that, obviously, it’s a bit of a difficult day to make the case that liberals hold the moral high ground. It is a  it is a week when obviously Congressman Conyers had to resign, when Senator Franken today resigned. My partner and I maybe asked if we could  well, my partner didn’t. I maybe asked could we just change the motion to men occupy the lower moral ground  but listen, despite those news realities we are prepared to argue that in fact liberals occupy the moral high ground. And here’s how we plan to go about making this argument. In part, by acknowledging that in the current news cycle it is important that in this case, in all cases of this kind, individuals cannot be held as the standard for any particular ideological, policy, or partisan worldview. We will not be making a claim, therefore, that any individual conservative or liberal can be used as a bludgeon against the entire worldview. Any conservative or liberal. So, showing that there is an immoral conservative, no matter what house they occupy, or that there is an immoral liberal is not in and of itself a sufficient condition. It has been true historically, and will continue to be true, that the character affiliated with liberal persons or conservative persons may be inadequate. That is not our argument. In fact, instead what we will argue is that the guiding frameworks, choices, beliefs, public policies, and historical trajectories and outcomes of liberalism with a capital L, versus conservatism with a capital C, lead us as a nation to more moral outcomes when the folks who are in charge, occupying elected office or movement leadership or positions of power, are people who understand themselves to be liberals. Now, this evening, our goal is going to be to offer evidence of that. Now, obviously, this gets me to the hardest part. What do I mean when I say moral? Now, we will undoubtedly in the course of our conversation occasionally make use of religious parables or phrases or that sort of thing, but that is not what we are here to make an argument about. What I want to make a claim of in my limited time remaining is that we actually share, as a nation, a civic religion that is laid out by our Framers as an aspirational morality, that is instantiated in America’s founding documents: the Declaration of Independence. Now I want to be clear: this document is aspirational, but it is also audacious. The author and signatories of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 tell us that, in writing and signing this document, they are telling the world what American morality is. They’re telling us that in this moment in 1776, as they separate from old King George, that it is their responsibility to tell the world why. And here’s what they say. We hold these truths to be selfevident, that all persons are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. To secure these rights, governments are instituted among persons, deriving their just powers from consent of the governed. Can you imagine anything less selfevident on the Monticello mountain in 1776? It is an aspirational document, but a moral one for certain. So, we take this as the standard of American civic morality by which both liberalism and conservatism must be judged. Human freedom, meaningful equality, the cultivation of human flourishing, and substantive popular governance. I’ll give them to you one more time: human freedom, meaningful equality, the cultivation of human flourishing, and substantive popular governance. If you claim to be moral, then, over time and on the whole, your ideological approach must demonstrate empirically that it provides for greater human freedom, meaningful equality, cultivation of human flourishing, and substantive popular governance. Dr. Dean and I have no doubt that we will be able to demonstrate over the course of this evening empirically that those persons who understand themselves as Liberal, with a capital L, consistently occupy the moral high ground. Because, as Rosa Parks says, I would like to be remembered as a person who wanted to be free, so others would also be free. The expansion through popular governance of the moral high ground through the American founding documents. Thank you."

    "data": "First, I want to thank St. Howard and St. Melissa for coming down from their moral high ground  to the ground the rest of us occupy. I was always wondering how do they get down from something so lofty? Is there like a fireman’s pull or an escalator? It turns out, it’s amazing how they arrived. They were actually escorted down by cherubs. They just sort of floated down, people throwing Noam Chomsky essays on the floor. Now, so I guess I thought this was a strange resolution. So, it has to do with moral behavior. Somebody has a higher moral ground than other. So, are liberals  do they behave better than conservatives? Well, half my friends are liberals, and half are conservatives. I don’t think the liberals are that much better. If you look at the data, conservative households give about 30 percent more to charity; they donate blood more; they volunteer more. Red states give about twice as much charity as blue states. So, it’s not obvious to me that liberals are better. Then you can look  well, maybe it’s about moral thinking; they just think in better moral terms. We have a guy here, right here, Jonathan Haidt who studies this for a living. And as I understand Jonathan’s work  always a dangerous thing to do to summarize in front of him  he says liberals and conservatives think morally differently. Liberals think about more harm and care. Conservatives use that moral axis for these, a bunch of other moral axises. So, they’re different ways of thinking. But one I don’t think that Jonathan’s work is better than the other. The third thing that’s odd about this resolution is thinking that our moral stature is based on what we hashtag or what we vote. Now, I confess, I happen to think politics is generally a competition between partial truths. Most great issues are competing goods; security versus freedom, equality versus achievement, diversity versus cohesion. And sometimes liberals seem to me a little better. On civil rights, on feminism, liberals are a little better. I think the conservatives, we had a pretty good 1980s. I think defeating communism was a great moral good, threatening capitalism to Asia was a moral good. I think we  we, on some issues, we’re probably a little better. But the core truth is we need each other to balance each other out. I need you to correct for my excesses, you need me to correct from yours. And we have to do that from equal standing, not from you on high down to us down low. And so, then the fourth thing  biggest thing I found out about this resolution is that you could tell somebody is based on a label. Now, let’s read the resolution carefully. This is not a resolution, Liberalism holds the moral high ground. This is not about a philosophy. The resolution is Liberals Hold the Moral High Ground, liberals as people. The claim of this resolution is that liberals, as people, are morally superior to Robby and me. And the rest of those who go by the label conservatism. In my case, that could be. I’m a pretty flawed person. But how would you know based on a label? And I fundamentally think that’s a  probably a bit of a pernicious way to think. If you think you’re superior to me and you come from a moral high ground, it’s pretty hard for us to have a conversation. If you think you come from a moral high ground superior to me, I can’t compromise with you because to do that would be to surrender my honor. If you think you’re morally superior to conservatives, well, then conservatives will act with angry resentment. And a lot of people voted for Donald Trump because they thought a bunch of tenured radicals along the coast thought they were morally superior to them. And so, if you want the kind of politics we have today, think you’re morally superior to the other side. And so, what I’m saying, is the whole idea of this concept that somebody has a moral high ground, higher than the people who disagree with them, is probably a pernicious concept. It seems to me also a sign that if you think you’re morally superior to a group of other people, it’s a sign you’re probably not. When I think of the people I really admire  I was with some ladies in Frederick, Maryland, and they teach immigrants English and then how to read. And they just radiated goodness and good cheer. And they were humble. They made you feel good. The thought of them saying, Hey, I’m morally superior, I am on a higher moral ground than you, it never would have happened because humility and grace and gratitude was at the core of their being. And so, the whole idea that one side morally pernicious, it just wouldn’t have occurred to them. And so, I say if you vote for this resolution, you’re voting for the idea that one side thinks they’re better than the other. You’re voting for a politics of value signaling and not of politics of discussion. And then, the final thing I’d say is that we’re not in 1994 anymore. Politics is no longer really about big government versus small government. That was the debate we had for a long time. We’re at a different moment in political history. And what we’re facing around the world is the threat of neither liberalism or conservatism, but of sort of global populism. And I’ve spent time with Steve Bannon. What strikes me about Bannon is that he has a coherent story to tell. He has a 50year plan. He has a  a set of convictions that he totally believes in. It’s like being with Trotsky in 1905. And it’s kind of impressive. I don’t agree with it. But what strikes me is that he’s the Bolsheviks, and we’re the Mensheviks. Those of us on right and left who probably disagree with Steve Bannon, we’re back on our heels, we’re surprised by events. We don’t have a coherent story to tell. It is  we have gone so long in defending the Democratic liberal order that conservatives and liberals both share we’ve forgotten how to defend it against its enemies. And, frankly, I’m going to spend a lot of the next years trying to work with anybody I can to – find, what is the story we jointly tell against the populists? That’s the challenge of the moment. How can we realign both our sides so despite our disagreements, we actually do agree on a lot of foundation within which we have civilized debate. And if you think you’re on the moral high ground, morally superior to us, we can’t do that. And Steve Bannon has a divided enemy, and Steve Bannon will win. Thank you."

    "data": "Well, David is a sophisticated writer and a sophisticated arguer, and he posed a question that is not up for debate tonight. He is quite correct, if liberals take the position that we are morally superior, then we will alienate those people who we seek to elevate. We are taking the position tonight about who has the high ground. And that really is a question about to what do we aspire as Americans, what kind of nation do we want to build? It would be destructive if this were a debate that conservatives are somehow subhuman, they’re inferior. They’re not. They’re people just like us. This is not a debate about who is infallible. Liberals often spend too much money. Sometimes liberals do have  want a government that’s too big. We have solutions that often don’t rely on individuals or ignore the possibility that individuals may contribute to the good of things, not relying on government solutions. And it is also true, particularly on the coasts, that many of us who are blessed with a great education and opportunity that others may not have find ourselves being condescending to those we oppose. And those are all things we shouldn’t do. But what we cannot do in order to make peace is to cede an ounce of ground on the notion that all people are created equal, that equal opportunity is fundamental for every single American, including people of color and women in this country, and that we have principles that cannot be abrogated. I’m going to argue tonight that those principles are the high ground. Now  it does not matter what we say. What we say is clever, it’s sophisticated, it’s funny, it’s amusing. It matters what we do. And I agree with my partner Melissa that we’re not talking about individuals. Roy Moore’s behavior is not a demonstration that conservatives have the low ground. But the fact that half the people in Alabama are willing to vote for him after demonstrating this behavior is of deep concerns, given that those people identify them as  selves as conservatives. And given that they are now weighing whether it is appropriate to vote for a candidate who is alleged to have molested a 14yearold and a whole series of 16 and 17yearolds in order to preserve some other value that they believe is important. So, they’re willing to throw under the bus, 15, 16, however many women have come forward, who, I believe  and I think people in this country should believe him. I think to impeach women in a position like this is an outrage. They are willing to throw under the bus individual women for the sake of longterm gain. I don’t think you can do that. If we’re going to do that with soldiers, we have to make it  it’s a terrible thing, soldiers volunteer for these jobs. People make sacrifices. People take on very difficult campaigns. People die, and it’s called great  in the interest of a greater cause. The people who have been wronged in Alabama are not people who are soldiers. And they don’t deserve to be thrown under the bus because of some conservative cause. And I would argue that the people who are making that decision are abandoning their own morals. They do not have the moral high ground, because they have chosen that in the service of some ideal that they hold up, they are willing to sacrifice individuals whose lives have been badly harmed by this kind of behavior. This tax bill is an abomination. Jesus said that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. Now, did Jesus think that rich men were all terrible? No. I don’t think he did. What he thought was that those people who have power  and money is power  have an easier time deluding themselves to believe that they are moral  morally superior than ordinary people who have to get up and work for a living every single day. The tax bill is a deed. It is not a philosophy. It is a deed that is going to affect every American. And the people who are benefiting from that tax bill are the people who already have more money than they ever will need in the rest of their lives. And the people who are harmed are children whose insurance program is going to be taken away; are graduate students hoping one day to make a better world through education who are now going to be taxed on income that they never even see because it’s tuition money that they don’t actually get. The victims are far greater than that. The average middle class family gets a $60 tax cut. The average millionaire gets a $34,000 tax cut. And guess what? The tax cut for middle class people goes away after five years. So, 75 million families will get a  at the bottom of the economic scale will get a tax increase as a result of this. So, it matters not what we say. There’s going to be a lot of clever people. I think we’re pretty smart. It matters not what we say; it matters what we do. And what conservatives are doing to this country now is an outrage. I think that Ronald Reagan did do a good thing by helping to defeat communism. I think that it does matter what we do abroad. And I have actually sided with Republicans on some issues because we do not have all the wisdom. I think charter schools are a good thing if they’re good. I think we should listen to everybody and contribute. But I think the core philosophy of who we are determines who has the high ground. And I believe that’s liberals."

    "data": "First I want to say how honored I am to be here. Thank you, Robert. Thank you, John. It’s a special honor to be with Governor Dean and with my dear old colleague, Melissa HarrisPerry. And of course it’s great to be a tagteam partner with my old friend David Brooks. The speech that Governor Dean just gave the people  the conservatives of Alabama I want to endorse. The end does not justify the means. If you try to defend your values by sacrificing other important moral principles, you lead your nation to the chaos road. But I need to point out that I made precisely the same argument to my liberal colleagues at Princeton in 1997, 1998, and 1999 when the women were being abused, when they were being trashed, when they were being cast aside. And I was told that there are values that are so important we have to look aside from Bill Clinton’s behavior. So, neither side can claim the high ground on that issue. The governor and professor HarrisPerry have taken the burden of defending the proposition that liberals have the moral high ground. They don’t. I wish I could say as a conservative that we conservatives have the moral high ground, but we don’t. Alas, it isn’t true. Neither side today has the moral high ground and that’s because both sides have permitted themselves to descend into dogmatism, ideological tribalism, contempt for people who disagree with them, an unwillingness to listen and consider that they might be able to learn something from people who have a different view. We demonize each other. We attack each other. We have become mere partisans. We look out and what do we see? We see this on both sides. Progressives are no better than conservatives. I wish conservatives were better than progressives, but, as I say, in general they’re not. Now, there are exceptions. There are wonderful exceptions. I chaired in 19  in 2016 the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom. And assisting our efforts to aid persecuted people and prisoners of conscience in places from Cuba to Iran, there were honorable progressives like Representative James McGovern, a staunch progressive from Massachusetts, and honorable conservatives like Marco Rubio with no political advantage for them on these issues here in the United States. They stood up and they stood up whether the persecuted were in socialist Cuba or were in Iran. But too often that is the exception. There are too few such people in either movement. The general trend is, rather, to demonize people who have a different political creed, to adopt an air of moral superiority toward other people. And that is fraying, my friends, the bonds of civic friendship that a nation depends on when it is a nation that is not built on blood and soil, a commonality of ethnicity or religion, that has to rely on a common commitment to the proposition that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator  not by government  by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. But we fray, and we abuse, and we put in grave jeopardy the bonds of civic friendship when we refuse to recognize that there may be something valuable/useful in what the other side says. Both the conservatives and the progressives or liberals have had their glory moments. The liberals were in the leadership position; they were in the vanguard of the civil rights movement. Too many conservatives were on the wrong side or were off the field of battle. But we go back just a few years earlier, and it was the progressives on the wrong side of the eugenics movement, with a few conservatives, mostly Catholic conservatives, religious conservatives, saying, No, this is an abomination; we mustn’t go there. So, both views have had their glory moments, and both have had their moments of shame. And you know what that should tell us? Whether we’re conservatives or whether we’re liberals, it should remind us that we are human beings who are fallible. We can be wrong. We don’t know that we’re not wrong about even our most cherished, deepestheld, even identity forming values, and we won’t know unless we’re willing to engage those on the other side as equal partners in debate, willing to learn something from them. As David said, there are partial truths here. Both sides appeal to important moral principles. Progressives want to use the power of government to protect the weakest, the most vulnerable, from misfortune or the depredations worked against them by the powerful. That’s a good impulse. Conservatives should endorse and embrace it. Conservatives care deeply about the integrity of the institutions of civil society that can be enervated and undermined by big government; they care about personal responsibility. They care about social mobility. They know that markets have lifted millions of people out of poverty across the world, in places like India, for example. They know that the market needs to be properly regulated, but they know that when government steps in to take over everything, what you get is the alliance of big government and big business that we know as crony capitalism. And the crony capitalism we have today is the work of both conservatives and liberals. No one has taken up the challenge of undoing it. And when someone does, then that person is entitled to claim the moral high ground."

    "data": "Thank you, John. Tonight, you're going to hear Christine and Len argue that mandatory enforcement of amateurism is a bulwark against the forces of overcommercialization that threaten to destroy college sports. They'll ask you to ignore the fact that college sports are already hypercommercialized with billiondollar TV contracts and events like the ChickFilA Peach Bowl. But to economists like me and almost any economist not on the NCAA's payroll, the NCAA's enforcement of amateurism is not noble. It's the classic conduct of an anticompetitive cartel. A cartel is a set of independent firms  here, the member colleges and universities of the NCAA  that fix prices in a market where they would otherwise compete. Cartels are illegal in the United States. People go to jail for pricefixing and firms have been punished for attempting to fix the price they pay their workers. In the 1990s, one cartel that was trying to fix wages was punished by a federal court, which said  and this is a quote  the cartel ultimately robbed suppliers of the normal fruits of their enterprises. That cartel was the NCAA, which had tried to fix the wages that were paid to coaches by the schools. And they said, Well, we need to, because we have to preserve amateurism. We need to save costs. And the court said, Those may be fine goals, but they don't override the coach's right to seek employment in competition among the schools that would employ him or her. And so, my proposition to you is, rather than voting yes to the simple Pay college athletes, I want you tonight to vote yes to the idea that college athletes, like their coaches, have the right to a market free of collusion, like all of us do under the law. Tonight, you may hear the argument that if college athletes are paid, that suddenly and magically they'll stop being students. That's nonsense. Students in college get paid all the time. They work in the library. They work in the bookstore. They get paid if they're in student government. They get paid for   on the school newspaper. One of my roommates in college got paid a commission every time he placed an ad in the school yearbook. Emma Watson was at Brown University when she made many of her Harry Potter movies as Hermione Granger, and she was paid an exorbitant salary because she was able to access a free market. We might not have approved of how much money she got. We may have been worried that she would have spent the money frivolously or maybe even dangerously, but we didn't deny her, her adult right to go into the market and seek compensation free of collusion. That same adult right has been denied to college athletes. So, where Emma Watson was treated like an adult, DeShawn Watson, who won the national championship at Clemson, was not. Instead, he was told he could have a fixed price, and that was it. I'm not here to argue that every college must pay every athlete. Instead, my proposition is simple  that college athletes have the same right of market access as their coaches, and as the rest of us here, and that we have let them  that right be usurped by the NCCA through collusion. Should we pay college athletes is a really arrogant question. Who are we to tell a group of people whether they can or can't earn a living under the same rights that the rest of us have? A better question is, if there were no collusion, would college athletes get paid? And if the answer to that is yes, then you know they're being exploited  because their pay is being held down by a cartel. So, would they get paid? Of course, the answer is yes. One answer  one reason we know this is because college athletes are already paid. In exchange for their athletic services, they are provided with room, board, tuition. And since about 2015, they get about $400 a month in cash as well. This is not a free education. It's a quid pro quo  services for services. Athletics for education. Now, Joe is going to talk about whether that education is being provided fairly or not. But my point here is that in a market, if schools were not bound by NCAA collusion, they would offer athletes every single bit of education they offer them today, and education. It's not an either/or. It's a both and. And anything else you hear about this tonight ends up being a quibble when you think about it being a fundamental right. So, one quibble you might hear is that Alabama and Ohio State will get all the best football players and Kentucky and Duke will get all the best basketball players. But that happens now. There's actually very good economics that shows that fixing prices hurts competitive balance; it doesn't help it. You may hear doctored NCAA statistics that nobody makes any money  but there's plenty of money when the coach needs $500 million pay, the assistant coach needs a million dollars. And the good news is that unlike coaches' pay, as athlete pay rises for men, Title IX ensures that an equivalent amount will be dedicated to women. So, what we'll see is a sort ofTitle IX 2.0. If you hear the myth that compensation and education just aren't compatible, please listen carefully. It's about something about who's getting the money  why is it okay for Emma Watson to get the money, and Katie Ledecky to be paid to swim while she's at Stanford, but it's not okay for DeShawn Watson or for Richard Sherman to get paid to play football while he's at Stanford? Finally, don't fall for the fact that no one will watch. If no one will watch, then no one will pay, because pay in a market is driven by businesses' desire to attract customers. And so, if in your mind, you suspect that, if allowed to, colleges would pay, then what you're saying is that you know that fans would still attend. And that's why I want you to answer Yes to the proposition, because athletes deserve the right to find out the answer, what they're worth."

    "data": "Pay for play is a copout. It teaches nothing. It infects the true mission of sports and higher education, and you got to consider this. There is no right to play college sports. There is no statutory, natural, or Godgiven right. No one forces the athletes to play. There are options that exist for basketball and even football players to play somewhere other than college. It's a benefactor/beneficiary relationship, where the athletes, as beneficiaries, accept the conditions set forth by the benefactors, in exchange for the benefits that include free education, free worldclass training. Now, if you quantify those benefits  room, board, books, tuition, cost of attendance, stipends  which can sometimes go as high as $6,000  then add medical benefits, worldclass coaching, training in worldclass facilities, the ability to build a brand on national TV. How much would those benefits be worth on an open market? Now, no one can argue that the NCAA has done it perfectly, but no one can reasonably argue that these benefits don't have significant value. The mission of higher education is leadership development. Competition against similarly situated folks on a plain surface in front of crowds is a dynamic element of leadership development. That kind of pressure yields diamonds even among athletes who never make it to the pros. Few college students have that opportunity. Pay for play blows up that mission with its distractions. Only tuition is tax free. You know, any benefit not directly attached to the education mission is taxable, but the IRS just looks the other way for now. Imagine every athlete having to file a tax return. That just adds to the burdens that college athletes already have. Pay for play destroys the pro social benefits of college sports. Ninetysix percent of the revenue derived from tickets and media sales go back to the institutions who in turn utilize it for programs that work to the benefit of student athletes. The revenue serves the greater good. That includes supporting division two, supporting division three, subsidizing non revenue sports with money for scholarships and other beneficial programs. Now, pay for play obliterates the line between sports and  pro sports and college sports. College sports galvanize small city and big city communities, college communities. The academic and sports success of beneficiaries lead benefactors to contribute more. And the success of the beneficiaries through graduation, earning a degree, and post sports and college success leads them to become benefactors through foundations, through other ways that they contribute to the community causes. And, yes, it is a social and racial justice issue, however, not for the reasons our opponents have stated. You know, black athletes carried a burden of academic failure in revenuegenerating sports. Fifteen years ago, the graduation rate for AfricanAmerican basketball players was 46 percent. Today, according to the graduation success rate, it is now 77 percent. Now, those numbers can improve, but guess what. They were done without paying a single dime of pay for play. Now, nevertheless, the growth over those 15 years is something that people marvel at. But the bottom line is it's just a shiny object that draws these athletes out momentarily. But it gives them nothing as far as future survival. You've heard from the opposition, Fair value, or college athletes, or you will. How about focusing on valuing education fairly. For people of color, particularly black athletes, education is resistance. What better than a degree to help you prepare and resist the ravages of racism in a world that essentially is hostile to you because of the color of your skin? It's time we viewed pay for play as a sarcastic deterrent and payoff to deter that type of resistance. Now, if you were distracted by all this fake money, imagine what it's going to do to an 18yearold who thinks that he or she is going to college to get paid as opposed to getting a higher education? The corruption in college sports that we probably will touch on has its roots fueled by money. But rather than destroy those roots, pay for play deepens them. Every ill that has been mentioned and will be mentioned by the proponents of pay for play can be cured by controlling spending, continued academic reform, and assuring that direct commercial success inures to the benefit of the college athlete first and foremost to health, safety, and welfare not by substituting a fix in amounts that probably will have less impact than an earned degree on the lives of these athletes. And, for that reason, I urge you guys to vote, No, on this proposition."

Let's exploit black college football and men's basketball players for the greater good of everybody else. That's the bottom line. Now I have six points I want to get through, so I need to get moving, but I'm going to start where Len started, education.

In fact, it says on the website In the collegiate model of sports the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first, athletes second. And Len says that the college education is so valuable that an athlete should be thrilled to have this as his only form of compensation and should ignore how much more the market might provide. You know, here's the deal. Education should be their trump card, but it's actually the reason you should vote with us. Because far too many college football and men's basketball players simply don't get a real education or anything close to it. So, you've read about the University of North Carolina scandal. Twenty years, fake classes. Right? No professor. No class. One paper which is graded by the administrator. Right? And not only did the NCAA say that this was okay that it didn't violate any rules, they called it a benefit, a benefit to the athlete. The thing about that, fake classes are a benefit to athletes who are there to get an education. Explain how that works. Explain how that's right. Now, race. Race is an important, important subtext of this whole conversation. The University of Auburn, 3.2 percent of the undergraduates are African American. Seventyeight percent of the football and men's basketball players are African American. There are similar stats at places like every bigtime sports school practically, Ohio State, Florida, University of Louisville. Sometimes close to half of all division one football athletes receive PEL grants, which are reserved for the lowest income families in America. A college education is supposed to be life changing, but listen to some statistics, some real statistics, not the phonied up NCAA graduation statistics, which by the way, don't count any athlete who drops out. That's the graduation statistic doesn't count athletes who drop out. Think about that one for a second. In the big 10, black men's basketball players have a graduation rate of  that is 36 percent lower than nonathletes. The big 12, minus 42 percent. The mountain west, minus 51 percent. Michigan State 33 percent of black male athletes graduate in six years compared to 78 percent of nonathletes. And a lot of those who do graduate major in something called eligibility, i.e., they just take any class that the academic advisor sends them to so that they  so they can stay on the field. This is exploitation. I don't even know how else you can call it anything else. They've been recruited to the campus for one reason, one reason, to generate revenue for the university. That's why they're there. You can't say that about anybody else on campus, including I might add, hockey players and baseball players who don't generate revenue. So now they're going to say now they're nonemployees because they're quote unquote student athletes, right? They're not employees. But when the NLRB in Chicago held a hearing to discuss whether the Northeastern football team qualified under the law as employees, they wound up saying yes, they did. They work 60 hours a week. Their boss, their coach, controls almost every aspect of their lives. They are employees. They can't take classes that get in the way of their sport. That's why they're there. Now, student athlete. I got to do this quickly because I'm running out of time. You're going to hear that phrase a lot, student athlete. You know where it comes from? 1956. The NCAA made it up because some states were thinking of giving badly injured football players Workman's Comp. So, the idea is if you call everybody student athlete they'll think they're students and they're not employees and therefore they won't get student  Workman's Comp no matter how badly they're hurt. That's a really fair system, don't you think? We've talked  everybody agrees that college sports is a huge business. It's actually a $13 billion business, just a little bit less than the NFL, and you know, we're all talking about how much money the coaches make. ESPN is paying $7.3 billion to televise the new college football playoffs. That's three games a season. Three games. So why is it okay to have a business that maximizes revenue in every aspect, but the labor force is supposed to be free? How is that right? I want to talk finally about scandals. So, we have  every scandal revolves around money. Somebody's passing money to somebody under the table. That's what happens over and over and over and over. The latest one is the Louisville Scandal where, among other things, a marketer for Adidas was paying a player $100,000 to get him to go to the University of Louisville where Adidas has paid, by the way, $160 million to put the uniforms and the shoes on the athletes of all the  of all the teams. The NCAA finds this horrifying. It's a huge scandal. It's terrible. But think about what kind of scandal this is. This is like prohibition. Drinking was against the law during prohibition until they changed the law and then drinking was fine again. That's what's going on here. If you vote with us, you're voting for a system that is healthier, fairer, more honest, and more just. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you, John. Thank you. Well, thanks for being here, everybody. It's a real delight to be up here with four friends. And I do have to give Joe and Andy some credit here. I'm going to give you your props right away, you've used the word, women, as well as men in this conversation because, folks, let me tell you this. When you have heard the conversation about paying athletes, what have you heard, the words, basketball, and, football. They haven't used the word, pesky  the pesky adjective, men's, have they, men's basketball? No, no, it's been basketball and football as if there's no other sports that exist. So, I have to give you guys credit for talking about women because can you imagine a place, a time in this country, where you could pay men but not pay women? And, in reality, that is what this conversation has been. Guys, again, all props to you for mentioning women, for acknowledging that women play sports. But when we hear this argument over and over again, ladies and gentlemen, it's about men. 2017, we're going to pay men but not women? And I know you guys said, We will. You talk to any athletic director in the country and they're thinking, Wow, how in the world do we do this? How do we pay field hockey as well as football? You have to under Title IX. Or, if you don't, if the idea is all about revenue producing and we're only going to pay the people that supposedly make money, if you do that, well then think of the Title IX lawsuits. You will just have hundreds and hundreds of lawsuits in this country as there should be if, in fact, you're not paying women equal to men. That is a conversation, and that's one of the things that I would like to focus on with my teammate Len, here, is what is this going to look like? What is this going to look like? So, Okay, let's pay them. Let's pay everybody. I've got some college football fans here? Shout out one of your  your school you cheer for. Anyone cheers for Alabama? Auburn? Another one? Male Speaker: Maryland Terrapins. There you go. Wow, there you go. Len, I think we got his vote. So, you guys are from Maryland. You've got an offensive tackle. Now we're paying them. We're paying, what, 100,000 a year? And all of a sudden Auburn says, You know, we need an offensive tackle, halfway through the season, and we'll pay him 150,000 a year. So there goes your offensive tackle, right, if you can move around? Now, maybe you have rules, right? And you say, Well, you can't move except for a year or two. Think about that. Think about the money, as if we need more money in sports, and what will that look like? Len mentioned, of course, paying taxes, all these kids now having to pay taxes, the field hockey players moving from here to there because they don't like their job, the way you might want to move halfway through a year in a job that you're in, the chaos that that could leave for everyone. And as fans of football, there is something to say, Hey, when that punter is out there on the field and you're cheering for him, that he was in a chemistry class as you were. And I know our friends are saying, Oh, they'll still take classes. Really, really? Yeah, that would be wonderful if they do, but the odds are, if they're there for the money, it's minor league sports and they're just going to want to obviously play football or whatever the sport is for the money. It would be great to have them in class, but will they? I was with a whole group of big 10 people, actually, on an Alaska cruise and I asked this question. I said  these are super fans. They've spent money to go to Alaska. They have season tickets. I said, Would it change football for you, and men's basketball for you, if we were paying everybody? And I asked for a show of hands and every single person, Iowa, Purdue, Minnesota, Ohio State, Maryland, Northwestern, where I went to school, everyone said it would change it for them. They would be less likely to support it. They would be less likely to go and cheer for it. So, those are just the facts, folks. You know, the other thing that we hear a lot from our friends on the other side of this issue is the conversation about athletes not being compensated. And Len referred to a little bit of this. But I just want to make sure I make this point clearly. Forbes Money  who knows exactly what the dollar figure is  Forbes said that $2 million dollarsplus, over four years, for a football player, that the value of that education and that experience at a college  2 million plus. USA Today, my newspaper, men's basketball  a half million dollars, they figure, over the four years. Again, what is that? Len mentioned it. Elite coaching. Tutoring, training, food, medicine, all of those wonderful things. The exposure on Saturday night to show your wares, so that someday, a future employer can see what you're doing and hire you. What would the violinist in the symphony  in the school symphony give to be on TV every Saturday night, so that you could watch her do her thing  playing the violin so that she could someday be hired by a symphony? What is the value of being on network TV over and over, as football and men's basketball is? Maybe someday we will have the Violinist Channel. I don't know. But right now, we don't. But think about the value of that and what these student athletes have now. And I  the last thing in the last minute that I have here is that we hear that money is floating all over  around  of course, all over the place. Absolutely. Are college coaches paid exorbitant amounts? That's not the conversation for today. I think all four of us could agree the answer is yes. These college coaches  football coaches, men's basketball  are paid through the roof. That's not what we're debating here today. We're debating about the funds that are there. And according to USA Today, 23 programs are selfsufficient, 23. Not hundreds. And I know we may disagree on this, gentlemen, but the reality is that for all the money that they're bringing in, so many of them are spending it, and there's 23. The Ohio States, the Michigans, the Floridas, the Texas, the  you know, those are the schools that are making the money. The rest are not balancing out. So, this idea that there's money just floating around there to pay everyone  we're finding that's just not the case. So, anyway, thanks so much for listening. Hope you vote with us, and on we go. Thank you very much."

    "data": "So, when I grew up, my parents and my aunts and uncles  my grandparents  would tell these jokes. They grew up in socialist Poland, and I just  but I didn't always quite understand. But I've been thinking back to one of them a lot over the last year. It's pretty straightforward. It plays in a small town in the Soviet Union. And the guy is coming off work late at night. He's walking home. And here's some other guy, completely drunk on the side of the road, throwing up into the gutter. And as soon as he sees the guy, he puts on a big smile. He walks over. He puts a hand on his shoulder, and he says, I completely agree with your political analysis, comrade. I think you understand why I told that joke when I look at what's going on in our politics here in the United States, but also in Europe. It's easy to feel disgust, and I feel disgusted. I feel disgusted when our president denigrates the people who are in need of help at the moment in Puerto Rico. I feel disgust when our president calls neoNazis some very fine people implicitly, in response to Charlottesville. But today, I don't want to talk about disgust and I don't want to talk about emotion. I want to make a rational, careful, calibrated case for why, unfortunately, I do believe that democracy is threatening suicide at the moment. Now, what would it take for us to believe that? If we put our disgust aside, why should we think that democracy is threatening suicide? Well, I think we have to show two sides  two things to be true on this side of the debate. The first is that people really are quite fed up with democracy  that they're falling out of love with democracy, that they've had enough of it, in many ways. Now, thankfully, that's something that my academic research speaks to directly. I've shown in the last years that the number of people who say it's important to live in a democracy has gone down a lot. When you ask Americans born in the 1930s and 1940s how important it is for them to live in a democracy, over twothirds say it's essential to them. When you ask millennials  like in 1980  how important it is for them to live in a democracy, less than onethird say the same thing. Even when you ask about straightforward or offer alternatives to democracy, the number of people who say that they are in favor of that has gone up. 20 years ago, 1 in 16 Americans said that they're in favor of Army rule. Now it's 1 in 6 Americans. 6 percent of young and affluent Americans used to think that Army rule was a good thing, now it's 35 percent, a nearly sixfold increase. And this is not just in the United States. In France, in the United Kingdom. About 1 in 4 people used to say that they want a strongman leader who doesn't have to bother with Parliament, with elections. Now 1 in 2 do. These are shocking numbers. And they're not just abstract questions that people are asked on surveys. You can see from the results an actual voting behavior. You see the election of Donald Trump in the United States, a man who promised even before the election to keep voters in suspense about whether he would accept the outcome of the election, who threatened to jail his main political  not adversary, but opponent, in his mind. You see the rise of parties like Alternative for Germany, that is now the thirdstrongest as of elections 10 days ago. A party many of whose adherence in leaders want, I quote, A 180degree turn in our understanding of World War II. So, this is not abstract. It's actually resulting in real action. So, that's the first thing we've got to believe  that a scary] number of people is fed up with democracy, is becoming more open to alternatives, is threatening to immolate democracy. But there's a second part that we have to convince you as well  which is that these movements are actually dangerous, that people like Donald Trump, that people like Marine Le Pen, that people like Frauke Petry in Germany, can do real damage to democracy. Now, there's some great examples of that happening in the world. And BernardHenri is going to tell you more about some of those cases. We're going to talk about Poland, and Hungary, and Venezuela, and Russia, and Turkey  and all of those other places where populists, authoritarian populists have been able to undermine independent institutions, to take a lot of power and control. But for the last minuteandahalf that I have in my opening statement, I want to tell you about the logic of populism, why it is that these populists end up being dangerous to democracy and it’s for a very simple reason. It’s because they think politics is simple, because they think that all of our problems are befall off the elite that is corrupt, is selfserving or cares more about minorities and foreigners than they do about the real people. And it’s this mindset that makes them promise voters everything, get into power and say I’m going to solve everything. And of course, once they get into power they start saying who knew that healthcare could be so complicated? Who knew that keeping the peace of North Korea is not so easy? And so, what do they do? They start to blame. They start to blame independent institutions. They start to attack judges. They start to attack the press. They start to attack minorities. And once somebody who’s in power does that, democracy is in real danger. So those are the two things we want to convince you of today. A lot of people are fed up with democracy. As a result, they’re starting to vote [unintelligible] populists, and [unintelligible] populists are really dangerous. Now I’m not saying that democracy is doomed. I’m not saying that there’s nothing we can do in response to that. It is threatening suicide. That doesn’t mean that it’s committed suicide yet. And we can stop it. It’s our duty to try and stop it. But to do that, we have to recognize how serious this moment is and start to do whatever we can to save our political system. Thank you."

    "data": "Well, that’s right, I’m going to argue that Western democracy isn’t threatening to commit suicide. Attachment to the democratic principle of government by consent under rule of law is as strong as ever across America and elsewhere in the West. That’s what I want to argue. I do want to stress one thing at the outset. Much of what we’ve seen in Western politics lately, and much of what we’ll be discussing tonight, is disturbing. We’ve seen a rising tide of populism, and this surge has led to some very bad choices of leaders and of policies. Democracy and the rule of law don’t save us from bad choices. They don’t always protect us from leaders that let us down, or from policies that will make us worse off. They don’t prevent mistakes. But they do leave power in our hands so that we can correct those mistakes. That’s the core of the case for democracy. And contrary to what we’ve heard so far, I see no sign in the West of support for this fundamental idea is wavering. Now my partner Kori is going to have more to say about populism more broadly, but Donald Trump and Brexit is seen as leading products of democracy’s selfdestructive instincts, so I want to start there. Trump is a loudmouth, a narcissist and a bully. He knows next to nothing about public policy, and he’s fine with that. He may well have authoritarian instincts, and his appeal is in part the appeal of a demagogue. You could say he’s testing the American constitutional system. But you’d also have to say that the American constitutional system is passing this test. Already he’s been checked at every turn by Congress. Again, and again, he’s been checked by the courts. After he fired James Comey as head of the FBI, Trump’s own Justice Department appointed a special counsel of renowned drive and integrity to take the Russia investigation forward. Perhaps Trump will be foolish enough to try to remove Mueller from that post. If he does, more of his supporters will desert, and the odds on his impeachment will shorten dramatically. In other words, our constitutional protections are working. Now, Trump, this leader with authoritarian appetites, let’s call them, did get elected, and he still has a lot of support. So how can I argue that backing for democracy should remain strong? Because Trump  support for Trump is mainly an act of protest  not against the principles of democratic governance but against the performance of an entrenched and incompetent political class. Trump supporters consider themselves loyal to the Constitution. They made a bad choice, but it’s a serious misunderstanding to call a protest vote against the dysfunction of Washington, D.C. anti democratic. I see Brexit in much the same way. Support for taking the U.K. out of the European Union was a protest vote against the leakage of political power to an emerging new order lacking clear lines of democratic accountability. This steady erosion of sovereignty has been exaggerated by Brexit’s advocates. That’s true. But it’s real nonetheless. People feel a loss of control, and they want it back. Now, again, that decision was unwise, in my view. Brexit is going to cause the U.K. dearly. It was a reckless choice. But it was not a vote against democracy. It was a reckless vote in favor of democracy. At this point, supporters of this motion might be inclined to pivot. There’s no authoritarian tendency in Brexit. The vote to quit was passed by a majority in a legally sanctioned referendum. So, the charge can’t be that Brexit is antidemocratic. Instead, it’s deemed illiberal. And the evidence for that, Brexit supporters are disproportionately in favor of tighter restrictions on immigration. And with this, of course, the link to Trump is reestablished. It turns out  or so goes the argument  the real problem is bigotry and backwardness. Populism isn’t antidemocratic after all. It’s just the wrong kind of democratic. But this, I think, is another misunderstanding. The foundations of Western liberalism aren’t threatened by an argument over immigration policy any more than they’re threatened by any of the other disputes that democracies exist to mediate. I’m an immigrant myself with a vested interest in permissive immigration policies, but I recognize that the issue isn’t open and shut. High immigration can put some host country workers at a disadvantage, and abrupt surges of immigration do put systems and communities under stress. Liberal democracy should be able to have this debate without collapsing into moral panic about our declining commitment to democratic values. In times of great stress  and the past decade was that and then some  voters can lose trust in their leaders and put the wrong people in charge. They might even tell pollsters that democracy is no longer working for them. But here’s the key thing. Not for one second does that mean they want control taken out of their hands or the government to put itself above the law. Western democracy isn’t dying. I ask you to vote against the motion."

    "data": "Okay. I feel to disagree strongly with Clive. I’m going to tell you why Brexit, populism in continental Europe and Trump are against democracy. Democracy is not only the fact of voting. Democracy is not only the law of majority. To be a democracy means of course that there is a vote, but it means also a certain style of behavior, of consent, as you said, of values, a certain form of public debate, a certain way of believing in truth  exactly the opposite of what do all of those you mentioned. During the Brexit campaign, you had this incredible image of some debaters  Nigel Farage  pretending. Making some points. And just after the vote, in a very famous TV program, saying, Okay. I lied. I did not mean it. I know that it is true that it will  all the story with the health system and the European Commission. You have, in French  France, Marine Le Pen and all the populists, they don't give a shit about truth, about values, about creed. They don't even believe in fascist creeds. They don't believe in anything. They are pure cynicals, which is the opposite of democracy. And Donald Trump did even better. He decreed  he decided that truth does not exist any longer, that truth is exactly what fits him and that there is a posttruth, and alternative truth, alternative facts  which are what is convenient for him. So, this means that you cannot say that this rise of populist movements don't prove that there is a real threat on democracy. Now, there is other signs. For example, if we try to take a point of view a little broader  what happened in Greece today  Greece, as you know, and as my friend and partner Yascha knows better than me  I was such a bad partner; I'm sorry. Greece is the birthplace of democracy. And Greece  and democracy in Greece is dying now, at this  this since a few years. Number two, second side. In the last three, four years. I don't go decades into last years. Each time we saw people trying to embrace democracy, trying to join the club of democracy. So, democracy said, No thank you. Remain where you are. This is what happened with the Syrian democrats  when some people in Syria decided to oppose both the criminals from Bashar Al Assad's regime and ISIS. The democrats, they were said by the United States of America, by France, by Europe, No, thank you. Remember the red line which was crossed and with no consequences. Second example, Ukraine. You had in Ukraine  there recently a whole people with a big culture, saying We are European. We want to join the club of democracy. We want  we embrace your values. We said, You belong to the geo strategic space of Russia. And the last example  I'm just coming from there a few hours ago  Kurdistan. You have a valiant people who fight for the values of democracy, and we are abandoning these people in a shameful way. So, this is the sign of democracies who are  who no longer believe enough in themselves to be able to hear this appeal and this call. When you look at the map of the world  to last remark  who is on the rise today? Who is in progress? Some forces, some empires which we thought dead in the last years. There was a whole theory going from Toynbee and Spengler to Hobsbawm saying that they were on decline, they were dying. They are on the rise again  the Ottoman empire, the Russian empire, the Chinese empire. In a way, the dream of an Arab empire, embodied by AlQaeda yesterday and by Da'esh  by ISIS today. And you have last, but not least, Iran, which is becoming, again  which isrenoding, reconnecting itself with the dream of a Persian empire in all its area. So, this rise, this revival of the old nondemocratic empires, which we all believe to be in the grave, and who appear to be more vibrant than ever, this is another sign that democracy is not going well, that democracy is tired of itself, that the wind of history is alas no longer blowing in the sense of democracy, but in the sense of the enemies of democracy. And believe me  when I say that, I'm not preaching for a motion. I'm saying what I feel, what I believe in the depth of my heart. That's why I would like you to vote for Yascha."

    "data": "So, I could tell the story of change in the international order very differently than BernardHenri did, because in the 1970s, people said, Latin Americans don't care about democracy, right? They're too poor, their basic needs are what they're focused on. And now, look at Latin America, right? It's a continent of vibrant democracies. The Brazilians are refusing to stand for corruption in their government, which had been common for the entirety of Brazilian history. In the 1980s, people said, Africans don't care about democracy, right? And the African continent, while having suffered many setbacks  because in fact, the transition to democracy, the building of a social fabric, of civil society, and free media, and civic tolerance, and institutions of government that buffer against bad choices in the near term, and the consensual relations of how you are going to pass laws, enforce laws  these are difficult conversations for every society. And our society in the West is not excelling at them at the moment. I grant the other team that. But when we say we hold these truths to be selfevident, right, the people have rights and they loan them to governments in limited ways. We mean it when we're talking about ourselves. And yet, very often, we don't actually really believe in the universality of what we're saying, right? That Latin Americans want to be able to control their government, that Africans want to be able to control their government. In the 19  let's see  '70s, '80s  in the 1990s, there was the Asian values debate, right, that the people  the countries of Asia didn't care about democracy. They were worried about getting rich. Turns out that's not true either, right? People are agitating for the ability to control their government. In the 2000s, there was the question  oh, I left out Yugoslavia, right? That the  people of the Balkans didn't care about representative government, they didn't care about the ability to control their government. And now the discussion is about the Middle East. And yet, what have we seen in the Middle East? Not only, as you suggest, the people of the Kurdish regions of Iran, Syria, Turkey, and Iraq yearning for a government that feels representative to them. But the people of Iraq as well, the people of Iran  the 2009 Iranian parliamentary elections, in which they believed the government had stolen from the people the outcome. And that had to be put down by force  the peaceful protest marches. The peaceful protest marches you saw in Syria before the government began cracking down on them. People yearn for what we have the luxury of taking for granted. My response to the fact that, you know, these kids these days don't care about freedom and democracy, and they'd just  be just as happy to live in an autocracy  yeah. My nephews have the luxury of not knowing anything about World War II, and that's pretty wonderful that they have grown up in freedom so expansive that they can talk nonsense about what kind of government they would like to live under. But nobody's choosing to live under authoritarian governments, right? People aren't  Americans aren't emigrating to China, because, By God, what we would like is an efficient government that would have highspeed trains that work on time. We don't do that because democracy is messy, and slow, and we're almost always dissatisfied with the process, and we're almost always dissatisfied with the outcomes. But that's the point. We get to change the outcomes. That's a universal yearning  that every time people get the opportunity to choose it, they choose it. That is the expansive success of democracy in the West; that is, it is not just our democracy that is the measure of the success of democracy, but people in Argentina, people in Brazil, people in China who actually want a government that is responsive to clean air and safe baby milk demands. That’s what will bring the Chinese government down, right? Average people. All of us can identify ridiculous excesses in our politics. In fact, we have elected one president in our country. But the institutions are holding. Civic society is holding. The day President Trump issued his travel ban, the ACLU got 350,000 new members and raised $24 million. There are natural antibodies in democratic societies that get activated when our rights or our practices begin to be undercut. And the reason I believe that you should vote for our side of the argument is that it’s a vote in the ability of rejuvenation in democratic societies. We’re not good at having it right. We’re good at getting it right  right  by bits and pieces, by fits and starts, by doing it badly and then doing it a little bit better. That’s the success of democracy in our society."

    "data": "I think this is my one opportunity to feel like a model, is walking down that runway. So you’re going to vote on a single premise, but in fact there are two ideas in that premise, and one of them is you have to ask yourself the question just how broken is the system anyway. And my partner Robby Pearl and I agree that it is incredibly broken. If it were a patient, if the healthcare system were a patient, we would have put it in the ICU long ago. But the second thing you must decide is whether or not the reforms that are in place can revive that patient. And we agree again, Robby and I, it can’t. They can’t. It is in worse shape than our opponents are going to argue, and we think the reforms are less than adequate. So my job is to paint a picture of the system that is, and Robby will lay out a great system that could be, and what it will take to get there. Now I warn you the picture I’m going to paint isn’t very pretty, and some of you, especially those of you who work in organized salaried group practices like Mayo, like Kaiser, like Geisinger, may think I’m exaggerating. But you are islands of excellence in a sea of mediocrity, and out there it’s a bit of a warzone. We have fragmented care. We have burned out physicians and nurses. We have three  a quarter of a million patients die every year of errors, nosocomial infection, and adverse drug events. We’ve had a record number of drug recalls in the last decade, in part because we have an FDA that is a captive agency. It’s bought and paid for by the industry that it’s supposed to be regulating. We have  and don’t get me started on medical devices. We have tragic care for the elderly. We’ve almost killed primary care. And we’re still paying feeforservice even though we know that feeforservice rewards more care, not better care. It’s kind of like paying for a car based on the number of parts in the car. And we still do not have universal coverage. Meanwhile costs are out of control. They're out of control because prices are out of control. And it's not just drug companies that are the problem. It's that everybody is charging what the market will bear. Costs are also out of control because of how much we waste on fraud, on administration, on inefficiency, and on my special interest overtreatment. We spend about $300 billion a year on services that patients don't need. And when you add it all up the waste is about $1 trillion, $1 trillion. So costs are also out of control because we have massively overinvested in the hospital sector and underinvested in primary care and community based care. It's because  and hospitals are now consolidating as fastest that they can in order to capture market share and drive up prices even higher. They are investing in technology and specialty care, not because that's good for the community, because it's good for their bottom line. So I'll give you an example. I live in Washington, D.C., and two hospitals have proton beam machines and two more are building them. Now this is a $100 million machine that has been shown to be effective  more effective than standard radiation therapy for a handful of cancers. At most we need one proton beam machine in Washington. In fact really we don't need any because we've got two in Baltimore which is 30 miles away. So hospitals are saying to heck with the evidence. If it's good for the bottom line we're going to invest. As long as we keep paying freeforservice, hospitals are going to be thinking more about margin than they are about mission. Now are ACOs going to rightsize our hospital sector? So in 2012 we had 32 pioneer ACOs. Today we have eight. The other 24 dropped out because they didn't like the risk. And you can't blame them. When most of your book of business is in feeforservice and a small part of it as risk it's like having one foot in two different canoes. So every one of these problems is fixable. But they should be seen not as isolated ailments. They're kind of  they're a kind of sepsis. They're systemic failures requiring systemic solutions. But the majority of actors out there, what Robby calls the legacy players, the hospitals, the drug companies, the AAMC, the device makers, the insurers, they aren't going to like systemic solutions very much. And they are resisting a lot of these solutions. And they won't fix the problems that exist until they have to. So hospitals bundle payments. They're not going to change hospital costs appreciably. They're going to  they're going to be an incentive to deliver more bundles. And then there's Medicare for all. Now I hate saying this as a cardcarrying Bernie supporter and a supporter of single payer. But if we do Medicare for all that just pays feeforservice or worse pays fee for service and has Medicare fees go up to what private pay we're in trouble. Now our opponents are going to give you examples of incredible care, fantastic primary care, fantastic  fantastic medical records. Many many wonderful innovations. But the problem is these are million dollar solutions to a trillion dollar problem. And they are not going to scale up. They are oneoffs. So given this I think that you have to vote in favor of the premise. The American healthcare system is terminally broken. Thank you."

    "data": "Everyone agrees that the US healthcare system is broken. There's $800 billion, $1 trillion of waste, at least $200 billion of unnecessary care, and $130 billion of inefficiently delivered care. The quality of the American healthcare system is not great almost no matter how you measure it, whether it's infant mortality, survival for acute myocardial infarctions. Even cancer treatments that we pound our chest on as being the best in the world. Childhood leukemia we're exceeded by Germany by four percentage points. Breast cancer France does better than us. We are generally underperforming. No doubt about it. But the key word in the proposition is terminally broken. Are we terminally broken? Are we beyond fixing? Now let me just say, Dr. Pearl there is a reconstructive surgeon. My partner, David Feinberg, is a child psychiatrist. I’m the only one who’s an expert in terminal. I’m an oncologist. And I will tell you, we are not terminally ill. Sick, but not terminally ill. If you go around the country, there are multiple points of light, much more than Shannon says, and not only reserved for places like Mayo Clinic, Geisinger, and Kaiser. There are many, many places. You go to Care More, which is a Medicare Advantage plan in South California, and has now branched out into Medicaid and other programs around the country in places like Tennessee and Iowa, they care for chronically ill elders, much sicker than the average Medicare patient, and they do phenomenally well. They have 45 percent fewer hospital admissions than Medicare  regular Medicare. Their readmission rate is, if you control for risk, 10 percent compared to Medicare’s average at 17 percent, and in their dialysis patients they have 85 percent fewer bed days. Just one example. If you go to a small group in Hawaii, they’ve addressed behavioral health problems by co locating a lot of psychologists in their offices. This is a 15person primary care group with a couple of surgeons and a couple obgyn doctors. For four days a week, they colocate psychologists in their practice, and they treat depression, anxiety, smoking cessation problems, insomnia, and even patients who are noncompliant with medical disorders, and have substantially improved their performance. Palliative care, another area where we have underperformed for many years. I’ve been studying it for 35 years. We now have interesting groups. A company  forprofit company based in Nashville, Tennessee, Aspire, that begins palliative care not in the last month or the last two weeks of life, but 12 months before they identify patients, send out a nurse to the home. And they’ve seen 25percent savings and keeping patients in their homes over that period of time. Hoag Orthopedic Institute, again, in Southern California, they have done performance measurement and transparency correct. They have looked at all their data. They’ve done time motion studies and got out every bit of inefficiency in their system. They flip ORs in 22 minutes. They have dropped their surgical site infection almost to the zero level. They publish all their results on outcomes, on the web, including patientreported outcomes of pain relief and getting back to activity, and they offer people  not just in Medicare but everywhere  a fixed payment for their service, and they publish it right on the web and you can get it for that price. These are but a handful of thousands of examples around the country. So how do we scale them? Well, let’s be honest. The key is behavior change  behavior change of doctors and behavior change of patients. How are we going to get doctors and hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home healthcare agencies and all the rest to change? We know. We have to change the financial and nonfinancial incentives. There is no disagreement between our side and the affirmative side, that we need to change off the feeforservice system. The feeforservice system rewards doctors for doing too much. I’m an oncologist. It rewards us for giving chemotherapy. The question is, can we move off the feeforservice system. We already are moving off the feeforservice system. Shannon downplayed the accountable care organizations. Actually, today there are 32 million Americans in ACOs through Medicare and commercial plans, and we know that the longer a group stays in the ACOs, until the fourth year, then they begin to see real transformation. Bundled payments. We’ve seen tremendous change in bundled payments, in creating efficiency, in bringing down the cost, and actually bringing down  making quality the same. We don’t sacrifice at all. We have Medicare bundles, we have private insurance bundles, and we have states like Arkansas and Tennessee introducing bundles broadly. They are going to expand because they actually bring returns relatively quickly. And most importantly, we have MACRA, which is a bill passed by  a bipartisan bill passed, and it is financially incentivizing doctors. Either they take these alternative payment methods, which moves them off feeforservice, or they have very, very high pay for performance up nine percent or down nine percent to actually improve quality, but also being responsible for the cost of care. Yes, we can transform the American system. It's not terminally ill. But we need to be careful about the timeline. We are not going to transform it overnight. It takes four years before you begin to see change and then ten years before change sets in. 2030 is the right timescale. This is not like flipping the switch. This is change over time of a $3.4 trillion industry. We are not terminally ill. We can save the American healthcare system."

    "data": "The American healthcare system is terminally broken. Shannon's told you the magnitude of the problems. And the solutions that exist are simply inadequate. I think of them as a patient with systemic infection from bacteria. Give it a couple of penicillin pills not powerful intravenous antibiotics. The reason is simple. What's in place today is a compromise, a political compromise to get the Congressional votes and to avoid the ire of the hospital systems, the health plan systems, and the drug industry. It is simply inadequate to be able to overcome the shortcomings  shortcomings that led to the premature death of my father. My father Jack Pearl was an amazing man. The son of two immigrant parents he worked his way through college and dental school. When World War II came around he could have stayed behind American lines. He volunteered for the 101st Airborne. Parachuted on Dday. He and his unit were captured by the Germans. He led a daring escape at night. Brokaw would call them the greatest generation. Later in life he developed a hemolytic anemia. He needed to have his spleen taken out. The operation went well. My brother and I  my brother's the chairman of anesthesia at Stanford  handpicked the doctors, the half in New York and the half in Florida where he lived for each six months of the year. They were excellent physicians. They all knew that after a splenectomy you're at much higher risk  much higher risk for infection called pneumococcus. They all knew that there was a vaccine that could have prevented the complications. But the ones in New York thought Florida gave it to him. Florida thought New York. Primary care though specialty care. Specialty  he never had it. He came out to visit my brother and me. Dinner at my house, with my brother's house in Palo Alto. Next morning at 5:00 my brother finds my dad on the floor unresponsive. Four days in the ICU. Three weeks in the hospital. He survives the admission but never the complications. The diagnosis? Pneumococcal septicemia. One of 200,000 people that year and every year including this year who will die from preventable medical errors. Embedded in a story is much that is wrong  much that is wrong with American medicine today. It is still paid. Ninetytwo percent of physicians get paid on a fee forservicebasis. They get rewarded for a splenectomy. They don't get rewarded for thinking about how they can make sure he got the vaccine that is needed. If we're going to address not just quality but also address cost we have to move from fee for service to capitation. It's difficult but anything less will be incomplete. Zeke talked about bundled payments. The evidence says in bundle payments costs come down on a unit basis but doctors do more. When hospitals and doctors consolidate what do we see happening? They don't use it to improve efficiency and effectiveness of care. No. They use it to raise the price by controlling the marketplace. And the alphabet soup of current Medicare, MACRA and MIPS and APMs, doctors don't even understand this. Yeah, they'll meet the bundle  the requirements to get paid but they will never change the way they provide care under the current rules. His doctors didn't have the information they needed. Every American needs to have the totality of the medical information available to every physician, hospital at every point of contact. It can be done. It's called ATMs. But it won't get done. Why is that? Because the people who manufacture and sell the electronic health records are not going to open up what's called APIs, the application processing software that's necessary for third party developers to come in, because they know it will break the stranglehold they have on those who have purchased the systems already. And we need to make sure we address the issue of drug prices. Drug costs are rising three times more rapidly than medical inflation, five times more rapidly than overall inflation. It used to be that drug companies spent all their money on R&D. That’s not happening anymore. A lot of them are simply acquiring competitors, creating monopolistic control of that marketplace. And as a consequence of doing that, they’re able to simply raise price. Just look at all the things that happened with EpiPen. And primary care. My father’s primary care physician was overwhelmed, as physicians are across the nation today in primary care. Twenty, 25, 30 patients being seen every single day. We talk about primary care, but we still train more specialists than primary care physicians. The 15minute has got to become a thing of the past. The changes that are happening, the Medicare changes are making the life of primary care worse. I asked a friend the other day, I said how come there are 80 separate measures to evaluate primary care performance. He said because that’s all the columns that exist on an Excel spreadsheet. There would be twice as many as they could have as many in place. The government needs to intervene in the drug world. They need to increase competition. The government needs to intervene and use Medicare to buy drugs on behalf of patients. Every other nation in the world does it. Our Congress has prohibited our government from accomplishing it. What we know today is that the American healthcare system is terminally broken. All the small fixes you heard about from Zeke will make a small degree. But oneoffs, people in one area will do it, but not another area. We’ve got to change all of American medicine, how it’s organized, how it’s reimbursed, how it is led, how it’s technologically supported. It is terminally ill. It does not have to be. I urge you to vote yes on the motion so that work can begin. Thank you very much."

    "data": "So this  I’m not a professional debater, so this may be suicide, but I’m going to start with disagreeing with Zeke, okay? So Zeke is an expert on terminal illness. But, hey, I’m a psychiatrist. I’m the expert on behavioral change. So let’s talk about behavioral change. We could fix every problem we have in healthcare immediately – 50 percent of the cost  if we ate right, we didn’t use illegal drugs, we drank alcohol in moderation, we wore our seatbelts, we didn’t shoot one another, and we prevented adverse childhood situations that we know we can prevent. Overnight, we fix the healthcare debate. And all we hear about  ACOs and MIPS and MACRA  that’s mumbo jumbo. And when  I’m sure that our opponents will tell you that the United States spends more on healthcare than most industrialized countries, and our outcomes aren’t as good. But that graph is actually misleading, because the United States spends the least amount on social services compared to those other countries. And when you combine social service spend and medical spend, we’re kind of just in the middle. So we have an option. We can either start spending as a country on social services, or it’s up to the healthcare system to fill that gap. So can it be done? Well, I would ask all of you in this audience  I mean, if you look at the graphs that they will talk about, if you have crushing chest pain right now, and that graph shows that it’s better for you to get care in Uruguay, are you not going to go across the street to the Mayo Clinic? So acute care in America is actually excellent. We’ve designed our system to do that. And I take really offense by what Robert says, because Robert represented an organization that has showed our country how to do this the right way. Kaiser Permanente, which starts in Oakland, California, Geisinger Health System, which starts in Danville, Pennsylvania, are examples that health care reform does not start in Washington, D.C. It starts in communities that are committed to the people that are living there, that understand the problems, and engage in creative, innovative solutions to make things better, so that every patient gets care that's compassionate, safe, dignified, and low cost. So we've done some things at Geisinger. We've sequenced 100,000 people's entire DNA for free. We look at their DNA, and about 4 percent of those people have medically actionable conditions that we could intervene with before the bad thing happens. And on those cases, there's probably about four first degree and second degree relatives that are also affected. So that's genetic code. It's health care is not just about getting to the doctor and getting to the hospital. It's understanding your genetic code and also your zip code. And what we looked at zip codes where we provide care, we have towns like Shamokin , Pennsylvania, where 80 percent of the kids are on subsidized lunch. The rates of diabetes are 1 in 4 to 1 in 5. Food insecure people with great health care through Geisinger still have measures of blood sugar that are out of control. Guess what happens when we bring those people in and we say to them, Here is food, fresh fruits, vegetables, lean meats, legumes. And if you're living in a motel, we've got spatulas for you, and we have microwaves and hot plates. We're going to teach you about your diabetes, and you're going to give you and your food  you and your family this food to eat. Every single patient has had a decrease in their hemoglobin A1C, in their blood pressure, in their weight. If this was a pill, it would be a multibillion dollar pill. We can use food as medicine. And it's a hundred percent  if a pill decreases your hemoglobin A1C by one point, it gets approved. We've seen patients have decreased in hemoglobin A1C of four or five points to the normal range. I think together communities can say, we're going to eliminate Type II diabetes. And Kaiser has been a star at this. They've been a star at making sure that every patient that comes in  when you go to the dermatologist at Kaiser and you check in, they say to you, Mr. Feinberg, we notice you haven't had your colonoscopy. Can we get that scheduled for you? They're closing care gaps on every single patient so these primary preventions are saving millions of lives. And they’ve published. Now, the question that Shannon says, are these just pilots, and can they scale? I got news for you. People call us, people call Kaiser every day. About 10 or 12years ago, we did the first heart surgery with a warranty. The New York Times said if you had a  the New York Times called it a warranty. If you had an infection or got readmitted, we didn't charge you extra money. Hey, guess what? Bundles  and we can debate whether they're good or bad  have now spread across the country. So I believe health care reform begins with the docs, the nurses, the patients, the moms, the brothers and sisters, the communities coming together, taking care of one another, scaling these great ideas and making sure that every patient gets the exact kind of care that you'd want for everyone in your family. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you for having me. I'm very excited to argue today for something I'm very passionate about, which is the power of video games for good. And I want to start with a personal story. Actually, you helped me by setting up the Peacemaker story. I came from Israel 12 years ago, and I lived in the United States since then. I came to Carnegie Mellon and I came after serving in the Israeli Army for five years. I was a captain in the Israeli Army, and the first project I took upon myself out of my passion for design and technology is to make a game about the Middle East. So, my Army experience certainly helped and inspired the choice. And together with a group of students at Carnegie Mellon we made a game that simulates the Middle East conflict in a very realistic way. We actually used real war footage in the game. And it was a lot about different perspectives because you could actually play either side, and it was also about our goal to generate empathy. The idea that if someone would play the other side you would understand better the situation. The game made quite a splash because it was 2007. The perception around video games was even more negative than today. And it was before Facebook, before mobile games, the picture of the gamer in the basement eating pizza, and we made the game about peace, you know, that you could actually reach a peaceful solution. And we got a lot of coverage in the media, anywhere you can think of. We got a lot community support and NGOs that embrace the game. And we had politicians who played it and lost in five minutes. And something that surprised us through the process was that we started hearing the same quote over and over again. And the quote was, I played your game for two hours, and now I understand the Middle East conflict better than watching the news for two years. Okay? So, I repeat, I played your game for two hours, and I understand the Middle East conflict better than watching the news or reading newspapers for two years. Kept hearing the same exact quote from different people, whether they're in Israel, the West Bank, or America. And we started to try to understand. That wasn't necessarily our goal. Our goal was about perspectives and understanding. So, we started to try to understand, how did this happen? And we did our own research. We did  partnered with others and did research, with Carnegie Mellon and outside. And we started to understand that where the game succeeded, in which traditional media fails, is connecting the dots for people. When we watch those hours and hours about the Middle East on TV  or about Iraq, for that matter, or about Afghanistan  we are watching a stream of linear events. We're very passive. And those events are isolated, and they don't necessarily come together to a big picture. What's happened with Peacemaker was that you made the decisions. You are the leader, you are in the position of power. You take an action, you see the consequence. You start to understand the deep loops of cause and effect. But it's not only about what you do. It's also about the other stakeholders in the conflict. So, people didn't only get smarter. They actually got an understanding of a very complex issue through Peacemaker. That changed my career, made me invest much more in this, and eventually get to Games for Change, and see games that improve all kinds of things. And I hope we'll talk about them today. Which brings me to  from this story to frame the debate, as we  Daphne and I sit. This is not a debate that we want to do around all games make us smarter. We are great believers in the power of design and the purpose. It's not like the flier that you see here, each kid that is going to play Space Invaders is going to become Einstein. That's not our debate. We want to argue that video games are an incredible learning tool with tons of potential. This is what we're basically saying. I want to unpack the learning potential for a second. Number one, better understanding of complex issues and complex systems. This is what we did with Peacemaker at the time. Number two is make players  especially young players  better equipped for the 21st century playfield. And we're talking about 21st century skills, things like entrepreneurship, collaboration, problemsolving, systemthinking. Games are great in fostering some of those skills. Number three, making smarter decisions about our life. And here, Daphne and I will talk about things beyond education, because when you make smarter decisions about your life and health, you can actually prevent a medical condition or fight the medical condition, and maybe even live longer. We're not going to ignore risks. Daphne and I will be the first to admit that are risks  especially if you play video games in excess. But we want to also talk about ways to address it, you know? We don't want to ignore it. We want to, you know, find better ways to deal with it. And what my teammate Daphne will do in her statement, coming after me, is to dive even deeper into her research and research by others and give you the evidence. You know, I made some broad claims here. And we'll get deeper into the evidence later. In summary, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote yes for this motion. I want you to vote yes, that games are a great learning tool with tons of potential. In that sense, they have the potential to make us smarter. Thank you."

    "data": "It's hard to talk about psychological damages from technology without sounding seriously behind the times. After all, when TV first came around, people thought it would spell the end of civilization. Even before TV, when movies, the radio, novels in the 18th century first happened, there were naysayers who predicted worstpossible scenario outcomes. But I do think that the Internet and related technologies are different. Video games talk back to you. They reward you. They punish you. They're much more lifelike, especially if you consider something out of virtual reality. And, for that reason, they're easier to confuse with life itself and easier to get lost in and hooked on than some older technologies, perhaps. We know quite a bit more now than we did when the term, Internet addiction, was first coined almost 20 years ago, now. We know that these technologies can operate on the same pathways in the brain as substances of abuse and some addictive behaviors like gambling. We know that some  that, for some people, tolerance can set in, which is the need to play more and more of the same game to achieve the same kind of effect, or withdrawal which is this uncomfortable psychological, sometimes physical, state that a person feels when they try to log off. We know that, for some individuals, that their attachment to the virtual world can be so intense as to really interfere negatively in other crucial aspects in their life, socializing, relationships, academic performance, job performance, et cetera. Because of all this data over a couple of decades now, the American psychiatric association has included Internet Gaming Disorder as a condition for further research in its last addition of the DSM. The American Academy of Pediatrics also issued an advisory strictly curtailing and limiting the time that kids spend online. Now, there are many definitions for intelligence, the topic of our debate tonight. But, I think we can all agree that intimately linked technology  to intelligence, intimately linked to cognition are activities and functions such as attention, reading, writing, memory. And in all these  in all these spheres, technology has had an impact that's not necessarily positive. When it comes to attention, there are higher rates of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder being diagnosed. And a corollary to that is a huge increase in the number of prescriptions for stimulants that are being given by psychiatrists and mental health professionals. And people have connected that to the pervasiveness of some of the digital technologies that we're talking about. You might expect high rates of ADHD among kids and adolescents. But we see it in adults as well. I work in my practice with a lot of professionals, people that you would expect to be comfortable with dense, deep texts, lawyers, professors, et cetera. And they tell me that they have lost patience for complexity. And, indeed, it's hard to go from focusing for 20 seconds on a webpage to reading War and Peace. So, attention has been impacted. So, has writing. We write online and in our texting platforms in a way that's very different from the language that we learn to write. Somehow, we think that we can condense a complicated argument into a 140character Tweet, for instance. The contractions we use, the bitmojis  emojis is endlessly fascinating to linguists. However, they can interfere with language's purpose to communicate with precision and with nuance, specific states of mind and specific facts. Reading has been similarly transformed. Eye tracking experiments show that we very rarely actually read a webpage in its entirety. Instead, we take it in in a giant F shape where we look at the top horizontal band, another horizontal band slightly lower, and the left spine. Again, we don't read a webpage in its entirety. In fact, if you were reading an online transcript of this speech I'm giving, the chances are you would have logged off a while ago. So, our reading patterns are not consistent with deep immersion and online content. Memory has been similarly transformed. I work with medical students who constantly ask me without any hint of irony why is it that they have to memorize anything anymore when whatever nugget of information they're after, a treatment algorithm, complicated medication name, dosage range, it's never farther away than a click of a button on their cell phone. So, whether it's attention, memory, writing, reading, all these things had been transformed. Which is why when a statement such as the one we're debating tonight, that video games are actually making us more intelligent. For us to support statements like that, given this larger cognitive atmosphere and environment that we're functioning in, for us to support a statement like that, the quality of the research has to be beyond reproach because there's so much at stake and simply the studies aren't there yet. They're too small, too shortterm, too nonrepresentative of the totality of humanity currently online for this statement to be accurate. So, for that reason, I urge you to vote no on the motion. I also urge you to consider the opportunity cost. The activities that we are not spending time on as we spend hours upon hours playing video games, and ask yourself whether these activities are not also important for our intelligence and for being wellrounded, wellgrounded human beings."

    "data": "I'm glad to see so many of you tonight. So, you heard, I'm not a gamer. Video games have actually earned my respect in the context of my work as a scientist. I'm studying brain plasticity and learning. That is, I'm studying how the brain adapts and reorganize in the face of changes in experience. For very long time, I've actually been working with people that are born deaf and looking at how the lack of addition changes the way that the brain develops. One of the main finding from that work is that there are deep changes in how attention works. Now it's  in this context that a young undergraduate, Sean Green [spelled phonetically], and myself, made a chance discovery. What happened is that we had a number of computerized tests of attention in the lab and we noticed that Sean and his friends were really, really good at those tests. These are kind of computerized Where's Waldo tests. And we couldn't really understand it for a while. And, as it happens, we realized that Shawn and his friends were all part of the same video game club at the University of Rochester here in upstate New York. It was in year 2000. So, those guys were meeting three or four times a week to play first person or third person shooter game, Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Team Fortress, Unreal Tournament, and we wondered, could it be the case that playing such mindnumbing games had such profound effects on something we all value, which is attention control, this ability that we have to focus on the task at hand and to ignore sources of distraction. So, this really set up 17 years of research  17 years of research I'm trying to summarize for you in three minutes. And so, because we have 17 years of research we can actually not cherry pick studies here and there, but rather look at all of them together. The first finding that I want to report is that when we look at those people that decide to play those action games versus people that don't play, we do see benefits in cognition. We do see benefits in attention control like Shawn and his friends show. These are moderate effect sizes that are quite significant. Now it's nice, but it's not really what we are after. What we are after, because I'm interested in brain plasticity in learning is asking can I take any of you here, like a young adult, force you to play an action video game and change your attentional control for the better? So, this is actually where randomized control studies come in and you're going to hear more I'm sure from my colleague, Wally Boot. Here in the case of this study, we have 17 years of study  studies from our lab and lab of others so that's more than 2,000 participants. Some participants were asked to play those action video games. Other participants were asked to play control game, also entertainment games like social simulation games. And what we showed is that those individuals that are asked to play the action game, improved more in their cognition than those asked to play the control game. And there were change again in attention control for the better. Now, I know some of you in the audience are going to say, Oh, boy. Like, what kind of news are you giving us? What do I tell my kids if they come to me and say, 'Look, Mom and dad, Professor Bavelier said I can play as much as I want because it's good for my brains.' So, as good news for you  those of you who are parents  what you should tell your kid is to go and read the method section of our papers. Okay, granted, it's a little bit difficult. But really, learning with video games is not different than learning with any other media. That means small distributed practice. So, what we recommend to get the effects that we see is about 30 minutes per day, four to five days a week, for a period of about 10 to 12 weeks. And this way, you can see durable changes are still there, like a few months later. So, no reason for binging. And in fact, there is even data in the literature that suggests that massing practice with video games, like with any learning, is counterproductive. Now, I'd like to just close by making you realize, I just took a very, very deep dive into my area of research, but there are many other like researchers that are working on how we can leverage the power of video games for the better, with application  either clinical application insights or educational application insights. There's new journals  like Game for Health that have been created. There's a lot of American campuses that are creating new gaming departments, where the best and the brightest students are actually flocking. And we need that, because as Asi said, designing games for change  for impact, is actually a difficult challenge. And so, in the sense that that Asi and I want tonight to put forward to you the motion that games have an amazing potential as learning tools. We shouldn't turn our backs on the problems, but we should certainly leverage the media for what it has to offer, in terms of being a facilitator of teaching and learning  of preparation for future learning, some of my colleagues like to say. And that it's in this sense that video games will make us smarter. Thank you so much for your attention."

    "data": "Thank you. So, we like to think and often readily believe that the things we enjoy are good for us  chocolate. Sure, I could believe that. Red wine, even better.    [laughter]    And now, there's the popular notion that video games are good for us. They can improve our perceptual and cognitive abilities in fundamental and meaningful ways. Consumers spend millions of dollars each year on brain training video games. Why? Because they're ready to believe that the games will make them smarter, and companies are all too happy to capitalize on this belief. But maybe they're right. Maybe the games can make us smarter. Maybe the companies can make good on the promise of reversing agerelated cognitive decline. But what does the evidence show? Are they right? In 2014, a group of over 70 scientists with expertise in learning, skill acquisition, and neuroscience, published a consensus statement, led by teams at Stanford and the Montaponc [spelled phonetically] Institute. This consensus statement concluded that brain games do not provide a scientifically grounded way to improve cognitive functioning or to reverse cognitive decline associated with aging. So, in that sense, video games do not make us smarter. This consensus is consistent with over a century of research on how we learn. Video game effects depend on the assumption of raw transfer of training. The training on one task  in this case, a video game  can improve your performance of other tasks that you were not trained on. This is consistent with a now outdated notion that Latin training can improve your performance of other subjects. However, the most consistent pattern in the scientific literature is that this simply isn't the case. Training improves your performance of the tasks that you were trained on, and perhaps very similar tasks, but benefits not generalized beyond that. And it's unclear why video games would be an exception to this general rule. Given the lack of compelling evidence for broad training benefits, it’s not surprising that the Federal Trade Commission has been investigating the claims of brain game companies. Lumosity, one of the biggest brain training video game companies in the world, and one of the most heavily marketed was recently fined 50 million dollars for deceptive advertising. The FTC did not find compelling evidence that their games could support their claims that their games could make you smarter and improve your cognition, to make you a better athlete. They didn't find evidence for that, or it can improve your performance at school or at work. Some of these companies, but not all, cite peerreviewed studies to support their claims. The Stanford and the Mosspont [spelled phonetically] teams did not find this evidence convincing, nor did the FTC. When viewing the websites of these companies, it's important to consider not just the number of studies they cite, but the quality of those studies as well and what can be concluded from certain study designs. So, what evidence do the video game proponents cite to support their claims? Some studies compared the cognitive abilities of gamers to nongamers and conclude that video games make you smarter. Well, maybe, but that's not convincing evidence. It's like comparing basketball players to nonbasketball players and concluding that basketball makes you taller. Taller people are more likely to play basketball just as people with very good perceptual and cognitive abilities may be drawn to the games that utilize those abilities. Gameplay doesn't necessarily cause these superior abilities, it's a consequence of them. To conclude that gameplay causes improved cognitive abilities, intervention studies that randomly assign people to either receive video game training or not are necessary. Recently, a number of colleagues and I conducted a comprehensive review of the evidence at interventions including interventions involving commercial and custom video games can improve cognition. What we found, in general, was that the evidence was inconsistent. But, more importantly, what we found was that studies often utilized inappropriate control groups, inappropriate reporting practices, and also inappropriate statistical approaches that all biased results in favor of finding video game effects. Many studies do not adequately control for placebo effects. A placebo effect is an improvement not due to the treatment itself but because one expects to improve after reviving some kind of treatment. Some of the studies that we looked at compared video game training to a group that did nothing. Doing nothing is unlikely to generate any expectation of improvement. It would be like being in a drug trial and being randomly assigned to a group that didn't receive a drug. Would you expect to improve? Most likely not. Other studies use control groups that are much better, for example, the control groups used in action video games. This literature looks at action video games versus an active control group  a control group that does something. Typically, the control group that does something does Tetris training. What our research has shown is that people actually expect very little from Tetris training compared to fastpaced, attention demanding action video games. This is another case where expectations differ between the experimental and the control group and any difference there could equally be plausible  possibly caused by a placebo effect when expectations match the outcomes. People, including myself, enjoy playing video games. Are there benefits beyond that? I'm going to ask for your vote. I'm going to ask you to vote, No. I'm going to ask you to be skeptical of companies selling products to improve cognition. I'm going to ask you to be skeptical of effects that are so fundamentally different from how we know learning works. I'm going to ask you to be skeptical and demand better evidence and also better quality studies before concluding that video games can improve IQ or any other abilities. Just as we should be skeptical of getrichquick schemes, I also please urge you to ask  I ask you to be skeptical of getquick  getsmartquick schemes. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. Thanks, John. Thank you to Intelligence Squared for hosting this debate, and thanks to all of you for coming out on this rainy night. Rich and I come here to praise Walmart, but we're going to not spend much time on its obvious virtues like its corporate philanthropy, like its program for sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. Those are great things it does, but they're not why I nominated Walmart for the Nobel Peace Prize. And I was half serious about this too. In my column in the New York Times, I challenged readers to name any other organization that has done as much as Walmart to help the world's poor. I still haven't heard a plausible candidate. I mean, no one comes close to Walmart in combating poverty because it does two things. First, it saves customers a ton of money. It's estimated that it saves a typical American family about $2,500 a year. Now, to put that figure in perspective, that's about what a family on food stamps gets from the federal government. I mean, so this is a major antipoverty program here at home. Now, second, Walmart is the chief pipeline for redistributing wealth from rich countries to poor countries. If you're a subsistence farmer living on a dollar a day in Africa or Asia or Latin America, the surest way out of poverty is to take a job in a factory selling products to Western customers. You can multiply, quickly, your income by four, five, six times. For the first time in your life, you can afford electricity and running water. Now, since 1990 when Walmart became the largest retailer in America, the global rate of poverty has been cut by twothirds. That's the sharpest decline ever. More than a billion people have been lifted out of poverty. Now, that's one of the greatest miracles in human history. And Walmart played a leading role. So, the obvious question is, why isn't it more popular? You know, why do you hear so many terrible things about Walmart? Well, one reason is snobbery. A lot of people find Walmart tacky. Another reason is it's got deep pockets so it's a big target for trial lawyers. But the main reason is that Walmart has challenged some very vocal special interests. Newspapers don't like Walmart because it spends very little money on newspaper advertising. Local merchants don't like it because they don't want to match its prices. And most important, unions don't like Walmart because they're challenged by its competition. Now, as Rich is going to tell you shortly, the pay at Walmart is comparable to that at unionized stores. But there's one big difference. Walmart workers don't give part of their paychecks to a union. Union leaders want to keep those dues coming, and so do the politicians who get a share of those dues in the form of campaign contributions from unions. So, unions have funded a large campaign against Walmart. They funded Astroturf groups with paid activists who have led protests against Walmart, who stopped it from hoping here in New York City and in other places. They had a long PR campaign against Walmart, including a documentary that featured a story about a family business in Middlefield, Ohio, that was ruined by a new Walmart. It was a very  it was a heartbreaking story. You saw this family sadly closing its beloved hardware store. But the problem was, when I went to this town, I found that it was false. This hardware store actually closed before Walmart opened, and it was closed by mismanagement, not by Walmart. Another local businessman bought the building, opened a better hardware store, and he was doing just fine. And today, in that town, there is still a local hardware store competing with Walmart. So, don't believe all the propaganda you've heard against Walmart and don't assume that all its critics have pure motives. Some critics complain that Walmart sells too many foreign products. Now, as we saw during the presidential campaign, it's really easy to work up popular anger against foreign workers. But from a moral standpoint, if you're concerned about global income inequality, you shouldn't feel guilty shopping at Walmart. There's nothing wrong with sending your money to those workers. And if you're concerned about social justice here in America, consider what Walmart's been doing. Progressives used to worry about workers in small company towns whose paychecks disappeared every week because they were getting gauged at the company store. They used to worry about inner city families that had no access to stores selling healthy food at low prices. So, Walmart comes along to solve those problems and what's the reaction? Stop them before they discount again. Imagine if Republicans in Washington proposed slashing food stamp benefits to poor New Yorkers. There'd be outrage at their cruelty. But that's what Mayor de Blasio and the city council have done by refusing to let Walmart operate here. They're effectively taking money out of the pockets of the poorest families in New York. If you care about those families, if you care about all the people across America who have been helped by Walmart, all the people around the world, I hope you'll join us in supporting the resolution  long  and it is a revolution. Long live Walmart."

    "data": "I'm a researcher and I've worked on a lot of studies over the years on Walmart and its business model. But I was talking recently with someone who knows Walmart really well. Her name is Emma Raid, and she's been working at a Walmart in rural Pennsylvania for about six years. Emma has a lot of frustrations on the job, but she likes working with customers, and she's good at it. She works as a cashier, mans the customer service desk, works in auto sporting goods, selfcheckout, and hardware. She covers a lot of departments because her store is severely understaffed. And after six years, Emma Raid is paid $10.20 an hour, pretty much the same as workers who have been at Walmart for six months. Recently, she got a 40 cent raise and, at the same time, management started cutting back her hours so she was earning even less, making it difficult to keep up with her car payments. A million Walmart workers are in Emma Raid's position. Walmart's business model is pretty simple. The company pays its workers poverty wages. It offers few benefits and it manipulates workers' hours and understaffs its stores. That low wage business model serves one purpose. It's so the company can maximize profits that go to some of the wealthiest people on the planet. There's a growing gap in our country between the wealthiest few and everyone else. Our economy is really deeply out of balance and Walmart is at the center of that story. Consider wages. Let's take Walmart at their word, that they now pay their fulltime workers an average of $13.69 an hour. A fulltime worker at Walmart only gets 34 hours a week, so that's just over $24,000 a year. That's still below the poverty line for a family of four. And half of Walmart workers only work part time. Like Emma Raid, many of those part timers would like fulltime employment, but Walmart refuses that. Clearly, it's these 1.5 million U.S. workers at Walmart who feel the immediate effects of the lowwage business model. But it also takes a toll on all of us as taxpayers. Many Walmart workers sign up for Medicaid so they can go to the doctor. At the end of working a long shift, many Walmart workers still have to use food stamps so their kids don't go to bed hungry. They need it to get by, because however hard they work, Walmart wages aren't enough. A congressional report from 2013 found that a single 300employee Walmart Supercenter may cost taxpayers nearly $1.75 million every year. We're all  all of us in this room  underwriting Walmart's profits. And those profits widen the gap between the wealthiest few in our country and everyone else, pulling our economy further out of balance. I want to take a step back now and look at the other half of the inequality equation. Where do Walmart's profits go? Walmart netted $15 billion last year. Sam Walton's heirs still own about half of Walmart. These six billionaires are some of the wealthiest people in the world. So, on the one hand, the Walton heirs have inherited wealth that expands each year as the company pays dividends. On the other hand, the workers, like Emma Raid, who help generate that wealth, worry about holding onto the car that gets them to work every day. It doesn't have to be this way. Our economy thrives when people have money in their pockets to cover the basics, to keep the lights on, to make rent, and to spend their paychecks on groceries and new shoes for the kids. That money goes into our local economies to lift up and strengthen the entire community. You might hear tonight that Walmart's business model is just how it goes in the retail sector. But other retail companies have shown you can pay workers a living wage, offer good benefits, and fair schedules, and still turn a profit. I mentioned Costco earlier. They pay employees higher wages, offer good benefits and stable schedules, and Costco can still complete with Walmart's Sam's Club on price. We also will be hearing a lot tonight about Walmart's recent investments in its workforce. But the incentives for frontline managers to keep payroll costs down to a minimum haven't changed. The business model is still centered on paying workers as little as possible and offering as few benefits as possible. And so, if Walmart had made changes that gave workers a real chance at sharing in the prosperity they helped generate, you might find me on the other side of the stage tonight. But they haven't. The question we're grappling with tonight is Long Live Walmart. But Walmart's business model isn't worthy of a long life. It's a prime example of the inequality that keeps working people living on the edge of poverty  a business model that has funneled profits to the ultrawealthy, and a model that undercuts the fundamental promise of our country that hard work should pay off. My partner, Nelson Lichtenstein, will be talking about the negative impact Walmart has on its suppliers in the U.S. and overseas. And over the course of this debate, we'll demonstrate that Walmart's business model is driving poverty and inequality, and it doesn't deserve to live long. If you agree that there's a better, more equitable way to operate a business in this country, you should vote no, against the proposition."

    "data": "Well, we've been told that Walmart's oneandahalf million workers are treated rather shabbily, that Walmart could be  easily pay their workers much more. So, at one point Amy has said $5 an hour more  that it could  we've been argue  we can talk about that, and we will in just a minute. But first I want to talk about something that my partner John talked about. There are a millionandahalf workers at Walmart. There are more than 100 million people who buy the products of Walmart within the United States, much less those in the rest of the world, much less the ones that are producing goods for Walmart overseas. What can we say about them? Well, let's take Jason Furman. He's chair  he was chair of the Council of Economic advisors under President Obama. He summarized the literature on the impact of Walmart on consumer prices very nicely. And I quote, A range of studies has found that Walmart prices  Walmart's prices are 8 to 39 percent below the prices of its competitors. The single most careful economic study coauthored by the wellrespected MIT economist, Jerry Hausman, found that grocery sales by Walmart made consumers better off to the tune of 25 percent of food consumption. That's a couple thousand dollars to a poor family. Huge difference. And then he went on  and I quote again, The collateral damages from efforts to get Walmart to raise wages and benefits is way too enormous and damaging to working people and the economy for me to sit by idly and sing Kumbaya in the interest of progressive harmony. Now, not only has Walmart lifted many Americans out of poverty by providing goods at lower prices, it has done so by paying billions of dollars, at least $6 billion every year in federal income taxes, and more billions in sales and property taxes. Au contraire to Amy, I would say Walmart is  runs a private antipoverty program that actually benefits taxpayers. Now, there are arguments that Walmart puts  John mentioned this  puts established business out of  puts established firms out of business. That happens sometimes. But why? Does Walmart force people by gun point into their stores to buy? No. As Sam Walton himself once said, about a competitor that closed its door, that  actually, I got this quote from Nelson. You can't say we ran that guy out of business. His customer is the one who shut him down. They voted with their feet. So, that's the story of Walmart. Now, why can't Walmart pay the 800,000 or so of the lowest paid worker, say, another $5 an hour? Which at one point Amy calculated, and I think correctly, would cost only $6 billion. This is a $450 billion company, after all. But we're living a little bit in the past today, I must say. Walmart's profits are no longer 15 or 16 billion. Their newest statement came out show them around 13 1/2 billion. They have fallen 20 percent in the last four years. In fiscal year 2017, the company made less than 3 cents of profit on every dollar of sales. In the last four years, the Standard & Poor's industrial index has gone up enormously, almost 50 percent. Amazon stock has risen 250 percent. Walmart's stock is lower than it was four years ago. Amazon's total stock worth is double that of Walmart. Just as Walton revolutionized retail trade a couple generations ago, so Amazon is doing that today. Walmart is in a fight for survival, investing heavily in Internet sales expansion. To forego that investment to finance abovemarket wages, would eventually put the company out of business, hurting not only thousands of stockholders, thousands of workers, rather, and, by the way, stockholders, but millions of low and middle income customers who benefit from Walmart's low prices. Many of these people don't have computer access. They can't afford to start shopping on Amazon or with some of the critics of Walmart's, their favorite stores like Whole Foods. So, that's where we stand, folks. Walmart's a good company. Costco is in a different world. We can't even talk about Costco. They're the biggest seller of champagne in America. The people at Walmart don't buy champagne."

    "data": "Well, as Amy said, the  we have to be against the proposition which says, long live Walmart in its current state. Certainly, we aren't asking for the physical destruction of the company, but we want it to change its business model, change the way it does its business because Walmart today offloads so many social costs, costs that should be part of the company itself onto its workers, its suppliers, and U.S. taxpayers. This is true and this is particularly important because, in fact, as Richard just mentioned, Walmart is not unique. 40 years ago, it was a revolutionary force in retail, and I wrote about that in a book. But today it's a mature company. It's not  it's growing but not particularly fast. But  but it actually is setting the standards for the rest  all of retail, of which, by the way, in the current political moment, you know, bring back factories, there are more retail workers in the United States today than there are factory workers. In West Virginia, there are more Walmart workers than there are coal miners. So, this is a very important question, not just for Walmart, but for the rest of the country. And Walmart admits that. Walmart says that. In an advertisement of just a little while ago  a few years, they had a quote, an advertisement, says, Walmart saves the average family about $3,100 a year no matter where they shop. Save money, live better. Walmart. No matter where they shop? What they were saying there is that all of our innovations in logistics in suppliers, in the wage structure such as it is, have been adopted by our competitors. So, no matter where you shop, you go to Target, you're still going to save money over and against what it would have been 25 years ago before all these innovations took place. They aren't saying that Walmart is cheaper than, you know, Kroeger or Target, but that compared to what it would have been, if nothing had changed in American technology or law or labor relations or anything, then you save money. Well, that's the case with automobiles, with everything we buy, that things do get cheaper over time in part because of innovations that are there. I want to make just two points here. I think I have just time for  yeah. One is this, there's social costs, and they are  and John discussed this question of poverty. These social costs fall upon people that are supplying the goods that Walmart sells. And the most horrific example of this took place in Bangladesh four years ago when 1,138 people were killed in a factory that collapsed that was producing for Walmart as well as other Western suppliers. Now, why did that building collapse? Well, the approximate reason was it was poorly engineered. But the ultimate reason  and this has been agreed to by all those who've studied it  was that the firms that were in this building supplying Western retailers, and European as well, were under a tremendous squeeze. They were being squeezed week after week, year after year, to reduce prices, get stuff out on time, you know, and meet the standards of these companies. Now, yes, of course, people were being employed there, and I'll get to that in a second. But the squeeze meant that it's a kind of a pathology of the supply chain. And Walmart  Sam Walton, pride themselves, yes, we reduce those prices, reduce the costs every year, and we insist that our suppliers do that. One of the problems is, Walmart doesn't even know what some of those suppliers are because it doesn't care. Out of sight, out of mind. Just get the goods to us on time and under budget. Now, the  of course, these workers had flooded into Dhaka, they flooded into coastal China. Yes, there has been tremendous poverty reduction  and here I agree with you  by the industrialization of the  of East Asia. But we never measure, in the United States or anywhere else, our progress in terms of how far we are above abject poverty. If that were the case, let's go home. You know, yes, of course, we're much better than we used to be. What we measure is by how much those people who are doing the work, where they're doing the work, whether they feel themselves aggrieved, whether they think there is possibility for a more equitable sharing of the wealth, whether it's in Asia or in the U.S., and along  and in terms of that, the answer's unquestionably, They do, because they've demonstrated it. There are 100,000 demonstrations and strikes in China every year. There was a general strike in Bangladesh after the collapse of this building. These workers, yes, they had jobs, but is it for us to say, You should be happy? They were unhappy. They made it clear. And I think that is something that Walmart and other western suppliers have not been sufficiently taken accountability for. Now, as a result of that collapse in Dhaka, a  the ILO and others set up a system of legal accountability and about 200 firms signed on to that, mainly European. Walmart, most notably, did not. And I think it didn't because it did not want to take responsibility for what it was doing in East Asia. One more point I'll make just before my time is up, this question, yes, Walmart does reduce prices. No doubt about it. But the  and that's been going on since 1970, so, say about 20 percent of your budget of a workingclass family you can buy at Walmart, food, you know, clothing, et cetera. If you agree with us that if Walmart changed its wage structure higher, other people would have higher wages as well. Then, those workers who are  would get more money and, yes, they save money at Walmart, good thing, but they can also spend those higher wages on health care, education, transportation, mortgages, and all those other things that eat up the rest of the budget. And you can't buy them at Walmart, but higher wages will. Thank you."

    "data": "So, let me explain how I came to see the power of a universal basic income, offer a specific proposal, while Charles discusses its role in restoring choice and responsibility. Making it clear why a yes vote is really the only viable choice. At 22, my first real job was a welfare worker, determining eligibility for President Nixon's welfare programs. If you had a problem as a client, I had a regulation and a hoop you could jump through. I had no idea that two years earlier, the same President Nixon, with Milton Friedman's assistance, had proposed a far more radical safety net, a guaranteed income that'd be worth over $10,000 for each person today. Friedman explained, We should replace the ragbag of specific welfare programs with a single comprehensive program of income supplements in cash, and do more efficiently and humanely what our present system does so inefficiently and inhumanely. John Kenneth Galbraith and a thousand other economists echoed Friedman. They wrote, The answer for poverty is pretty clear. Everyone should be guaranteed a decent basic income. And only a year earlier, Martin Luther King had condemned President Johnson’s piecemeal approach to the war on poverty, saying, I'm now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective. The solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by the guaranteed income. He said, The dignity of the individual flourished when decisions concerning his life are in his own hands. With so many people living in poverty, despite over 100 cash transfer programs, and the inhumanity of today's bureaucracy would be reason enough to institute a basic income as the new safety net. But there are two more even compelling reasons. First, despite all the touted job growth, and low employment rates, November's election was a shocking warning that the 21st century has gotten off, economically, to a really bad start. 47 percent of Americans couldn't find $400 for an unexpected expense. Nearly half are stuck in jobs that make less than $15 an hour. 40 percent perform unstable contingent work. A 30year old's chances of earning more than their parents are down 40 percent, and the number of people engaged in any paid employment is at the lowest level in decades. A mere 34 percent of Americans feel financially secure. The rest feel, this is the United States of anxiety. So, secondly, a universal basic income, in this new age of insecurity, could be both a shock absorber and a supplement to work. Finally, accelerating technology may create the greatest disruption to jobs in history, and the Obama administration reports that 83 percent of the jobs paying less than $20 an hour, onethird of the jobs paying $40 an hour  that's $80,000 a year  are going to be impacted. Oxford University,:47 percent of all American jobs will be lost. McKinsey: 45 percent of all tasks can be automated. And add to this chorus of disruptive technology the voices of the World Bank, the ILO, Joe Stiglitz, Elon Musk, Robert Reich, and Robin Chase. The first major disruption may actually be selfdriving trucks. The largest job in 29 states, employing over 7 million people. Some may argue that we  Charles and I, the new 21st century Luddites, but as the chair of the Bank of England makes clear, every technological revolution  every single one, mercilessly destroys jobs well before the new ones emerge. So, how could a basic income work after a possible phasein? Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 8255 Greensboro Dr. Suite C100 (703) 2439696 McLean, VA 22102 I propose that every citizen, 18 to 64, would have electronically deposited into their account a thousand dollars a month. That's $12,000 a year. No strings attached. It's that simple. According to government statistics that $12,000 ends poverty for the first time for 43 million people. It would allow entrepreneurs to start a business, women to escape domestic violence, or finally be compensated for their care giving jobs. Workers could be retrained or not accept poorly paid or irregularly scheduled work. Students could pay for books and fees while prisoners could survive once released. And if these payments only go to citizens 18 to 64 and seniors receiving less than $1,000 a month in Social Security, then by a combination of eliminating current welfare programs, not all but some, eliminating tax expenditures, not all but some, not health care or not disability benefits, and if we add new revenue whether it be a board or a vat, a carbon, or even Bill Gates robot tax and claw back the money from people at higher incomes, we can afford to do this in America. The universal basic income is supported across the political ideologies because it's a fix  efficient and flexible and humane and can end poverty once and for all. It promotes choice and freedom and offers security for the first time, both now and during the upcoming disruptive technological challenges we will face. A universal basic income is the safety net of the future and I urge you to vote yes. Thanks."

    "data": "Thank you. So, it's terrific to be here today and I'm particularly pleased to be in dialogue and debate with people who, especially in Andy's case, I very much share their goals and I share much of their diagnosis of the problem. I don't want to be here as the defender of the status quo, tell you everything's perfect in our economy, or that all of our public programs are working. Certainly, we need improvements; certainly, we need reforms. The argument that Jared and I are going to make is that universal basic income is based on a faulty premise, would take us in the wrong direction, and would make many of the problems that Andy is so rightly worried about even worse. Let me begin with the premise. Much of the premise for universal basic income is the notion that robots will take all of our jobs, and that if we can't be employed, that we'll need something else, some money from the government to take care of us. People have thought this for a really long time. In the 19th Century, 70 percent of our population worked on farms making the food that we needed to eat. If you had told them that almost 150 years later, almost all of them would not need to work on the farms, less than 2 percent of our population could feed us, they would've wondered where all the jobs could come from. Today, machines do 90 percent of what workers could do 100 years ago, and yet the unemployment rate is a little bit below 5 percent just like the employment rate was in the year 1900. Switzerland has a much higher employment rate than Italy. That isn't because there's lots of robots in Italy doing everyone's job and Switzerland people build the cuckoo clocks by hand. As people get richer, it creates new jobs that you never could've imagined in the 19th Century. It makes people want to spend more and support even more jobs, and consistently people have said just around the corner there's going to be a disruption and yet we're currently in the longest streak of job creation that we've ever seen in this country's history. Second, regardless of your views on this question of the future of work, the numbers in the UBI proposals tend to sound really, really attractive. They just have one downside. They violate the laws of arithmetic. Do not accept this idea unless you understand what the tradeoffs are. It's really quite simple. If you give somebody a dollar, that dollar has to come from somewhere. It has to come from cutting benefits that someone is getting or raising taxes on someone. Now, maybe we’ll hear a little bit about all the bureaucracy that administers all these programs, but you could get rid of all that bureaucracy for unemployment insurance, food stamps, housing vouchers and the like, and only have $150 per person for UBI. So, if you want $10,000, you need to find the other $9,850. To put some scales on these proposals, Andy’s proposal that he just outlined will cost about $1.8 trillion. Charles has a proposal that’s a bit different that would also cost about $1.8 trillion. That’s twice what we spend on Social Security, our largest government program right now. That is more than we collect in income taxes every year. So, you would have to double your income taxes. You would have to eliminate Social Security twice, or if you’re not touching Social Security, take all of the income support programs  there’s 300 billion of them a year  you can’t pay for $1.8 trillion for $300 billion a year. So, if you are tempted to support this motion, make sure you understand who the losers are, because you’re redistributing money that creates an equal number of winners as it does losers, because it’s just a dollar from here needs to come from there. In most of the proposals, the losers tend to be households with more children lose  get a cut relative to a household without children, because today we support you based on your number or children. Or, older households, in Charles’ plan, a 90yearold would lose relative to a 45yearold, who would gain. Or, somebody who’s unemployed, which is something we support quite strongly now with unemployment insurance, would lose, and somebody who is employed and went to college would gain. Or, somebody who makes $90,000 a year would win. They would get a better deal than they get today. And somebody who makes $30,000 a year would lose. Again, these details can change. We’re going to hear this isn’t true because of that. That’s not true because of that. But unless you’ve heard who’s winning, who’s losing and you understand the rationale for it, you shouldn’t support the motion. The final thing I would say is, we do need changes in our programs. We need to build on what works. We need to end what doesn’t work. And in particular, we need to support and encourage work, because while there will be jobs in the future, I don’t think it’s automatic that people can get them, and helping connect people to jobs, helping them work, helping fulfill their meaning and get an income is the most important thing for us to do."

    "data": "I’m going to engage along with Andy during the discussion period of a lot of the issues that Jason just raised, but I want to spend my time talking about some of the things that would be accomplished if we had a universal basic income. If we’ve learned anything over the last couple of years, and especially in 2016, it is that the working class in this country has a lot of problems. They are not just in urban areas, they’re not limited to any one race, they’re all over the country. And these problems are ones that I think a UBI can deal with as the current system cannot possibly deal with. And I want to start out with the example of people who are doing everything right but are lowincome. Let’s say we’re talking about a married couple with children. They’re near the minimum wage. Let’s say they each bring in $14,000 a year. That’s $28,000 for the two of them. They’re good parents. They are good neighbors. But they’re also just scraping by. Under the current system, do they get any welfare benefits? Yeah, they do. But at $28,000, a lot of those have been phased out, and also depends where you live in the country is what the other benefits are, and a lot of those benefits are inkind benefits, as opposed to cash. In the case of Andy’s plan  which, by the way, for purposes of this debate, we’re going with Andy’s plan, both of us are. In terms of Andy’s plan, this couple now has $52,000 per year cash. That means that they are no longer having to rent a place which has Section 8 housing. They can go out and buy  rent an apartment anywhere they want to that they can afford. It means that they are not giving out food stamps to the cashier at the grocery store. They're pulling cash out of their pocket. It means that they are not supplicating the welfare bureaucracy to please enroll them in this program, and please don't kick them off that program. They are able to have a qualitatively different life. In material terms, yes, but also in terms of the independence and options. They are moving toward  basically approaching a middleclass income. There are millions of such people in this country. They deserve to have that kind of life. We can afford to give it to them, and just doing that alone would be great. Now let me sort of go to the other extreme, and the ways in which a universal basic income gives moral agency, whether people want it or not. Let's think of the guy who is your complete screwup. He drinks too much, he can't hold on to a job, and he runs out of money 10 days before the end of the month. Well, under the UBI, he can no longer plead helplessness. His friends and his relatives can say to him, as they cannot say now, Okay, we aren't going to let you starve, but You've got to get your act together, and don't tell us there's nothing you can do, because we know you've got a thousand bucks hitting your bank account next month. You got  you've got to start dealing with your problems. That's good. That kind of interaction, multiplied millions of times around the country, is having friends and relatives deal with human needs in ways that bureaucracies inherently are unable to deal with them. You have a situation whereby a guy who is living with his girlfriend is suddenly told, when the UBI is in effect, he's got to start paying part of the rent. Well, that's good for him, and it's good for her. You have other guys who have fathered children and walked away from them, and we really can't do much about it now with our child support laws, because the guy could say, I don't have any money. Well, under the UBI, guess what? That money is deducted by court order before he ever sees it, as it goes into the account. That's good for the child. That's good for the mother, and that's good for the guy, and it's really good for all the guy's friends, who take notice of what's going on. But I don't want to go too far with getting people to shape up, giving people moral agency  because they do, in fact, have resources and can take on responsibility. I really want to focus and elaborate in the rest of the debate on all the ways in which the UBI gives people options. So, let's go back to marriage again. You have the guy making $14,000 a year. He wants to marry his girlfriend. Getting married with that little money is a problem. Now, with the UBI, they will have a family income of $39,000, if I'm  39, 38, I have to add it up  even if his wife does not work at all. That makes marriage a possibility in a way it wasn't before. Or think of a woman who's married to a guy and they have a joint income. They both work, and they earn 60 or $70,000 a year. They're middle class, but she can't afford to do what she wants to do when she has a baby, which is to spend a couple of years with the baby. An awful lot of affluent women on the Upper West Side of New York who can make that choice and who have careers choose to stay at home with their children, which is good for the child. It's good for the mother. It's good for the dad. It's good for everybody. It's good for the community. Well, let's give middleclass women the kind of economic buffer whereby they can do the same thing. In all of these ways, we have possibilities with the universal basic income, of augmenting incomes by dollar amounts, yes, but what we are really augmenting is options. We are augmenting dignity, we are augmenting independence. We are augmenting human flourishing. I hope you will agree, these are goals that not only deserve our economic support, but our enthusiastic moral support. Thank you."

    "data": "I'm going to start by taking you back just about a decade ago, when the two of us were working for a new historic presidential administration. That was very exciting. In the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, that part was horrifying. These days, in a fact that poses a challenge to our opponent's end of work hypothesis, we're adding an average of 200,000 jobs per month, but back then we were shedding 700,000 jobs per month, over two million jobs lost in the first quarter. Why am I telling you about this? Because that recession threw 14 million additional people into poverty, 14 million people ended up poor. That's 5.5 million more people who lived  than live in New York City. This was between 2007 and 2010. But  and here's the first point I want to impart to you, once you account for the anti poverty programs  programs that lifted their income, their wages, that provided them with extra nutrition, with housing and with health care, the number of poor remained essentially flat. Even amidst the worst recession, I hope of any of our lifetimes, once you account for these interventions, poverty was essentially unchanged, even in the midst of the Great Recession. Now, the reason I'm underscoring this is if our opponent's UBI proposals had been in place this would not have occurred. And that's for one of two reasons. Either, the resources that we're now using to support antipoverty programs would be diluted as in Charles' plan, that's the universal part, or if you envision that we're somehow going to provide with a UBI on top of what we're now providing for them, you run head on into the constraints that Jason raised. The idea that you'd be spending the full amount of what our tax system already collects every year. The tax system needed to support a program that keeps the current safety net in place and builds a UBI on top of that is not one we should consider realistic, even in the context of this debate where I think we usefully suspend political disbelief to have a discussion in the age of Trump when conservatives are falling all over each other to cut taxes on rich people and cut spending for poor people. Resource constraints exist even in that world, and a dollar going to someone who doesn't really need it is a dollar that isn't going to someone who really does. Now, of course, UBI supporters from the right argue that the help that we're providing to poor and elderly people today, doesn't work. From Ronald Reagan to Paul Ryan, they say we fought a war on poverty and poverty won. Charles writes in his book, The welfare state produces its own destruction. But these claims are false. Back when Reagan first made that claim, the safety net listed 4 percent of the poor out of poverty. Today, it lifts 40 percent, more than 40 percent out of poverty, a 10fold increase. Today, our antipoverty programs, which UBI proposals, both those of Andy and Charles, would wholly or partially end lift 40 million people out of poverty, including eight million kids and 18 million elderly persons. And in a deep and important contradiction to this claim of the welfare system selfdestructing, we now have longterm research that shows that for children who benefit from poverty reduction, the benefits are long lasting. Poverty reduction that UBI would I fear undermine. Kids who get nutritional support were less likely to be obese, to have heart disease, to drop out of high school compared to kids who didn't. The Medicaid expansion was also  kids who benefited from the Medicaid expansion were less likely to drop out and more likely to finish college. A dollar spent on early childhood education results in roughly $8.60 of benefits to society, about half of which comes from increased earnings for children when they grow up. Now, those who know my work, and I hope some of you do, know that I spend a lot more time thinking about ways to improve this system I'm describing to you than I do touting and defending it. After all, even with all of the poverty reduction I've described, poverty rates are far too high. So, my work typically focuses on expanding the earned income tax credit and nutritional support. I’d seriously boost these upward mobility enhancers like quality preschool for little kids and college access for big kids. I'd make sure that unemployment insurance helps people longer, especially in places that get especially hard hit in recessions. I wouldn't guarantee everybody a basic income. I'd guarantee low and moderate income people a job. But if we instead choose to use our resources on people who don't need them, we won't be able to build on the progress we've made. Again, I understand and appreciate the usefulness of constraining political reality for this debate. But let me end my initial comments by relaxing that constraint, because there's little point in totally abstracting from reality. You know, Bob Greenstein, a poverty expert with whom I work, said any possibility of overcoming the obstacles to UBI will require a leftright coalition that has significant conservative support, and conservative support for UBI rests on an approach that will increase poverty rather than reduce it. I just don’t see how you implement the program, some aspects of which I like, that our opponents are touting without seriously hurting the poor. There’s no way to add a program closer to Andy’s, as he recognizes, without seriously raising taxes. And I’ve been in D.C. for almost 30 years and not only have I seen total unified resistance to tax increases among Republicans, I’ve seen too many Democrats buy into that as well. Unless our nation’s politics radically change, I’m sure the answer is the worstcase scenario. A UBI may well hurt the people who need help the most. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. I'm very pleased to be here. This is a great venue. I love the format for this debate, and the topic today is really critical, so I'm especially pleased to be here. As John noted earlier, I actually  I like charter schools. I like the idea. It's a good idea. When I look at legislation  most of it passed in the 1990s  we see common goals, common publiclyestablished objectives for charter schools. They've  the legislation says they're going to be small, locallyrun. They're going to be innovative and highly accountable. Charter schools  and the legislation notes that they're going to be missiondriven. They're going to create new professional opportunities for teachers. After all, Albert Shanker, the president of the AFT at the time, was a visionary founder. He came up with the idea of charter schools. So, it was supposed to create opportunities for teachers. So, that was wonderful too. Charter schools were going to be public schools, a new form of public schools  a compromise from private vouchers. And of course, charter schools were going to lift the publicschool system by competition and by example. So, this new form of public schools was going to help the overall system. So, I mean, I  maybe I should sit on the other side of the stage. I'm very impressed with the idea. My problem comes, however, with what has happened in the last 25 years. I've done a lot of evaluations, and public schools today are overrated in large part because they are not fulfilling those publiclyestablished goals. If we look at school size, charter schools are very big. They're growing every year in size. We have some charter schools that are over 10,000 students. One school in Ohio has more than 14,000 students. They're not locallyrun, today. Many of them used to be locally run, but today, increasingly, they are started by outside private companies and that  their proportion of the charter school market grows with every year. I want to talk  jump over a couple points here, but in terms of innovation, charter schools are not  I mean, some are innovative, but the systematic research has shown that charter schools, on the whole, have innovations that, in terms of nature and scale and scope are not different from traditional public schools. So, on the whole, they're not innovative  although there are innovative public schools and charter schools, and they should be commended. But another objective was that they were going to  that they're going to create new professional opportunities for teachers, and that has not happened, unfortunately. Very high teacher attrition rates. One study had 40 percent of the new teachers coming into charter schools were living each year. That was a sixday study we did. When we looked at the reasons, it was teacher salaries, working conditions, and the teachers' perception that their schools were not able to fulfill their mission objectives or follow those missions. Those are the main predictors for why teachers are leaving. The biggest thing that we often see debated is student achievement. Charter schools were not supposed to perform similarly. They were supposed to outperform traditional public schools. Why would we create another public school  parallel school system that performs similarly? They were supposed to perform better. The evidence  you know, if we look at the body of evidence, there's over 80 rigorous studies of charter schools. Some are positive, some are negative  in favor of charter schools. I've done nine of those studies. Two favored charter schools  I remember Jeanne Allen and the Center for Education Reform praised us for our quality research. And a couple weeks later, we released our study on Pennsylvania. We were heavily criticized by the same organization because of our findings, but we call them as we see them. But, overall, across those 80 studies we see that there's really no difference in performance. A lot of talk has been made about  conveyed about this CREDO study out of Stanford. CREDO is a research center inside the Hoover Institution at Stanford. They've produced a number of studies, the comparison groups and the methods are criticized on both sides of this stage today they've been criticized and I have concerns about that. I guess the biggest concerns I have is when they try to equate these very small effect sizes sometimes favoring district schools, sometimes favoring charter schools, but they equate those to days of instruction and this is something our new secretary of education is being  is doing right now and that's ludicrous. The biggest study that  out there right now has been done by Mathematica. It was commissioned by the Bush administration. We don't see charter school advocates citing the study, largely because it's a most rigorous study to date taking students from waiting lists. These are the popular schools that volunteered and had large waiting lists. They were not normal charter schools. After tracking the students over multiple years, they found no significant differences between the two groups. On the whole, charter schools perform similarly. One other thing about charter schools is they were supposed to be public schools and this is something I do a lot of research on. Right now, we're working in the 15th edition of education management organization profiles. Today, we're looking at half  close to half the nation's public charter school students are enrolled in privately operated charter schools. In my own state of Michigan, 90 percent of our charter schools are owned and operated by private entities. Some are nonprofit in nature. Some are for  most are  80 percent are for profit. This is not  this was not anticipated  not anticipated at all. We're seeing charter schools today being bought and sold. How can you buy and sell a public school? This is something that's really happening, that’s reform. So, this is one of my biggest concerns. I'm going to touch on some of these issues because I want to follow up on these publicly established schools and it's kind of one of the themes I have and Julian is going to talk about some of the key principles that are critical for the debate, but just to sum things up. Charter schools have not lived up to the ideal and they're not pursuing this publicly establish objectives. I believe that the reform idea has been really taken from us by private interests pursuing ideological and profit motives. I want my charter school reform back. It feels like somebody has stolen that from us. This is the reason I'm sitting on this side of the stage tonight, and this is why  one of the reasons why I'm particularly sad to say that charter schools are overrated."

    "data": "Thank you, John. Thank you, Gary. It's good to be back in New York. In 1995, I was in New York working full time with a small nonprofit organization to help create a charter school. Now, put into context the state of New York did not have a charter school law at the time. The state of New Jersey, where I had a chance to do work, did not have one, but what I had in mind is something that I took from California in 1993. California was the second state in the nation to have a charter law behind Minnesota. Those two states had one thing in common, they allowed school teachers to create public schools because school teachers themselves said, We've got to find a unique way of freeing ourselves so that we can have schools to teach kids to raise achievement and to experiment. When we talk about charter schools, we forget the fact that it was created and pushed by teachers. After you move from California, then you had, you know, of course, Georgia and Massachusetts and other states. Then they allowed parents and nonprofits and others to create charter schools, but it was a parentled movement. It was also bipartisan. Take a look at the founding in Minnesota. It was Republicans and Democrats and white liberals from certain parts of MinneapolisSt. Paul, urban black Democrats who came together and said, Listen, we tried desegregation. We need to make a lot of moves there, but for a set of reasons it's not working for all kids. But they also realized that public school choice isn't about a publicschool monopoly. It's about having a public purpose for multiple kids, and they said, If we can empower teachers to create charters, then we should do so. Same thing in California. I speak to you about charter schools as a charter school founder. I was also a charter school authorizer. I can tell you that America's got some great charter schools and we have horrible charter schools. We have charter schools that should have never been opened. If they're bad charter schools, that is an accountability and an authorization problem, not a charter problem. If we have forprofit companies involved in charter schools and they're involved in malfeasance, that’s financial malfeasance, that's not a problem with forprofit companies. That's a problem with what I call forpimping. And forpimping isn't forprofit. We have people in the charter school movement who are in this movement to make money. Guess what, before you have charter schools, you have people in the publicschool system then and now making money. I got into this movement because I wanted to make sure that we advanced the Republic. 1787 in this city, we decided to sign the Northwest Ordinance and is something we don't talk about often. And it's said that religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary for good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged. Schools and the means of education. Schools are important and they take place in buildings. But the means of education is ubiquitous. It can take place in a building. And we have charter schools that are on the top floor of one school, bottom floor of another school. We have charter schools that have an entire school building. We have charter schools that are hybrid. Some classes are taking place in the school building. Some are taking place online. We have charter schools that are also totally virtual, the means of education. If you expect 50 million public school children in the United States who are in traditional public schools to get a great education, we should support. If we support the three million kids who are in 6,900 charter schools, we should support it. Find a social movement in the last 25 years where ordinary people have been given public money to do extraordinary things. It's happening through the charter school movement. In this last presidential debate, charter schools of course was part of the discussion. And there's a question about whether or not charter schools are going to destroy public education. 25 years later, we have charter schools in this city and charter schools are thriving, some well, some not so well. But I want to leave you with this. If you don't like public charter schools, then you must not like public school choice because if you like public school choice, you've got to like Magnet Schools. And Magnet Schools, in fact, preceded charter schools. If you like public school choice, then of course you have to like the specialty schools here in New York City where you actually have to take tests to get in where, in fact, you don't have to take tests to get into charter schools, where you have specialty schools that are for the gifted. Well, what about those who we found left behind? Charter schools are 25 years old. It's a step in the right direction to try to right the wrongs that we've had for centuries. It's March. This year, the U.S. Department of Education will turn 150 years old. It was a group of formally enslaved Africans who walked off slave plantations in the south who helped to create the concept of a free universal public education. In the north, you had something somewhat similar. As we celebrate 150 years of what the Department of Education can do and the role it has played in advancing public school choice, let us make sure that we include charter schools as part of the conversation. It's not going to solve all the problems, but it's also not the biggest problem. It's not going to serve all of our children, but all of our children are already not served by public schools. But what it will do is keep schools and the means of education moving ahead. And, as long as we do that, it will make the Republic stronger, will make democracy better, but more importantly, we will guarantee that our children will have a better future than we will because, if you look at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data, Germany and the United States are one of the two industrialized nations whose children may not do as well as we have. To let that happen would be to turn our back on the Constitution and the work we've done. Thank you."

    "data": "So, I think I'll know if my remarks are a success if these two young men in the front row don't yawn during my six minutes. So, I'm going to be watching you two. So, first, I would like to thank and honor my family and the educators in my career, my life, for this opportunity. Gary began our debate by arguing that charter schools have evolved and departed from their original intent. I'd like to build upon this principal argument. Let me begin by telling you a little bit about my approach  that will complement Gary's prior remarks. First, I will discuss the success and problem in the American education system. Then, I will discuss what evidence should be considered to embrace the motion under debate  that charters are overrated. There are now thousands of charter schools across the United States. While some are awful, and many are average, some of them are great. So, you're not going to hear us say tonight that every charter school is a problem, just as you're not going to hear Jeanne and Gerard say that every charter is perfect. You won't hear us say that every charter is imperfect. Even so, you will hear us say that charters are overrated, and ask you to embrace the idea that charter schools are in need of reform. I'd like to first begin with the problem. The system of public education in the United States includes some places that are excelling, and some that are struggling. Overall, the United States performs about the middle of the pack. However, there are some states that are knocking it out of the park. For example, in math and science, there are only four countries in the world that perform better than Massachusetts. New York, New Jersey  there's only five countries in the world that perform better than those two states. The NAEP test, which is the socalled pulse of the nation's achievement, has shown that the children of today are smarter than they've ever been before. In fact, our graduation rates are now higher than they've ever been. Our public education system deserves some credit for making this happen. We've made real progress. The key problem in our country is the inequality  the inequality between states, between districts, within schools, and within districts. Jeanne and Gerard have been very eloquent on this point over the years. Inequality as the status quo for poor children really is the shame of our nation. This is probably an area where we agree. Some have suggested that charters resolve these equities that persist in our society, and that charters, as President Trump said yesterday, are civil rights. Donald Trump and his Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, have said that choice equals civil rights. Gerard, as Trump's presidential transition team on education, has made this point. Jeanne has also defended the Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, for her approach to forprofit charters in Michigan as a civil rights remedy. In contrast, as noted recently by the civil rights organizations  the NAACP, the Journey for Justice, and the Movement for Black Lives  charter schools are far from a civil rights remedy. And let me make that case. Overall, their results mirror  and in many cases, underperform  traditional schools, the public schools that Jeanne and Gerard have consistently denounced as failing. In fact, in some important ways, by using approaches that limit or deny access to some of our must vulnerable students, many charter schools undermine the civil rights causes. In fact, it's the opposite of democracy. So, next, I'll take up the proposition that charters are a slam dunk for student achievement, and Gary spoke to this briefly. There are many wild claims out there about charter school performance. Many of them are rooted in what CREDO does. In fact, CREDO studies are not peer reviewed. And if you look very carefully at them, if you point to the most recent studies, you found that, well, African Americans perform eight thousandths of a standard deviation. Latinos, five hundredths of a standard deviation. What does that mean? These numbers are larger than zero, but you need a microscope to see them. Contrast that outcome with policy such as preK and class size reduction, which are far more unequivocal measures for student success. They have 400 to 1000 percent more statistical impact than charters. Thus, the performance of charter schools is overrated. And again, these are the best possible national results for charter supporters to point to. Our friends have previously discussed the right to have highquality schools. We exist. We agree. In California, for example, however, the ACLU found that onefifth of all schools had discriminatory policies, some requiring parent hours. If you could not volunteer those parent hours, then you can make a volunteer payment to that school. And so, what happens is charters can do the choosing if we don't hold them accountable. In essence, if charters are allowed to implement exclusionary policies they do the choosing instead of families. Furthermore, the charter industry often points to wait lists, but examinations of those wait lists show that they're unreliable and there's many duplications. In fact, I have been called from a charter wait list that I joined six or seven years ago, even recently. For these reasons, you should vote to support the notion that, Charter Schools are Overrated. By supporting this motion, you aren't saying that parents shouldn’t have a choice or that charters should be closed immediately or that there aren't any charter schools that are excellent. In fact, Gerard himself has said that he does not, Believe charter schools are perfect or above reproach. So, I submit to you voting that charter schools are currently overrated will simply demonstrate that you are aware that charter schools are an education reform that needs more work. Thank you."

What if I told you the average cost effectiveness advantage of charter schools was as much as 19 percentage points in reading and 17 percentage points in math on that very NAEP report that my colleague just referred to. And that based on that increase in NAEP scores in a charter school definitively on an objective test we can actually save a thousand dollars per student that could go into that kind of preK health care mental health and teacher support and educate more kids at the same time? Are those results overrated? I love quaint statements about how everything is great. I heard it all the time. Just today on the train I heard someone say but I like public schools. I like charter schools, but I had to move across the border from D.C. into Maryland to get a good school for my kids. Really? Well, is your choice not overrated? But charter schools are overrated? Let me ask you another question, is civil rights overrated? Wyatt T. Walker, Martin Luther King's aidedecamp, helped to start New York City's first charter school. It's the SisuluWalker charter school. Year after year after year, SisuluWalker charter school demonstrates growth above and beyond what any comparable kids attend in the area year after year have always beat that growth. Is fixing what's broken and expanding what works overrated? Wyatt T. Walker said if Martin Luther King, Jr., were alive today he would support charter schools. Should we sacrifice the millions of lives that went ahead of us to make sure that children who were most in need who need the equity that my partner talked about earlier don't get that equity simply because we have this nostalgic version of that school that we all experienced? We often forget that efficiencies in the schools we attended, we get older, or those our kids attended. Classes too big, too small, nerds, people who didn't seem to care about us, people who cared too much, Bueller? Our talents are overlooked, underutilized, mismatched. I'm not good in science. I'm not good in history. Why do I have to be in a big class? Why do I have to be in a small class? Not enough music. Too little indoors. Books that make no sense. Testing, testing, testing. Discrimination. Are parents overrated? Think about it. Three million students in charter schools today. Twentysix years now we're entering with charter schools. That means something like 20 million choices have been made since 1991 alone. Grandparents, foster parents, black, white, brown, liberal, conservative, nothing, poor, all of their opinions, all of their ideas overrated? Parents vote with their feet. They're surveyed year after year and their support surpasses 80 percent and yet, those students in the schools where those kids came from are on waiting lists because they want to follow, too. Why? It's not because we need to actually count on these average, huge studies like we're hearing about. There's actually no such thing as a study that will tell you that all charter schools do this way or all charter schools do that way. In fact, states like New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts don't have better test scores or assessments than every other state. They have higher income parents, better educated. And when we've put those better educated, higher income families and their  students of those families in a dataset for researchers to look at, they get all combined and squashed with all the poor black, brown, Latino, and working class folks that actually ends up lifting them. But when you disaggregate that data, something we've been able to do for the last 12 years, you see a much different picture. You don't see growth with those upper middle class, those more advantaged kids, those working poor. You don't see them, regardless of color, getting better and better. You actually see the proficiency of the best performing students in America going down. And, yet, at the same time, unless you have a choice to get out of a failing school system, like that in Philadelphia, which graduates in four years’ three percent of African American males, while Boys Latin Charter School graduates in four years  I'm sorry, college graduation, 50 percent of males, unless you pull them out, those kids don't stand a chance. Our system is broken, not our people. Is learning overrated? No, no, and no. Students go to charter schools not because it's one amorphous big thing or institution, but for the very purpose and reason that they started to begin with. It started with diversity, not doing better, choices over diverse learning environments because all of our kids learn differently, require differently. Gary, if you actually really believe that you were part of the charter school reform movement, I'm sorry, but I never saw you at our meetings, okay? And if you really believe that it's gone awry, then you must not have been paying attention to the purpose of charter schools. It was for individual parent options because we know our kids better than anyone else. And it was for educators to provide those options. And that is why charter schools are not only overrated, they are a majority better than any other institution we've had. They've lifted all votes, made all public schools better, and you are absolutely wrong. Vote, No, they are not overrated."

    "data": "Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. I'm very happy to be here and present the motion. I will argue that the U.S.Saudi relationship has indeed outlived its usefulness. In support of the motion I will cover the domestic and regional considerations, and my partner, Ambassador Mark Lagon, will cover the subsequently the international and global aspects of the bilateral relationship. Before I get started I'd like to make an important point. The domestic consideration that I will consider today cannot be discussed in isolation as some would have it, internal matters of for Saudi Arabia are not really for the country itself. We live in a global world and so many things are interconnected from terrorism to oil. We can't isolate the domestic from the international; however, we have a very good division of labor between the two of us and I will cover the first part of this debate and it deals with internal dynamics. So, one thing to remember is that whatever happens inside Saudi Arabia does not stay within the borders of Saudi Arabia and has implication for the U.S. and also for that matter the whole world. The U.S.Saudi relationship was dubbed from the very beginning as a special relationship. From the moment American President Roosevelt met King ibn Saud, the founder of Saudi Arabia on the 14th of February 1945. At the core of this relationship were two issues. First, oil and second one is security. The special relationship meant that the U.S. offered Saudi Arabia uncritical, unequivocal, and unconditional support for more than seven decades. We will argue that this is no longer in the U.S.'s best national interest. Let me just explain how this relationship developed. In the 1960s, Saudi Arabia was a very useful ally during the cold war. Its oil wealth, its strategic location  and believe it or not, its conservative Islamic tradition  all helped to defend against, and ultimately defeat, nationalism and communism, not only in the Arab world, but also in the Muslim world in general. This special relationship meant that Saudi Arabia became important for the U.S., and even more so, after 1979. So, why 1979? Remember, in 1979, the main ally of the U.S., the Shah of Iran, was toppled. And we get to the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. And at that moment, U.S.Iranian relations became extremely difficult and hostile. And in fact, they have never been resolved until the present day. It is still a troubled relationship. So, the U.S. decided to put all its baskets in the  all its eggs, sorry  in the Saudi basket. And therefore, this relationship became even more special. And we leave that moment to come to Afghanistan in the 1980s. And here, the U.S.Saudi alliance became extremely important. And also, Saudi Arabia used its conservative Islam in order to start what is regarded today as the menace  and the menace is the global jihadi movement that brewed in the caves of Afghanistan. But then it spread across the globe, and I do not need to remind you of the details. Today, this special relationship has become counterproductive. Unconditional U.S. support for this absolute monarchy is now against U.S. national interests. The absolute monarchy of Saudi Arabia has become difficult to sustain. First, this regime oppresses its own people, marginalizes women, discriminates against religious minorities, spreads lethal conservative religious ideology, interferes in domestic affairs of its neighbors, and aspires to become a hawkish regional superpower. This doesn't help U.S. interests, but actually harms them. Unconditional U.S. support legitimizes the regime and authoritarianism, and makes the U.S. vulnerable to accusations of double standards  supporting dictatorship in one country while promoting human rights and democracy in other countries. More than that  since 9/11, many Americans have asked legitimate questions. Given that 15 out of 19 hijackers were Saudis, Americans began to ask, Are Saudis our friends or foe? This was a legitimate question, given that Saudi Arabia spawned more than threequarters of the terrorists who perpetrated the most horrific acts against America in modern history."

    "data": "Thanks, everybody, for coming out. We're going to divide up the defense of this motion, not according to domestic and international, because we actually think that the whole point of this motion is about the value of this relationship to the United States. And so, we're going to focus on the value that Saudi Arabia and the relationship with Saudi Arabia brings. I'm going to talk about probably the most telling point that Madawi brought up, the two most telling points: Values and the spread of this very conservative xenophobic, intolerant version of Islam that we short handedly call Wahhabism. And Jim is going to talk more about American interests in strategy and in oil and in other elements. So it seems to me that if the argument's about values, they win, we walk off the stage. Saudi Arabia does not share our values. We are very happy to stipulate that. But the question here is not for us about values, it's about interests. If we ran our Middle East policy based only on dealing with people who shared our values, we really wouldn't have many people to talk to in the Middle East. The Middle East is a very strategic area. It's in flames right now. And having a relationship with a stable country in the Middle East that has influence in Syria, in Yemen, in other parts  in Iraq, in other parts of the Middle East that are in flames we think is actually very useful to the United States. But I think Madawi, my friend Madawi  and we've known each other for a long time. I think my friend Madawi's best argument here is the fact that Saudi Arabia has been the home of Wahhabism and that Wahhabism has become, in its various incarnations once it left the country, a threat to the United States. So there is a logic to this, undoubtedly. But I don't think that that logic holds through the entire argument. And let me tell you why. It's more complicated than that. It's nice to look for a single cause, for any phenomenon, particularly a troubling phenomenon like the Salafi jihadist movement in that alQaeda and ISIS, they're Salafi jihadists. That's what specialists call them. It's always nice to try to find the one silver bullet that's the cause for this, and then you can go against it. But I don't think that that's ever right, right? Salafi jihadism is the product of an enormous number of factors, and Madawi mentioned a very important one, the success of the jihad in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. That was supported by Saudi Arabia, also supported by the United States. You might remember President Reagan calling the leaders of this jihad, the mujahedeen. He compared them to the Founding Fathers of the United States, right? Lots of Saudis have joined ISIS, but lots of Tunisians have joined ISIS, Tunisia, the one success story of the Arab Spring, the most democratic of the Arab countries emerging from the Arab Spring. Europeans have joined ISIS, even some Americans. It's hard to say that Wahhabism was the thing that drove them to join ISIS. I think that the fact of the matter is the Saudis lost control of global Salafism, they lost control of Wahhabism once it left their borders. And in fact, these people in ISIS and alQaeda, who share some beliefs with Saudi Arabia about what Islam means, now want to kill the Saudis. And they identify Saudi regime as one of their major opponents. In fact, counterterrorism is, I think, one of the major reasons why we need to sustain our relationship with Saudi Arabia. Intelligence sharing is an important part of that. The Saudis, we know  right, we know that because of cooperation with the Saudis, there have been plots foiled. In 2010, a plot by alQaeda to ship explosives from Yemen to the United States in airplanes was foiled because of cooperation with Saudi Arabia. In 2015, because of cooperation with Saudi Arabia, the United States, and cooperating with Lebanese authorities, was able to arrest the mastermind behind the Khobar Towers bombing that killed Americans, Saudis, and others in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia back in 1996. So intelligence cooperation is part of this. But also an extremely important part of this cooperation with Saudi Arabia and sustaining that relationship with Saudi Arabia is not simply the intelligence sharing, it's also that we need the Saudis on the ideological front against ISIS and alQaeda. We, the United States, have no standing in those arguments in the Muslim world, right? We can say, this is bad, this is wrong. No one in the Muslim world listens to us. We're not a Muslim country. What the Saudis do, right, as difficult as it is for us good liberal Americans, who really excoriate the Saudis on all sorts of grounds about women's rights and political freedoms for very good reasons. What we cannot do is make the argument against alQaeda and ISIS within their own intellectual framework, and the Saudis can do that. And that's another reason, besides the kind of very, very practical intelligence sharing that we do with them  that's another reason the ideological fight against ISIS is best conducted from within the intellectual framework of Salafi Islam. And really, only the Saudis can conduct that fight. They are doing it. We have to press them to continue to do it, but I think that that makes them extremely important for the United States and argues for the sustaining of our relationship with Saudi Arabia."

    "data": "Thanks, John. Thanks, Intelligence Squared, for asking a good question, and thank you for coming. Professor AlRasheed and I are here to ask you to support the same position that we're arguing for, that a special, unconditional relationship with Saudi Arabia has outlived its utility. She's focused on some domestic and regional factors. I'm going to look at some more global ones and aspects of the bilateral relationship itself. First, United States does not need Saudi Arabia as much as it once did for oil. The relationship the United States had with Saudi Arabia began with oil, and it was premised from the 1973 oil embargo for a good while on access to oil. But due to technical  technological advances like fracking, the United States doesn't need Saudi oil as much. There was a decline of some 50 percent of Saudi oil exports to the United States from April to December of 2014 as a result. The Saudis know they need to change. The deputy crown prince has put forward an economic reform plan called Vision 2030 based on moving away from that dependence on oil. They depend on oil for 77 percent of their budget. That's compared to merely 33 percent for Iran. The Saudi government needs to simultaneously find a new source of economic growth and convince the United States that the relationship is about something more than oil. Now, some say, including probably our debate partners, that the United States should care about this because the Europeans and the world economy depend on oil. But for a number of reasons, the United States can remain an important military guarantor of stability and access to oil in the region without having an utterly unconditional relationship with Saudi Arabia. The likelihood of overthrow of the regime is not great. Our counterparts here in the debate will probably argue that it's a fairly stable regime. And there isn't reason to think that there's going to be major war teen the regional powers or even a bad actor like Iran wanting to cut off the oil supply entirely. Second argument: Unconditional backing undercuts U.S. global credibility. This is a government, for instance, that stones, lashes, beheads people. It's executed over 150 people each of the last two years without due process. And internationally, the Saudis have engaged in harming civilians terribly in their escapades in Yemen, killing some 6,000 people in Yemen in the initial months of intervening to try and change the government to be more to its liking there. There are now some 3 million people displaced in Yemen. At the same time as the United States is rightly criticizing Russia for harming civilians in Aleppo in Syria, it stands by Saudi Arabia and is selling massive weapons, 10 percent of U.S. arms sales go to Saudi Arabia. The Wahhabist world view that Greg Gause talked about has indeed been a pernicious factor. It has  as Hillary Clinton said in a memo quoted in WikiLeaks indicated, that donors in Saudi Arabia comes through the most significant source of funding, the Sunni terrorist groups worldwide. We've seen this impact in Southeast Asia and in western Africa villages. We've seen it in a $100 million going to extremist clerics in Pakistan from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with government support. We've seen it touching on Nigeria. We've seen it touching on Kosovo. Next argument. U.S. backing for Saudi Arabia leads to greater targeting of Americans. We help give birth to some of the worst extremists by working with Saudi Arabia to create jihadists to fight against the Soviets, perhaps in an elbow fight then, but they came to turn their eyes on the Saudi government and on the Americans from afar. It looks like even though there isn't a U.S. major deployment of troops anymore ever since Saddam Hussein was overthrown, that American presence is somewhat less in Saudi Arabia and still our association backing unconditionally that government of Saudi Arabia puts a bull’seye on the back of Americans because it's easier for extremists to fight Americans as the patrons of Saudi Arabia than to succeed in trying to overthrow the Saudi government right there. The Saudis engage in blackmail. If they really had the overlapping interests that our counterparts will argue that they had, they wouldn't regularly try to withhold intelligence sharing or threaten to stop buying our weapons or cooperating with us when, for instance, the Congress passes a law allowing American citizens with the families of 9/11 victims to sue the Saudi government. And that kind of leveraging happens with others. Sweden's Foreign Minister Margot Wallström had the temerity to note women's rights are horrific in Sweden and she was punished with being barred from talking at the Arab League with visas being withdrawn from Swedes. This is blackmail. It's worth noting that also Saudi Arabia threatened the U.N. if it pointed a finger at it in its annual report on children in armed conflicts for the mayhem that it has been conducting against children in Yemen threatening to cut off aid, including for Palestinian refugees. Don't buy that this unconditional relationship has to stand as it is. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you, John. Thank you all for coming. If there's one thing the recent presidential election showed is that it's a good thing to look at all of our assumptions and sunk cost ideas about foreign policy, domestic policy for that, and thus it's good to take a look at Saudi Arabia. Nonetheless, this motion as written is not only and I quote the moderator, John, verbose. It's also not very clear. If I were here tonight debating either we should stop defending South Korea or we should continue, I could give you an idea of exactly what that meant and some idea of the risks racking and stacking them. This is different because we're talking about a special relationship which has no real definition. As a diplomat I know what it feels like because I've done it in countries like Germany, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Korea, and a few other places that reached that level, but nonetheless, it is hard to pin down. But let me try to explain a little bit what a special relationship is and in particular what it isn't. Actually, I'll start with what it isn't. It isn't unconditional support. I don't know of a Saudi, and I've talked with most of the leaders, who would claim that Barak Obama gave Saudi Arabia unconditional support, but I would like to see the other side defend  the point that he did. Nonetheless, a special relationship continued. We managed to maintain a good relationship with Saudi Arabia despite major disputes over Yemen, major disputes over Iran, because that's what special relationships do. They don't mean you agree on everything and they certainly don't mean you like each other's domestic policies. What they mean is that they're important players in a construct internationally that you share. So, that takes us to the key question, and it's a very dramatic question right now with a new administration with very new ideas, what is our national interest. From then we can deduce whether Saudi Arabia fits into them. The Trump administration is going back and forth with a lot of rhetoric and lightning bolts between a somewhat more colorful version of what we've been doing since 1945, which is a global security  collective security system and a global order. On the other hand, some in the administration are pushing for a more muscular America First national interests approach, rather similar to what we saw  and it didn't work well  in the 19th century. But regardless of which way this administration goes, short of full isolationism, you're going to need friends and allies. We can't do whatever we want to do in the world alone. And that means we have to turn to countries that will help us. So, how does Saudi Arabia help us? Now, our colleagues gave us a wonderful example of how they helped us 20, 30 years ago. My first point is, they were certainly no more democratic or lovable then than they are now. In fact, on Mark’s scale, they would have been an 8, probably, 30 years ago  [laughs]  if we'd had an 8. But nonetheless, we managed to do a lot of very important things with them. We've got big business to do with them now. First, oil. Back when all this started, according to the other side, it was all about oil dependency, except back in the 1970s, we were in America only beginning to important major amounts of oil. The problem was not oil to America then, or for a while, and we did import a lot  including from Saudi Arabia  now, when we only import about 25 percent, and only a small part of that from Saudi Arabia. It's about oil to the world. And where does that come from? 25 percent of internationally traded oil comes from the region around Saudi Arabia, and it is the biggest swing producer. That means that Saudi decisions on oil have a huge impact on the international economy that we trade with and have a huge impact on the price of gasoline at your pump. We saw what happens when we get on the wrong side of Saudi Arabia on oil issues in 1974. That's a good example that close friends don't always support each other. The next things is, the threats we're facing in the region. It isn't quite the Cold War, I grant you, but between ISIS and Iran, we have really terrible problems. Have the Saudis killed inadvertently, to a large degree, 6,000 people in Yemen? I think that's a pretty accurate figure. The side they're struggling against, Iran and friends, have killed deliberately, as a policy, a hundred times that. Those are the kind of facts we have to deal with. It isn't a choice between who you'll take to the ball. You're not looking for a special partner, a special relationship  someone  a significant other for the rest of your life. This isn't a love affair. It's a question of transactional issues to accomplish common goals. Those common goals include fighting ISIS, fighting AlQaeda, and containing Iran in the area. And there, we need the Saudis. My opponents are absolutely right about the blackmail. But I'm here to tell you, I don't know of a major ally of ours who hasn't done similar blackmailing. And had I six more minutes, I would start with Turkey. Actually, I would probably end with Turkey. But I could throw in even the lovable Germans and some others that would surprise you. The Japanese and the Koreans, once. So  and as far as us being more in danger because of Saudi  as a guy who's had a bullseye on my back, literally, in the Middle East repeatedly, it's never been because of our relationship with Saudi Arabia. It's been from many other things. That's not the fault of the Saudis. Thank you very much. Vote against this bad, bad motion."

    "data": "Thank you all for joining us tonight for this very important discussion. My partner Clive and I ask you to vote in favor of our motion, to give Trump a chance. The question before us tonight requires your focused attention. Let's talk for a moment about what we're not debating. The question is not whether you personally voted for Donald Trump. This being Washington, D.C., I suspect if we ask for a show of hands most of the people in this room would've voted for Hillary Clinton. Nor is the question would you vote for Trump if the election were held today. For the same reason, I am confident of the answer to that question as well. Nor is the question whether you like the electoral college system or would change that system if you could do so tonight. The same answer for the same reason. Nor is the question whether you think that Donald Trump should be president right now. The fact is, that he is the current occupant of the Oval Office. Nor is the question whether you personally like Trump or his temperament or even if you think he's an admirable person. The question is not, do you like Trump? Given the sense of most of the people inside the beltway, that question here is also moot before we even begin tonight. The motion before you and the question we consider tonight is whether to give Trump a chance. Barack Obama insisted on getting a chance as a newly elected president. Elections have consequences, he said. I won. Giving Trump a chance simply means that we acknowledge what President Obama himself said, that elections have consequences, Trump won, and we can and we should be cleareyed and realistic about the fact that Donald Trump is president. Giving Trump a chance does not mean endorsing his stylistic approach or approving his policy initiatives, although we will be talking about his policies. Giving Trump a chance does not necessarily mean that you want his policies to succeed. Giving Trump a chance simply means that you're openminded enough to allow the new administration to do its job and to succeed or fail on its own terms. Ironically, the failure to give Trump a chance has largely fueled his success. Overtly adversarial media, overhyped predictions of calamity reflect  reflexive comparisons to autocracy, dictatorship, Watergate, Nazi Germany, these overthetop criticisms detract from the credibility of his critics and they reinforce Trump's popularity with those who elected him. My partner Clive is not a Trump supporter, yet he can see why we all should give Trump a Chance. In a few minutes, he's going to share his reasons why. Now, the premise of this debate is wrong. It's unlikely that our gracious hosts, Intelligence Squared, would've hosted this debate if Hillary Clinton had won the election. We did not have this debate when Barack Obama won the election and was reelected. For those who don't understand why many Americans want to give Trump a chance, let me share with you why I think that he will be a good president. Remember, you don't have to agree with me that he will be a good president in order to see why we should give him a chance. We're only asking you to support the tiniest of propositions, the tiniest of propositions to merely give him a chance. Now, Donald Trump has upended the established order of politics, media, and culture in America. I would say he poses an existential threat to the media and government's coziness. He may not have the marital history of most Republicans who typically appeal to mainstream Republicans and conservatives. Their surreptitious and welltimed release of the Access Hollywood secret audio certainly did not endear him to chivalrous men and women who care about respect and propriety. What does that say about his success? He was able to overcome these character flaws because he tapped into the issues and the patriotism of his fellow Americans. Where we had previously selected presidents from the ranks of the political elite, the voters decided to choose from outside of those ranks. In essence, Trump's election stands as a rebuke to the political class. I'm not enthralled with everything that escapes President Trump's lips, yet, I, like the millions who voted for him, became a supporter because of three reasons: his experience, some of his personal characteristics, and his policy positions. President Trump has the experience of a successful businessman with a large part of his success based in the United States. He is not a politician and has never before been elected to political office. Just let that sink in. He has never held elected office before being elected as our president. President Trump's personal characteristics appeal to me. He is patriotic. He is plainspoken. No one would accuse him of being politically correct. He is empathetic to struggling Americans. Going out to Dover Air Force Base today when the body of our fallen Seal came back, shows his empathetic nature, especially to military families. President Trump won't bow to the media. He can bypass the media and speak directly to fellow Americans. This is especially appealing to conservatives like me, who see their views mocked and deliberately mischaracterized by the media. Trump has clear views. He's a family man  with a complicated family, like many of us have. He doesn't pretend to be something he's not. His religious participation mirrors that of many Americans. He appreciates what Larry Alex Taunton calls, The grace effect of the JudeoChristian heritage, even if he only loosely engages in religious participation. Trump is not part of the bicoastal elites. He has thick skin. He does not mind criticism, and he punches back twice as hard. Trump understands how to build a leadership team. He is projectoriented. He's 70 years old. He's not focused on enriching himself. He's not made a lifetime of saying one thing and doing something else. He isn't using the government to enrich himself and his family. He desegregated his club in Florida  he has advanced women in his businesses. He doesn't demean women in the workplace by only seeing them as their gender. Instead, he sees them as what they can accomplish and asks them to reach for excellence as he himself does. Trump is not a committed Republican, and that appeals to us  those of us who are fed up with establishment Republicans who run on conservative principles to beat  to get elected, and then once they come to the swamp of D.C., they abandon all of those principles. Trump is not bound by ideological consistency, right? Instead, he asks, What will work?"

    "data": "Tonight's proposition is one to which it would seem impossible to say no. It appeals to the fair mindedness in all of us. We want to give everyone a chance. And it appeals to the realist in all of us. Donald Trump is the president  the occupant of the Oval Office  as Gayle Trotter said. And we, of course, hope for the best. True. He did arrive in the Oval Office after a career as the primary publicist for the racist lie that Barack Obama was not an American citizen, and true, his business career is built on crookedness, and deception, and fraud. And true, he does have a history of violent abuse with people and he does see women as something more than people who are distinguished for their talents. And true, he was helped into the presidency by the clandestine operations of the Russian secret police. But after all, people do grow in office. So, we want to withhold judgment, if we can, but the core premise of this motion  and this is the premise my partner Michael Waldman and I will call on you to reject. The core premise is that the things that we need to know about Donald Trump lie in the future and not in the past  that we do not yet have sufficient information to form a judgment, but we do. And that is what we will show to you tonight. We know enough to know what to prepare for. And the action of asking you to withhold your judgment is an action that asks you to waste time in uncertainty when it is time to act, to stormproof the Republic and the Constitution against the most dangerous occupant of the office in American history. Donald Trump lies a lot. But, to give him credit, he never lies about himself. He has shown the country who he is and what he is and what he stands for and what he will do. And these are the things  some of the things that we already know. We know that he has already decided to run the least ethical and transparent administration in the modern history of the presidency, and I would say in the history of the presidency period. And those decisions are not in the future, but in the past. He has already decided you will not see his tax returns. He has already decided that he will not put his assets in a blind trust and he will not separate himself from his business interests. He has already decided that people who want access to the Trump family will get it if they pay. He has already decided to charge Mar a Lago visitors or users to double their entry fee to give them a chance for $200,000 instead of $100,000 to have a few minutes with the next president of the United States. He has already  he has already brought  violated his first pledge to separate his sons from his business. They are mingling with senators. They are mingling with senators at the  in ceremony to welcome the new justice of  nominee to the justice of the Supreme Court. So, we know that, it will be unethical. That's a fact. You know that now. The second thing we know is that Donald Trump intends to run an administration that will attack fundamental American liberties. Gayle Trotter said it best. Donald Trump does pose an existential threat to what she called the media, and what I would call the free media. He rejects the very concept of such a thing. The reason he  and not only he but those around him lie so much about everything, about documentable facts, about how many people are in the Washington Mall  many great presidents had less attendance at their inaugurations than Barack Obama. It's no slight to John F. Kennedy that he had a lesser turnout than John  than Barack Obama, that Ronald Reagan did. They went on, each of them, to win places in the hearts of the American people. Turnout isn't everything. The reason he tells these lies  partly it's for his own ego, but partly it is to discredit the very concept of truth. And that is the foundation, as Gerald Ford said, Truth is the fundamental proposition on which democracy rests. We have all  And we have already seen his attempt to create a state media in all but name which his preferential treatment of not only Fox, but Breitbart and Infowars next, which is soon to be accredited in the White House Briefing Room. Most importantly from my point of view, because I do speak as a Republican and as a conservative, we have already seen  it is already a fact that he represents the gravest challenge to the western security system of any occupant of this office. He has already said that he may or may not honor America's commitment to its NATO allies under Article 5. Having said that, you can never unsay that, that knowledge, that something that was certain is now uncertain. The biggest journey in logic, and that is the journey from zero to one, the chance of the United States not honoring its obligation to its friends was zero. Now it's one. Now it exists. Before, it didn't. And that you cannot take away. Nor can you take away  nor can you take away the ever more sickening stink of the mysterious, but doubt  but dangerous connection and possible collusion between this administration and the government of Russia. We don't know what that arrangement is. There's much about it we don't know. But while there are many secrets, there are no mysteries. We understand that something is terribly wrong. And we know this administration will not allow us to get to the bottom of it. But that's the job we have to do. We have to get to the bottom of that. We  the call now is not to ponder or to deliberate or to wait on events. The call now is to say, What are the actions that we as citizens have to take to defend free institutions, to defend the traditions of American government, to defend free media, to send  to reassure America's friends around the world, that the word of the United States government is still good despite the present occupant of the office. That's our job. Don't waste time. And that is why we ask you to reject the motion tonight. Thank you."

    "data": "Well, that's an interesting way to start an Intelligence Squared debate, isn't it, with a call on the audience not to think and not to ponder. I am not a Trump supporter, as Gayle said. And after the past 10 days, I'm even less of a Trump supporter than I was before. I am dismayed by the executive order on immigration. I wrote on Monday that I was both amazed and disturbed by its reckless, blithering incompetence. So, having established my credentials as a Trump critic, how can I be arguing that we should be giving him a chance? I want to suggest several answers, but the main one is simple. We live in a Democracy, and Trump just got elected. Elections, as somebody once said, have consequences. Resolving now, just days in, to nullify his presidency, to stop him by any and all means, to give him no chance regardless of what he does is antidemocratic, plain and simple. It says to his supporters, We hate you guys so much that we'll do all we can to make the election void. It says, in effect, We refuse to accept the result, and that's a very dangerous doctrine. Trump was rightly castigated before the election for saying he might not accept the outcome. The argument applies just as well now with positions reversed. Now, I understand that the election we flawed, that Russian propaganda played a part, that Trump didn't win the popular vote, that he and his campaign lied about this and lied about that. Well, the rules are often unfair to losers, and politicians often lie, elections are always flawed. In a democracy, you take your complaints to the courts and, if you can't prevail there, you accept the transfer of power that follows from a less than perfect real word  real world election. Now, Give him a chance, doesn't mean, Give him carte blanche. It just means, Keep an open mind. Oppose him when he's wrong. I was glad to see those judges push back against his order on refugees. Glad to see some Republicans criticize it sternly. Trump is going to put America's constitutional system under stress. The courts need to step up. Congress needs to step up. Career civil servants deeply opposed to his policies should be getting ready to quit. But we ought to acknowledge the possibility that he might do some good things, even that, in the end, he might be a good president. It's obvious I don't share Gayle's optimism on this, but I hear her arguments, and don't think they deserve to be dismissed out of hand. Trump has made some reassuring cabinet nominations, James Mattis, John Kelly and Rex Tillerson are competent individuals of experience and integrity. Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court is eminently qualified and sufficiently dedicated, it seems to me, to the Constitution and the rule of law, that Trump might actually come to regret the appointment. Trump says he'll bring forward a big increase in infrastructure investment. That would be great. He says he will force drug prices down by negotiating forcefully with the pharmaceutical companies. Again, that's something Democrats long proposed. Maybe he'll succeed in simplifying America's insanely complicated tax system. Maybe those tax plans and his infrastructure plans will even improve America's rate of economic growth. Now, I hesitate to mention trade policy because I think his proposals there are nuts. Abandoning TPP, renegotiating NAFTA and all that. But perhaps a few Democrats in this audience quite like those ideas. Bernie Sanders said he does. If Trump keeps this up, he said, I'll be willing to work with him on some things. Well, come on, if Bernie Sanders is willing to give Trump a chance, shouldn't you be? I want to emphasize one last and very important thing. If you're opposed to Trump, your opposition would be more effective if you give him a chance. What's the best way to contain and, in due course, defeat Trump? Is it to energize the Democratic base to higher and higher levels of outrage, or is it to peel away the support of reluctant Trumpers? I think it's the second. There are plenty of reluctant Trumpers who voted for him out of exhaustion with normal politics, an understandable emotion, in my view. And those people, Independents, moderate Republicans, conservative Democrats weren’t' encouraged to think again by being called bigots and morons. That kind of opposition, which states Trump is a wouldbe dictator and his supporters are either idiots or evil accomplices actually helps Trump. This cannot be overstated. Trump is a brilliant manipulator of reflexive outrage. He provokes it. He thrives on it. An opposition that says give him no chance never collaborate, oppose him regardless, I think he'd like nothing better. So, give him a chance, not least as a gesture of respect to the 40 percent of voters who backed him. Oppose his bad policies casebycase, but let's not assume as David does that the Constitution isn't worth the paper it's written on less than two weeks into this new administration. Give him a chance not to ease his path going forward, but to do just the opposite, to give his supporters space to have second thoughts. In a democracy, that's how you win the argument."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you everybody. You know, Clive and Gayle both have eloquently asked us to suspend judgment, to suspend what we see with our own eyes, what we hear with our own ears, to turn our minds away from what we see unfolding in front of us. My colleague, David Frum, and I suggest that that is not the wise course for the country. Now I'll admit that whe the topic was chosen before the inauguration, should we give him a chance, I was happy to be invited to participate in this, but a little nervous about the topic, because what could be more sensible than giving someone a chance? It sounds so wholesome and American. And I care about the presidency. I care about our system working. I've lived through changes in administration and some of them I like and some of them I don't like, but I believe this is different. This is not a normal presidency and this is no ordinary time. As you know, David Frum and I come to this through different paths. He is a proud conservative. I am a proud progressive. But we both believe, and I think millions of Americans passionately believe that we need to stand up to the potential abuse, to the potential threats to the Constitution, to the potential extremism of this administration and this president of a kind that we have not seen in this country in years if ever. The fabric of our democracy is stretched thin in some very basic ways. So, give him a chance. I mean, in a sense I would say we've already given him a chance. So, put aside, put aside the ugly divisive campaign. Please, put it aside. Put aside the fact, as David said, that a hostile foreign power intervened in our election to help elect Donald Trump. Put aside the fact that he entered office the least popular president since the invention of polls having, among other things, lost the popular vote. Put all that aside. Let's only look at what he's actually done since being sworn in. It seems like a million or two years ago; it was 10 days ago. I know I'm not the only one who wonders how any of us are going to be able to keep this up over four years. Put all that aside. Did he scramble the decks? Did he reach out? Did he come up with some new ideological firmament that would reach out to the Democrats? We all know what's happened. No president in a century has installed an administration this extreme. A chief strategist who previously ran a white nationalist website, a national security advisor who peddles conspiracy theories and who said Islam is a cancer, an attorney general nominee so far on the fringe that the Senate controlled by the Republican party rejected Jeff Sessions for judgeship because of racial insensitivity. No president in this century or last has posed this kind of threat to civil rights and civil liberties. Just days in, the president of the United States, who swore to uphold the Constitution, started peddling the nonsensical argument that there were three million illegal votes in this country. This is not some random guy on the internet. This is the President of the United States. And think about how absurd that is. Three million votes, not 50 years ago, not 25 years ago  two months ago  and nobody noticed. Not the Republican Party, not Fox News. Nobody noticed. But the president is insisting he's launching an investigation which will likely be a witch hunt, and he's promising legislation to come out of it. And what could go wrong with that? And no president in the beginning of his administration has provoked a constitutional crisis one week in. We all know, because we've been living through it, that the President hastily drafted an executive order banning travel from seven Muslimmajority countries  has provoked a crisis in so many different ways. The order was a travesty. It was basically a Tweet turned into an executive order. Four federal judges blocked it one week in. He had to fire the acting Attorney General of the United States, who properly and correctly pointed out that the law was illegal, one week in. That's the spirit we need. In the last day  Again, folks, this is not a matter of projecting in the future. This has happened in front of our appalled eyes all within the last 10 days. There are so many things to be concerned about. It is the case that Clive has written eloquently about what a fiasco the president has made of his first 10 days in office. I will do him  I don't need to quote it. I will only say that given the things you've said, I want to tell you that we welcome refugees. We're happy to have you come over to our side.  in the last day, the President has backed off on his pledge to do something about drug prices. He's backed off on many of his things. And if you really believe there's going to be a genuine infrastructure bill worked out with the Democrats, I have some infrastructure to sell you in Brooklyn, because I don't think it's going to happen. For all those reasons and there are many in which of course I think the potential consequences of policies are wrong  we say and we ask you to say stand up, take advantage of our role in  as a democracy  as citizens. Say no to abuse and do not give President Trump an untrammeled chance to trash our institutions, or the constitutions, or the law. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. I really want to start out really quickly by offering my condolences and recognizing the severe loss that we had in the law enforcement community, the death of the legend, the hero, NYPD detective Steven Mac Donald. All right. No clapping. Don't take away my time now. And I wanted to start off by doing that and acknowledge his loss  tremendous loss to this city. I want to start off because we were talking about bias here. It's clear  I think we have to get a better understanding about what it is specifically. What is bias? And I know we're talking about policing and racially biased, so, I took it upon myself to bring out some definitions for us to go over. So, if you don't mind, I'd like to start off by reading MerriamWebster's definition of bias. Included in that definition is a bent, tendency, an inclination, or temperament, or outlook  especially a personal and sometimes unreasoned judgment. That's bias. I also refer to the Black Law Dictionary. The Black's Law Dictionary has bias listed as inclination, a bent, a prepossession, a preconceived notion or predisposition to decide a cause or an issue in a certain way. Most importantly, I want this last line in Black's definition is, This term is not synonymous with prejudice. I want us to remember that as we vote on this motion. And you should be voting yes on the motion. But remember, this term is not synonymous with prejudice. I suspect that through the course of this evening what you're going to hear is a boatload of statistics, a truckload of data that will attempt to explain what many of us already know. What many of us are already acknowledged and what many of us are working hard to prevent or at least address. And I think we just have to be honest about certain things. When you're talking about police bias, let's just be honest about it because these numbers, this data that I suspect that you'll be hearing this evening, actual bias is not easily quantified. It's hard to really put numbers to specific and detailed bias. Without a historical context, without legal context, it becomes confusing. And that's why I'm honored tonight that Gloria, my debate partner, will be dealing and addressing with some of those historical and legal, contextual issues, because you can't just go nakedly into this conversation and expect to fully grasp and understand it. And if you deny bias and you reject not only your common sense but the experiences of many people like myself, a rejection of bias in policing is intellectually dishonest. And that's why you must vote yes to the question. You  if you don't vote yes to the question, what you do is reject the story that I have, the experience that I have  20 years in the police department in every unit in the police department; plain clothes, narcotics division, uniform patrol, observing what I observed. Or, perhaps, my personal experiences, being  just shortly before going into the police academy, being stopped on Springfield Boulevard into a checkpoint along with five other vehicles. There's five other black men, and we were all tossed out of our cars, many of us physically. I was thrown across the trunk of my car onto the street. It was later explained to me that I was stopped because they were looking for a black man in a dark car. That was one week before the academy. Or, maybe perhaps, the experience that my own son had 23 years later, less than a mile from the same location than it occurred with me. Or, maybe, less innocuous is this, if you remember. This is going to give you an example of bias. In 2003, there was, in the Prospect Park, the Philharmonic was playing. 2003, let me remind you, was a time when there was a severe and heavy crackdown  zero tolerance in the communities of color across this  across the city. No tolerance for drinking in public, no tolerance for loitering, no tolerance for this. Absolutely zero tolerance, yet, still Mayor Bloomberg  then Mayor Bloomberg sat in Prospect Park drinking his wine, laying out on a blanket, being offered all types of alcohol. He said, Well, these people are different. There's not a problem with this. So, the police enforcement isn't necessary. The police did nothing to those large crowds of wine and cheese drinkers in Prospect Park, so much to the point where I went the next week to Bryant Park with my little blanket and my wine and my cheese, and I drank very well. Bias, no enforcement. Finally, I want to say  and I wanted to go into a stop and frisk data and information. I don't think I'll have an opportunity to. But I wanted to tell you that the other victims of bias policing are those hardworking, diligent, dedicated law enforcement professionals who because of biased policing are put in positions and given quotas and false productivity standards which place them in harm's way because they have increased contact and increased liability. It is not the everyday police officer who sets the tone and determines the level of bias in policing right now. It is the system, which I'm sure Professor Marshall will be going into historical context again  it is the system that places not only a certain population of citizens, but our police officers, in increased harm's way. Vote yes for the truth. Vote yes on the motion."

    "data": "I want to start off by saying that this is an incredibly awkward experience talking about race like this. I kind of wish we had been given a bland and uncontroversial topic like religion or presidential politics. And this problem is compounded by the overt racism of the organizer of this event by pitting two black people against two white people. Now, Heather Mac Donald, she is extremely white. And the other thing that I thought I'd share with you, a vignette from my time as a police officer, I was sent to a park to deal with a drunk. And while I was speaking to him, I can tell he was reading my name tag. He was staggering a little bit. His lips were moving, and he finally looked over to me and said, Stern, are you Jewish or white? And I was taken aback. I didn't have an answer for him that was very good, so I arrested him. Just  just kidding, Professor. But this highlights one of the truths about race and police work, and that's that it's complicated. It's fraught with confusion and misconceptions. Heather and I are going to explain to you  all right, in large part it's going to be data driven because when we try to extrapolate our own personal experiences, we often get lost in stories and anecdotes that seem wildly important and emotional to us but don't necessarily form the basis for promulgating policy. So, Heather is going to focus on the data that proves conclusively that policing in America is not biased. She's also going to talk about how the cry for safety in the black community really drives the police response. But let me tell you something. In one, our argument can be summarized as follows by an uncomfortable but inescapable truth, and here it is, black people commit more crime per capita than other groups. It's not something that I say cheerfully, but it's true. And the real problem with that statement is not only that it makes me personally uncomfortable and it's hard to say, but that people hear it as, He's saying, black people are bad, or that black people are criminals. And the natural response to that is a reflexive reaction which puts it back on the police. It turns it around in a sense and says, That can't be the case. In fact, it has to be the police that are racist, the police that are bad, and we need to find a solution to that. I liken this to the preAristotelian scientists who had the theory of what they called spontaneous generation. And that was the idea that you could create mice out of thin air by putting down some old clothes and straw and they magically appeared. And the corollary is that the people who are proponents of this proposition feel that crime is created by the internal racism and bad thoughts of the police. This isn't the case. The  what I can tell you, which is indisputable, is that this discussion is driven in large part by the highprofile incidents that we've seen that are infamous and are often captured on video. I'm going to paraphrase Meryl Streep, all right, in this regard, and say to you, that only reprobates enjoy seeing violence like police action on TV, NFL games, and what was it, MMA fights? And my partner and mentor, the great trial lawyer, Mike Rains, puts it another way. And he says, Force  police use of force always looks ugly on videotapes. And this is a truth because none of us like to see violence in any form other than those reprobates that Meryl Streep and I like to talk about. But that's an incredibly poor vehicle for forming public policy because these are the extreme cases. In my remaining time, I'm going to suggest to you, inferentially, there's proof that the proposition of policing is racist in America can be shown by the wrongheaded, misguided consequences that are a result of that kind of thinking. First and foremost, is the inevitable increase in crime because when policy makers are almost myopically focused on stop data saying that it's disproportional and that it's not correlated to incidents of crime, the message to the police is, stop doing police work. The nature, maybe the essence of police work, is suspicion. It's Inspector Porfiry figuring out by subtle observation that Kalmykov was the suspect in the murders. It's the state trooper who pulled over Timothy McVeigh for a license tab violation. It's the Italian police who stopped the Berlin Christmas terrorists for an ID check and wound up figuring out who he was."

    "data": "Policing is racially biased. We're not saying that every police officer operates with racial animus. We're saying, generally, policing is racially biased and we support the motion with law, history, and practice. With law. Well, this city  New York City, was sued by Mr. Floyd, and in 2013 the federal court said policing in New York City is racially biased, as well as the Justice Department of the United States said there were small, as well as large, police departments across the country and are finding that policing is racially biased. The United Nations said in 2013 in its report by the Human Rights Commission, policing is racially biased. By that point alone, we have won. However, we also need to know this, that the police department made up of people who've joined the police to help others are part of an extension of an American society that has race as that original sin. I'm going to go through 400 years of history in a minute and a half. Four hundred years of history, a minute and a half. 1607, Jamestown colony is founded in Virginia. 1619, 20 Africans arrive in that colony. 1620, the Mayflower lands. We were here before the Mayflower. In the 1600s, you had hardworking people of African descent following the law, but then the laws changed, didn't they? And subjected them to chain slavery. Subjected to chain slavery and freedom becomes a crime, but then slavery is the law. Who enforces slavery? Militias, small groups, slave catchers. In our society, it's not the bobbies of London that start the police force. It is the slave patrols from which our police force then is founded. Those slave patrols, the bounty hunters whose job it is to go find those runaway slaves and bring them back. 1865, the 13th Amendment abolishes slavery, but read your Constitution. Slavery is abolished except as punishment for a crime. The words are there. Slavery is abolished except as punishment for a crime. So, what happens between 1865 and World War II? The convict lease system. Criminal laws are put in place to criminalize black behavior so that they can then be used as laborers, remember the movie The Shawshank Redemption? The wardens then lease out the prison laborers. But then how do you get that labor? You create criminal laws that criminalize black behavior. You round them up. You do these things, and then you work them  some of them worked to death. Remember, from 1865 to World War II. Then we have Jim Crow segregation. Who then enforces segregation? The criminal justice system, police officers. Over 4,000 people were lynched in this country, burned alive, castrated, throats cut, tortured. This happened right here in the United States. Was anybody arrested? No. Where were the police officers for African Americans? No people were arrested. And yet, we fight on, believing in our criminal justice system, even though the police officers are protecting those people. There are pictures of those crowds standing there with bodies hanging from trees. Where are the police? Then we get the Civil Rights movement, and there's movement forward. But then, in 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court rules, in Terry v. Ohio, that the police have unprecedented authority to stop and frisk based on reasonable suspicion of imminent danger. But now, as we go through time, we find the imminent danger part has dropped away. Police officers are stopping people, but they're stopping mostly brown and black people, until by 2011, we have 600,000 people stopped by police  nearly 700,000 people  the majority of whom are black and brown. That's why the Floyd case in 2013 ruled that there was racial profiling practiced in this city. History, practice, law. You will hear that the police officers have no choice but to go to into certain communities based on data. But can't it be both data as well as racial bias? We say that there is both. You can have some data, but there's also racial bias. He said that black people commit more crimes. What kind of crimes? How many of you were smoking marijuana, or your friends? That's a crime. How many of you were committing criminal acts, and you know the police wouldn't stop you for it? What kind of crimes? When they talk about African Americans, they want to talk about violent crimes. And then they want to vilify those people who protest against our public servants we pay taxes for, who are abusing our rights. This country was born in protest. The Declaration of Independence was protest. We should not be vilifying those people, those citizens who say, We want the police to help us, not hurt us. Will someone Christian decide when the antiSemitism is over? Will a man when decide when there's no more sexism? I don't think so. There is racial bias  in policing. Vote yes for the motion. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you very much. Let me state some core principles. The police have an absolute obligation to treat everyone they encounter with courtesy and respect. Too often, cops develop hardened, obnoxious attitudes towards the public. Second, every police shooting of an innocent civilian is a stomachchurning tragedy. Tactical training has to work incessantly to prevent such calamities. Third, given this country's appalling history of racism, and the use of police brutality to uphold slavery and segregation, police shootings of black men are particularly and understandably fraught. But however tragic the history of policing and race, patterns of policing today do not demonstrate police bias. Contemporary policing is data driven. In order to save lives, cops go where people are most being victimized, and that is in minority neighborhoods. To understand policing, you first have to look at the facts of crime, however uncomfortable it may be to do so. I'm going to focus on fatal police shootings, because that has been the focus as well of the Black Lives Matter movement. In 2015, cops killed 991 people  the vast majority, armed and dangerous. 50 percent of the victims of police shootings were white, though you would never know it from the press coverage. Among the white victims of fatal police shootings was a 50yearold in Tuscaloosa, Alabama in a domestic violence incident, who ran at the officer with a spoon, and a 28yearold driver in Des Moines, Iowa, who led the police on a car chase and then walked quickly towards the shooting officer. Now, had any of those victims been white, there's a good chance they would have become a national news story  been black, excuse me. But because they were white and didn't fit the national narrative about policing and race, they are completely unknown. Now, 26 percent of the victims of fatal police shootings in 2015 were black. Does that indicate police racism? After all, blacks are only 13 percent of the nation's population. It does not. Police shootings are going to occur where the police most frequently encounter violence and resisting suspects, and that is in also minority neighborhoods. Police activity, whether stops, arrests, or shootings, should be measured against crime, not population ratios. According to the Justice Department, blacks die of homicide at six times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined. That's because blacks commit homicide at eight times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined according to the Justice Department. In the 75 largest counties of the United States, which is where most of the population resides, blacks commit over 50 percent of all violent crime, though they're 15 percent of the population in those counties. These crime disparities are repeated in every big American city. Here in New York, blacks commit 75 percent of all shootings, though they're 23 percent of the population. How do we know that? That's what the victims of and witnesses to those shootings, who are overwhelmingly minority themselves, tell the police. Whites commit 2 percent of all shootings, though they are 34 percent of the city's population. Add Hispanic shootings to black shootings, and you account for 98 percent of all shootings in New York City. This means that virtually every time the cops are called out to a shooting scene, they're being called to a minority neighborhood on behalf of minority victims and being given a description of a minority suspect. The cops don't wish that disparity. It's a reality forced upon them by the reality of crime. The other factor that drives police activity is community requests for assistant. Go to any police community meeting in a highcrime area, and you'll hear some version of the following questions, you arrest the drug dealers and they're back on the corner the next day; there's teens hanging out in the street fighting; what ever happened to truancy and loitering laws; there's trespassers in my lobby smoking weed and selling drugs. I'm scared to go down to get my mail. The irony is this, if the police respond to these heartfelt questions for public order they'll generate the racially disproportionate enforcement activity that can be used against them however falsely in a racial profiling lawsuit. But if they don't respond, they'll be ignoring the thousands of hardworking, lawabiding inner city residents who beg the police for public order. In conclusion, policing today is not racially biased. In fact, there is no government agency that is more dedicated to the proposition that black lives matter than the police. Thanks to datadriven proactive policing, thousands of minority lives were saved over the last two decades that would have been lost had crime rates remained at their early 1990s levels. The police must work incessantly to improve their communications and tactical skills. And if an officer abuses his authority, he must be removed. But as long as crime and victimization remain so unevenly distributed throughout the population, police civilian contacts will be too. That is not racism, it is reality. Thank you."

    "data": "Good evening. Thank you. Thank you for being here tonight to discuss what I think is the most important subject facing America today. We have a lot of debates in this country today about what should we do. This policy versus that policy, this much tax versus that much tax, this much regulation versus that much regulation. But I believe that those debates primarily miss the point of what's going on in America today. There is indeed a single fundamental question facing us as Americans today, and it is not what should we do. The question facing us and facing our fellow countrymen is a twoword question, very simply, who decides. The American founders had a simple answer for that question and it is found in three words that you see up behind the stage and those words are, We the People, decide. In the intervening century since that original constitutional convention the powers that be have shifted in America. Where they used to reside in the people at the state level closest to their governments at home, today the vast majority of power resides in Washington, D.C. I think it's important that we take a little trip across history to 1787 to that convention to what I think is perhaps the most important day in American history. September 15th is a day that I will never forget, because September 15th is my wife's birthday, so it's important I not forget that. But it is also Article V Day. I take you back to the convention hall on that steamy September day in 1787 when Colonel George Mason from Virginia arose and addressed the assembly. And he said something like this, My fellow commissioners, I fear we have made a terrible mistake. It is two days before the end of the convention and we have drafted a document that contains a fatal flaw in that it gives Congress the power to propose amendments should they deem them necessary, but it does not give the same power to the people acting through the states. And he asked them this very important question  which I ask you today, Are we so naïve that we believe that a federal government that becomes a tyranny will propose the appropriate source of amendments to restrain its own tyranny? I wish we had a camera in that room, because I imagine all the guys in there slapping their foreheads and laughing. No government has ever restrained its own tyranny in the entire history of human kind, and if you believe that the federal government has drawn too much power to Washington, D.C., if you believe  as Larry said, that it is time to drain the swamp, then the Founders  thanks to Colonel George Mason, gave us a remedy and that remedy is found by calling a convention of states under Article V and draining the swamp. The great plug that we may pull is not an election. We've tried elections. Democrats have tried elections. Many of my friends on the left felt that the election of President Obama was a sea change in America, and that everything would change in Washington, D.C., and the culture would become less corrupt and the people would be in charge. And for many of my friends on the left, they would tell you that things remained largely the same, better than with Republicans in control, but no fundamental change from Washington, D.C. And we've seen over the last few series of elections a sweep by Republicans of historic proportions and many people on the right thought we were going to see a sea change in governance in Washington, D.C. because of the results of these elections. And I can tell you the feeling on the right today, even with the presidential election that just took place is that we haven't seen very much change and, frankly, we don't expect to see very much change. So the question is, if we have tried over and over, election cycle after election cycle, decade after decade, if we have tried the same thing  which is to elect good people who we believe represent our interests  and let me make clear, we have an obligation to do that and we have tried to elect good people and in some instances we really have elected some good people to Washington, D.C., and yet the swamp remains in Washington, D.C. Then I ask, do we continue to do the exact same thing, argue about policy, argue about the should's and the shouldn't's, elect good people, and expect different results? Somebody much smarter than me said that age old adage, To do the same thing and expect a different result is,  well, you know what I'm saying. And so here we find ourselves on the precipice of national disaster. If you didn't like the results of the election, you think that was a disaster. If you don't like what's going on in Washington, D.C., you think we have an ongoing disaster. The majority of your fellow Americans believe that, by the way, for different reasons. Seventy two percent of Americans today say that the federal government is too big and does too much, and I want to make clear, on the right, they have different reasons for saying that. They might think the welfare state is too big or Washington, D.C. controls too much of the country and on the left, they might be talking about the military industrial complex, all the crony capitalism  actually crony capitalism on both sides today, right? We've seen it recently in the news. So, this is where we find ourselves in America. You and you and you and I, regardless of our political affiliations, regardless of our ideologies, find ourselves at home watching TV incredulously saying that's not what I voted for. Democrat or Republican, that's not what I voted for. Liberal, conservative, Libertarian, that's not what we voted for. So, I come before you today to propose this, to tell you that we are too smart as a people. We have too strong a heritage as a selfgoverning nation to allow this situation to continue. And so today, what I ask you for, is I ask you for your vote. I ask you to stand in the shoes of our forefathers, to be brave, to act boldly, and to call an Article V convention to amend the Constitution. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you, John. Could the U.S. Constitution be improved? Of course, it could. And I agree with some of the ideas that we will be hearing tonight for ways of improving it. You will probably agree with some of them, too, not necessarily the same ideas that I agree with. But flirting around with the balanced budget proposals, the proposals to return power to the states, yes, I agree with some of those ideas. And when I talk about an Article V convention as dangerous and uncharted, I therefore am not talking about the fact that I would necessarily dislike the actual amendments proposed, nor am I saying that I would necessarily find that bad people, worse than our current elected representatives, would get into the positions of being the delegates to such a convention. Now, when my partner, David, comes on the stage, he will talk a little about those issues; what if it goes toward issues that you might not agree with? What if the people who get into the convention as delegates are people who are not there for the right reasons or are there for some of the same wrong reasons as people get into other elected officials? But I'm going to leave that. I say dangerous and uncharted for a couple of reasons. And let me start with, uncharted. This process has not been used in 225 years, and I think there is a good reason why it is not, even though it's clearly spelled out in the Constitution. We have only used the other way of amending the Constitution, which is for Congress to propose. We have never used the method by which the states call a convention. And because it has never been used, courts have not generated any precedent. We don't know how this would work. We do know that the relevant language in Article V is very terse and very uninformative. It does not answer most of the questions we would like to ask. For example, one of the first questions about a convention would be, Does each state have the same vote, so that New York has the same vote as North Dakota and California has the same vote as Alaska. Many of my conservative friends who are proposing a convention say, yes, obviously, it does. You turn to the literature written by a lot of our more liberal friends, and they certainly are not endorsing that. They would think that would be terribly unfair to the people of New York and California. And yet, you look at the text of the Constitution, and it does not decide, nor does it decide such key questions as: when does Congress have to call a convention? We know that there are numbers in there. We know that if 34 states currently call for one, then Congress must call it. That's twothirds of the states. But how do you get to the 34? There are more than 34 calls already on Congress' desk. I know Congress has no desk, but bear with me. These include a large stock of balanced budget amendments which, however, have different wording. Six or eight, I believe it is by now, proposals from Professor Lessig's side, on campaign finance, and a bunch of old ones hanging around on issues like reapportionment and I think even prohibition, because according to some people at least, once a petition goes into Congress, unless a state rescinds it, it never goes away. So, Congress has some discretion here. It can either decide to lump together petitions by states that are not actually worded the same way  let's say on a balanced budget, or it could, if it wanted to be radical, lump together ones that are on totally different subjects. And there are people urging that too. So, if a convention is called to deal with a single issue, is it legally bound not to stray off and treat related issues or perhaps completely unrelated issues? The language does not say. So, what we are setting ourselves up for here is uncertainty, which will be resolved by two different institutions: the Congress and the Supreme Court. And ironically, these are exactly the same two institutions that this whole process is intended to work around. So, the groups that will decide whether you can effectively use this or whether they will sabotage it are the same groups you're trying to defeat, Congress and the Supreme Court. And it's bad enough for Congress to get to make the decisions. The Supreme Court, I love the Supreme Court. It's so wonderful. And yet  and yet it decides things at the very end, after we have enacted, let's say four Constitutional amendments and ratified them through 38 states. And then we find out that the T's were not crossed or the I's were not dotted, or we missed one of those calls that I said about how a convention had to be done, and the Supreme Court strikes the whole thing down. What this leads us toward is a crisis Constitutional legitimacy, you'll hear a little more about that from my colleague, David. But we have had too many of those already. We do not need a situation in which we are uncertain whether or not Constitutional amendments have been adopted in legitimate form. And that is why I say we are standing here with a temptation. It is a temptation that at first glance could solve lots of our problems. It is also a temptation that could lead us even deeper into the land of polarization. Into the land of considering our own government illegitimate, into the land of special interest involvement. It is a dangerous, uncharted territory. And we are a divided nation in so many ways. I think it's one of the reasons why it would be a waste of effort because there would never be, in fact, 38 ratifications of these amendments. You can't actually come up with something that would with strand the scrutiny of that many state legislatures. So, we would have placed our hopes in this basket, all to lose them in the end. Thank you."

    "data": "So, I come to this issue for reasons very different from my friend, Mark Meckler. But we come to the same place in concluding we need this procedure to address the different problems that motivate us to be activists in this field. I am obsessed with the question whether we can have a representative government in America again. I am obsessed with the fact that at the core of our government is a failed institution called Congress, an institution which in no sense represents us. It doesn't represent us because the politicians gerrymander districts so the system is not representative. It doesn't represent us because the politicians suppress the votes of the people on the other side, and it doesn't represent us because the politicians obsessively spend their time raising money from the tiniest fraction of the one percent to fund their campaigns to get back into Washington. It doesn't represent us. And because it doesn't represent us, the problems that Americans care about are problems our Congress cannot sensibly address. And the problems that I care about most, problems of equality, problems of climate change, are problems which our Congress will never address sensibly so long as it does not represent us. Now, the critical point to recognize about that failure of representation is that they won't fix it. They do not have the incentive to fix it because the problems make it easy for them to stay in power. They don't know. They haven't the horizon. They haven't the motivation to address these problems in a way that allows us to believe they can be fixed. So, if you think there are problems our Congress cannot itself fix, the question is, what do we do? How do we fix them? Now, the framers faced that problem. And they looked at a Constitution, the Articles of Confederation, that required unanimous consent to be amended. And after recognizing unanimous consent was not possible, they threw up their hands and walked away from it, and they proposed a convention  a Constitutional convention that drafted a new Constitution, and they ratified that new Constitution against the procedures of the old Constitution. We on this stage  Mark and I  do not want a constitutional convention, because our constitution gives us a much simpler way to go around Congress. This is Mason's gift to America. It gives us a way to convene a body that's not controlled by Congress for the single purpose of proposing amendments. Of proposing amendments which are not part of our constitution unless 38 states ratify it. Now, 38 is a popular number these days. It's also the number of electors that need to change in the Electoral College, but the one I want to focus you on is  this is my playful jab to my friend here. The one I want to focus you on here is how easy it is to block an amendment because the number is 38 states. Because 38 states  that means that one house in 13 states would need to vote against the amendment to make sure it can't pass. And in 2017, there will be 13 Democraticcontrolled legislatures, and five split legislatures, and 38 Republican legislatures with the five split legislatures. And so, when you think in the Democratic side, you can say, That means there are 31 opportunities for a house to block the proposed constitutional amendment, and there are many more on the other side. And what that means is not that nothing gets passed, but that the only thing that can get passed through this procedure is something that actually speaks to all of us. And the only thing Mark and I are asking you to support tonight is the opportunity for people to sit down and try to work out reforms of our Constitution that actually speak to all of us. And if we fail, we fail. But if we succeed, then we will have succeeded in solving what I think of as the crucial problem of American democracy, that it does not represent us anymore. And we have to find a way to make it represent us again. I ask you to support our proposal."

    "data": "It's hard to imagine a worst time to amend the Constitution than now. We are a nation  of anger. We've just elected a president  and letters to the editor, polls, and so on say that people wanted to tear things down, wanted to shake things up  but they had confidence there would be checks and balances to keep the new president from doing too much. A constitutional convention throws away those checks and balances. This is a time of division. Four of the last five presidential elections have left huge segments of the population questioning not just the desirability of the result, but even its legitimacy. We can't even agree on who has any business being president. Imagine if we push through constitutional amendments through this process, and the country now believes we don't even have a legitimate Constitution. This is a time of special interests. I'm captivated  as I'm sure you all are  by Professor Lessig's vision of the people coming together to work things out, but that's not who it's going to be. It's going to be the same special interests that control Congress will control who are these delegates. Among the points my partner notes are open for the Congress to sort out is who picks the delegates. Will it be the state legislatures, which were elected in precisely the system that Professor Lessig criticizes? Will it  or will it be a vote of the public? Probably the legislatures will keep it to themselves and the very Congress that he criticizes  with much  justification will be the ones that decide what the ground rules are. This is a time of division. On occasions in the past, when we've amended the Constitution, it was because we as a country agreed on something. We were all together on something. Right now, we're together on very little, sadly. This is the time  this is very much the time when we should be organizing, persuading, talking with one another trying to reach across the divides that we have, not using the power tactics of a constitutional convention to try to paper over the consensus that we simply lack. We don't need a situation in which large parts of the country believe that their Constitution's lost legitimacy. Under the proposed rules for constitutional convention put out via the American Legislative Exchange Council  ALEC, which has been very influential in driving the effort to move to a constitutional convention, every state would have an equal vote. That would mean  and that the convention could propose amendments by a majority of the states. That would mean that delegates from states with just 13 percent of the American population could put constitutional amendments out there. How could this go wrong? Quite a few different ways. Certainly, there's the question of who will become the delegates. In all likelihood, state legislators will choose themselves and we will get the  junior versions of the same problem that we have in Congress, people that are dominated by special interests. It seems to me bizarre that at a time when we're worried quite rightly about big money and special interests dominating politics, that we would up the ante. The very time when our system is most broken we would raise the stakes and put not just public policy and who's in government for the next number of years, but the very fabric of our country on the line. That does not seem to be a good thing to do in our current special interest dominated period. In addition, the ratification process is held up as some sort of a protection, but as Professor Lessig just noted, the original constitutional convention scrapped the ratification procedures that it inherited, which required a unanimous agreement and came up with two new rules. A rule for it, twothirds approval, and a rule for other amendments later, threequarters approval. One can easily imagine a new convention doing something very much the same requiring majority ratification of its new Constitution and perhaps reverting to the three quarters approach for later ones. If that happens, what are the states that don't ratify? That don't like the new regime. They can effectively secede or they can go along with the regime of the new Constitution that has been pushed out by this convention. And also, with regards to ratification, the assumption is that these will be simple amendments  single amendments. Seven of the 27 amendments we've had up to this point have had multiple purposes to them. So, you can imagine logrolling on the constitutional amendments just as you do with legislation. What would happen if we had a proposal for a balanced budget amendment and gun control? What would happen if we had a proposal to repeal the takings clause that allows the government to take private property and get rid of the Electoral College? I don't know, and no serious person can say that they know. And then what about sleeper amendments? We're told that we should be counting calls for conventions that were passed back in the '70s. What if we put some amendments out there that don't immediately get ratified, but at some point when there's a wave election to the left or to the right, the additional legislatures come on board, states change, demographics change. We never have a point when the country as a whole is united behind something and yet we  and yet over time we can accumulate enough legislatures to do it. The biggest problem with all of this is that there's absolutely no one to watch the hen house and it's going to be infested with foxes. Thank you."

    "data": "The resolution we have all agreed to debate tonight asks you to consider whether President Obama's foreign policy failed. Failure in our view means one of two things. First, did President Obama fail to achieve the objectives he set out for himself? For example, did he fail to end the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, a goal that featured heavily in virtually every major foreign policy address. Did he fail to take effective action to stop mass atrocities, which he called, A core national security interest? Alternatively, did President Obama fail according to the standard of any reasonable person? For example, no president intends to undermine the credibility of the United States. At the end of President Obama's tenure, do our words mean more or less? Every president intends to secure lasting and sustainable foreign policy achievements. Will President Obama's major initiatives stand the test of time? It's important to keep in mind that failure does not equate to blame. You can conclude that President Obama's foreign policy failed even if you believe that he was wellintentioned, which of course he was. You can conclude that President Obama failed, even if you ultimately blame the failure on the Republican Congress, on unpredictable political events, even the winds of fate. Eliot and I will outline a number of critical administration failures. But before we begin, two final words about the motion. First, this is a debate about President Obama's policy. This is not a debate about his predecessors. And it's possible to conclude that President Obama failed, even if you believe that some of his predecessors' policies were worse. Indeed, even if you believe that his successor's policies will be worse. Second, this is a debate about foreign policy. It is not a debate about the broader legacy of the Obama administration, and it is possible to conclude that President Obama's foreign policy failed even if you approve of his presidency overall. As you heard earlier, Derek recently published a book on the precise topic under discussion tonight: the Obama foreign policy legacy. And although the book is a thoughtful defense of the administration, and I recommend it to all of you  and although Derek is our friend  Eliot and I are prepared to use the book against him. We may even enjoy it. So, with apologies to Derek, I'd like to begin with what I suspect were the hardest chapters to write: the defense of the administration's record in Syria, which Derek acknowledges has become a regional inferno. Close to half a million people have been killed and 13 million Syrians have left their homes. Children as young as 4 have arrived at the Syrian border alone. Syria is not only the worst humanitarian crisis since World War 2, it's a strategic disaster. Historic refugee flows have destabilized the region. Derek describes it as a disintegration of a regional order that the world will be grappling with for at least a generation. Refugee flows have plunged Europe into political crisis. Jihadies holding passports from 100 different countries have joined the caliphate, which now stretches over 40,000 square miles. This will have profound longterm implications for the spread of terrorism globally. Iran has expanded its influence throughout the region and Russia now holds a position of prominence in the Middle East it hasn't enjoyed since the 1970s. American credibility suffered immense damage since President Obama failed to enforce his own redline against Bashar Assad's use of chemical weapons in 2013, in 2014, in 2015, and again this year. Assad remains in power notwithstanding numerous statements from the president since 2011 that he must go. And we've demonstrated our willingness to tolerate any degree of brutality against the Syrian people. I don't expect you'll hear Derek and Vikram argue that Syria is a success. Indeed, it's remarkable how many former Obama administration officials have criticized the administration’s Syria policies. Fred Huff and Ambassador Ford, Secretary Panetta, General Allen, not to mention  to say nothing of the strong written protests from 51 current foreign service officers. From an administration that called the prevention of mass atrocities a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility, Syria is a colossal failure with consequences that weigh with us for generations to come. One addition failure to keep in mind, President Obama ran on, and reiterated numerous times, his desire to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons. He called the Nonproliferation Treaty, which sets international rules for the use of nuclear technology, a centerpiece of his foreign policy. Rather than strengthen the treaty and encourage countries to comply with its terms, the administration rewarded its principle violator, increasing the risk that other countries will follow suit. Under the terms of the deal the administration negotiated, Iran is allowed to keep a substantial nuclear enrichment program, is allowed to continue building out its missile program in violation of numerous security council resolutions, and was provided close to $2 billion in cash from the U.S. Treasury. Bizarrely, Iran is allowed to do selfinspection at a key site. Nothing in the deal restrains Iran's violent activities in Syria and Iraq. Most egregiously, key terms of the deal expire in 10 and 15 years, at which point Iran could have a breakout time of weeks or even days. As a nuclear arms control deal, it's inexplicable. We urge you to vote for the motion."

    "data": "I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight and I want to say it's an honor to share the stage with Eliot and Kristen. They're two people I admire. I consider them friends. We're all members of the Washington Swamp, so I look forward  to the conversation tonight. And how should we judge whether a president's foreign policy is a success or a failure? Obama has compared being president to being a relay racer, in which you get elected and you inherit a situation that you can do nothing about, and all you can do as president is make the best with the time that you've got, make as much progress as you can, set your successor up for success, and then you execute a clean handoff with the next president taking the baton for his leg of the race. So, foreign policy success should be measured in a simple way. Did the president improve on what he inherited? Did he do as much as possible to set the next president up for success, positioning the U.S. to win the long game? For Barack Obama's foreign policy, we believe without any doubt the answer is yes. Obama has restored America's strength and repositioned America to lead in the world. To make our case against this resolution, I will talk about what Obama inherited and what he said he would do about it. Vikram will talk about what Obama has achieved. Now, think back to eight years ago, if you were sitting on November 29, 2008. By almost every measure at home and abroad, the United States was a declining power. Now, America can't be strong in the world unless it's strong at home and what Obama inherited eight years ago, was pretty grim. Eight hundred thousand Americans were losing their jobs every month. Millions of Americans were thrown out of their homes. The U.S. economy was on the verge of complete collapse with major financial institutions that had already gone under, and the U.S. auto industry was about ready to go belly up. It didn't get much better when we looked abroad with nearly 200,000 American troops in harm's way in the Middle East and Afghanistan, nearly breaking the back of the military, with many of these forces on their third or fourth deployments, and thousands of Americans grievously wounded. Countries like China and Iran were on the rise. And in too many places around the world in 2008, the United States was not identified with hope and opportunity and optimism and making people's lives better, but with torture and militarism in Guantanamo Bay, and climate change denial. Now, when President Obama was elected, in sharp contrast to his predecessor, George W. Bush, who campaigned in 2000 to implement a more humble foreign policy, but instead presided over years characterized by overreach and arrogance, Obama has followed through on what he promised to do in 2008. He promised to restore and revitalize core alliances like NATO. He promised to restore America's power at home by focusing on the economy. He said he would pursue tough engagement with adversaries like Iran. He expressed the willingness to undo outdated policies like the embargo on Cuba. He said he would reduce the U.S. role in Iraq and Afghanistan while not getting overwhelmed by massive new military engagements. He said he would modernize the military while deemphasizing military force as the primary instrument of American power, elevating diplomacy and development. He said he would rebalance American statecraft to the Asian Pacific. He said he would try to involve Congress more meaningfully in decisions about the use of force. He said he would execute a more lethal fight against terrorists while ending excesses like torture. And he said he would pursue bold policy initiatives on issues like trade, climate change, and nuclear disarmament. This is what Obama was elected to do eight years ago, and that's what he did, and that's success. Now, looking out at the world, we'll be talking a lot tonight about how complicated it is, and we'll hear from our opponents about how things have been mishandled and could have been done better. We're going to hear a lot about weakness. We're going to hear a lot about leading from behind. The world has its share of challenges. But let's try to have a little bit of historical humility here. If we were sitting here in November 1968, we'd be talking about 500,000 Americans in south Vietnam, Soviet tanks in Prague, an American political system ripping itself apart on the streets. If we were sitting here in November 1980, we'd be talking about American hostages in Iran, Soviets in Afghanistan, and a worldwide energy crisis that was leading to gas lines. And of course, eight years ago, November 2008, we'd be talking about the great recession and the aftermath of the post 9/11 years in foreign policy. So, we judge a president's success not on whether the world is complicated or not or whether there are threats, but what position is the U.S. in to do something about it? What is the state of our economic, diplomatic, and military power around the world? What is the health of our alliances? What is the state of our global leadership? Now, to judge Obama, think of it this way. In terms of America's power in the world, would you rather be Barack Obama taking the baton from George W. Bush and what he left behind, or would you rather be Donald Trump taking the baton from Barack Obama and what he has left behind? Well, ask yourselves, why is it that America's allies are so worried about what is to come with Donald Trump as president? Why have America's adversaries  why are they cheering? Why did Russia work so hard to undermine the candidacy of Barack Obama's chosen successor, Hillary Clinton? Is it because Obama was failing? Now, the stakes for our future could not be higher, and the right choice for tonight's question could not be clearer. I ask for your support against the resolution."

    "data": "Well, that was a very interesting set of remarks by Derek Chollet, who is genuinely a friend of mine. A lot of really questionable propositions and some  a lot of rhetorical questions. And I'll just start with one. Why do our allies around the world worry about Trump? It's not because Obama is a success. It's because they're afraid Trump is nuts. As Kristen Silverberg foretold, our opponents are going to talk a lot about George W. Bush, they're going to talk a lot about the economy. There'll be a lot of adjectives. Let me turn to some nouns. Russia. In July of 2009, the president launched the socalled Russia reset in a speech in Moscow in which he said  and I quote  There's a 19th century view that we are destined to vie for spheres of influence and that great powers must forge competing blocks to balance one another. These assumptions are wrong. Well, it is little wonder that in 2014, when Russia invaded and seized Crimea, and then invaded eastern Ukraine, both places it still is  a country whose borders it had guaranteed. All his Secretary of State could do was to splutter, It's a 19th century act in the 21st century. When Russia fostered civil war in eastern Ukraine itself and then sent soldiers there, the Obama administration was chagrined. And today, as Russian air power smashes Syrian cities, slaughtering civilians, the administration is appropriately appalled. And when the Russian government attempts and perhaps succeeded in disrupting our political system by all kinds of things, including hacks into the Democratic National Committee's computers, the administration is embarrassingly silent. The Russian reset was a failure, thoroughly and unambiguously. There can be no doubt that our relations with Russia are worse today than they have been at any time since the end of the Cold War. Another failure, President Obama's  came in, promising to end the wars upon which we had been engaged. He told us in 2011 that that tied of wars is receding and every war must end. He declared, in May of 2013, that he had indeed ended the war in Iraq. He came in, of course, promising in his campaign in 2008, the twin objectives of finishing the fight against alQaeda, a direct quote, and ending the war in Iraq. How has he done? Again, the facts. He has launched us on our third war in Iraq against an outgrowth of alQaeda, which he once dismissed at the JV team, but, of course, we know today as the Islamic State. His administration has actually spent as much as, and by some counts more, on war than did that of President Bush. He has presided over a vast campaign of drone strikes around the world. He launched a war in Libya without  and this is interesting, based on what Derek was just saying about his attitude towards Congress  without an authorization of the use of military force from Congress. I would remind you that President Bush actually did get an authorization for the use of military force in Iraq from Congress. The results of that war, by the way, include thousands of migrants fleeing to Europe from that wretched country, often drowning or dying of exposure along the way. His record in Iraq, one that in 2010, Vice President Biden hailed as one of the great achievements of this administration, has been shattered beyond all hopes of putting back together. Rather than finishing, as he promised he would, the war with alQaeda by killing Osama Bin Laden, that organization and its affiliates have taken new and in some ways more menacing forms. He said that the Syrian war must end and Bashar alAssad must go. But the war continues and Assad is not going. The Obama administration claimed to have disposed of the Syrian arsenal of chemical weapons. But, according to the United Nations, the fact is the Syrian government continues to use chemical weapons to this day. He has not even been able to deliver on what was an unambiguous, admittedly symbolic, but very important goal for him. You remember how many times he promised he would shut the prison at Guantanamo Bay. He failed to end the wars he said he would end. And whether or not we excuse these failures  and we may very well excuse them. We may blame them on all kinds of things other than the fault of Barack Obama. The fact is, he failed to do the things he said he would do. And what of the future? Kristen talked about nuclear weapons. In Prague, in 2009, President Obama promised a world without nuclear weapons. Kristen's talked about Iran. Remember, the Russian government today routinely invokes nuclear threats against Western Europe. Most nuclear powers other than the United States are modernizing their nuclear arsenals. Four out of five North Korean nuclear tests have occurred on the watch of this administration. And in fact, North Korea is building an intercontinental ballistic missile which will be able to reach the United States. And it has detonated bombs roughly the size of the Hiroshima or Nagasaki bombs. Ladies and gentlemen, in foreign policy, there are no prizes for effort, for good intentions, for noble aspirations, for bad luck. There are only results. That is how administrations are judged, must be judged. And by that standard, the Obama foreign policy has failed."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you, John, and Eliot, Kristen, Derek. It's great to be here with all of you and to have what I think is really a very important debate. To listen to our opponents, really, nothing has gone right for the United States on the world stage for the past eight years. Barack Obama has emboldened enemies. He has left allies uncertain. He has let bad behavior go unpunished. But these claims do not stand up to scrutiny, and most of you know that these claims do not hold up. Like every president before him, Barack Obama's foreign policy has had missteps. It has not been perfect. But a failure? Like Nixon in Vietnam? Like George W. Bush and the Iraq War that we still cannot escape? As Derek demonstrated, Obama left the country not weaker, but stronger, and he did so despite the most difficult circumstances to confront any president since World War II. Those of you who view President Obama's foreign policy as a failure are either scoring some cheap political points or they're making two critical mistakes. First, they view the challenges Obama has been unable to overcome as catastrophic, when in fact, they are the drama and tragedy that always is world events. Again, as Derek alluded to, if you look back over the decades. They suggest that there are easy solutions, if Obama would just leave. But the prescription of the commentariat is generally a return to the same mistakes of reckless overcommitment that brought us to the catastrophe  to catastrophe by 2008. In that year alone, 469 Americans died in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we spent hundreds of billions of dollars. We were spending 10 to $12 billion a month for results that don't look a lot better than what we are having  what we're managing to do today with far less commitment. Obama was elected precisely on his promise to avoid these kinds of grievous mistakes. Second, the absolutist critics of Obama ignore or distort the successes of the Obama administration to fit their narrative of failure. The  this is  this does a great disservice to Obama and to America's national security by expanding fissures that will lead to wild and dangerous swings at how America relates to the world. Will we support our allies or abandon them? Will we stand by our agreements or tear them up? Will we lead or will we turn inward? I want to spend some time running through some successes and challenges that actually make it clear, despite what our opponents say, that Obama's foreign policy is not a failure. In 2009, an Iranian nuclear bomb seemed inevitable. The Bush administration had tried and failed to get negotiations going. Observers, including Eliot, noted with real concern that Iran had massive stockpiles of uranium, including enough highly enriched uranium for at least one bomb  at that time. And a plutonium pathway to the heavy water reactor at Iraq. Without any inspectors, the world was blind to all Iranian nuclear activities. The Obama administration took the threat seriously. Our intelligence services worked to slow Iran's enrichment, including with offensive cyber operations to destroy their centrifuges. American military planners prepared for targeted attacks, keeping every option on the table for the president. American diplomats, led by Hillary Clinton, secured the most restrictive and effective sanctions in history  sanctions that could only work with cooperation from Moscow, Beijing, and Europe. And in secret, the administration kept open the door to talks and worked with other UN Security Council members and Germany to secure a deal. Today, Iran has no highlyenriched uranium. It has insufficient uranium of any kind to make even one bomb. Iran has no plutonium pathway, and highly intrusive inspections help verify compliance. Could they cheat? Possibly. But our military option would still be on the table and with much more information for planners. Are Iranians still supporting terror and brutality at home and in the region? They are. But they are now 10 to 15 years away from a nuclear bomb instead of weeks or months, which makes every other security challenge more manageable. That is a foreign policy success. What about climate? We know that climate change threatens humanity and will increase instability, violence, and population displacement. In October of 2015, it looked like the Paris round of talks were going to fail, but the Obama administration was not going to take no for an answer. They pulled together, developed in developing countries that were most impacted by climate, rising sea levels to drive talks forward. They worked over years with China to develop a relationship so that they could come up with a pact whereby the two biggest emitters would lead the world to make Paris a success. Unless a new American president tears up the Paris agreement, the world will actually be on the path, for the first time, to start reducing carbon emissions. That is a foreign policy success. One of the failures that was just noted was Crimea. Vladimir Putin's invasion of Crimea was no more the fault of Barack Obama than his invasion of Georgia in 2008 was the fault of President Bush. We should judge these presidents by how they responded. President Bush flew troops  Georgian troops back from Iraq to Russia  to Georgia. They were routed by the Russians. He did some limited sanctions. They did nothing. Sanctions that Obama created with Europe are actually punishing Russia. There will be a cost. It shows that countries will stand together for principles even when their own interests are challenged. The fact is, today, majorities of the world view America and Barack Obama favorably. According to Pew Data from June, people are starting to again view America as the world's leading economic power and they trust Obama to do the right thing. As he ends his term, he has a 60 percent approval rating. We believe that you will think as we do that Obama's theme song upon exiting this administration will be You're Going to Miss Me When I’m Gone. So, I am hopeful you will join us in opposing the motion."

    "data": "Thank you. And thank you so much for having me here. So, I was asked to start off with a little bit of the legal framework. Why do we actually do this? So, some of you may know that our Constitution requires that they re‐draw our Congressional and state legislative district lines every 10 years. And as our country grew after its founding, it didn't grow equally, as you might guess. Some towns and counties grew larger than others, and some jurisdictions actually took account of that and changed their district lines, but others didn't. So, for an example, in Tennessee, from 1901 to 1961, the legislature just ignored the requirement to re‐draw district lines. Another example, in Alabama, you had ‐‐ in addition to the literacy tests and poll taxes that kept African Americans from registering to vote ‐‐ you had mal apportionment that helped preserve the power of segregation in places like Lowndes County, Alabama. In that county, you had 15,000 ‐‐ approximately ‐‐ residents who had as many representative in the Alabama Senate as the 600,000 residents of Birmingham's Jefferson County. Well, the Supreme Court ended this perversion of democracy in a series of landmark cases in the '60s, ruling that legislative districts had to be roughly equal in population. They're known as the one person, one vote cases. And so, district boundaries now are being re‐adjusted to account for new population information. And so, when the census is conducted at the start of the new decade, district boundaries have to be re‐drawn. And so, we have this re‐districting and gerrymandering. So, as you know, gerrymandering is nothing new. It's named after Elbridge Gerry, who was the Massachusetts governor and future vice president, who, in 1812, signed a re‐districting plan that benefited his own party. It looked a lot like a salamander. And hence, the gerrymander. But just because it was done in the past doesn't make it any less insidious and any less anti‐democratic. And now, we have these sophisticated technologies and maps that allow it to become so much worse. And as you know, maps and ‐‐ are ‐‐ tend to be drawn by the state's legislators. Legislators are very self‐ invested in this process. And this gives them the tools to figure out exactly what they want their own district and their own voters to look like for the next 10 years. And because they are ‐‐ the parties have learned that they can gain many votes by altering the mix of who votes rather than assuming the median positions of the likely electorate, and they can speak more directly to partisans and donors ‐‐ the extremes, really, through the microtargeting that is available to them. And these base voters are then the key to the primary. With districts that are configured like this, to benefit the incumbent or one party, the primary becomes the only thing that matters. And so, you can look in 2012 and 2014, where you had partisan asymmetry that was at its highest level in 40 years. And that's measured by how one party can get more seats than its votes should allow. The districts are structured not to be competitive. So, as I mentioned, the Supreme Court has raised concerns about partisan gerrymandering as being unconstitutional, as not ‐‐ when the districts are not collectively responsible to the popular will. And the reason for this is that the re‐districting requirement was essentially ‐‐ was meant to create fairness and balance. The districts were created ‐‐ the drawing was meant to keep them fair, and the populations balanced. And not ‐‐ and I will quote from a piece that was in the Washington Post by Phil Andrews, a former county councilman ‐‐ Montgomery County, Maryland. He said the 3rd District of Maryland staggers like a drunken sailor from Annapolis to Olney. And you have to look at it. You could see, it actually does kind of look like a drunken sailor staggering. That's not what the founding fathers were intending when they said that we should have this process go on. Madison actually said that the House was meant to be a numerous and changeable bodies, where the members would have a, habitual recollation of their dependence to the people. Madison said, Every new election in the states will change one half of the representatives. Well, as you know, we have elections where almost nobody in the House changes unless they happen to retire. So, we can see that we have a situation where the gerrymandering has significantly added to the level of polarization. You have districts that have no competition and hence, only the incumbent runs for re‐election because it's really not worth it for anybody else there are so few competitive districts. And that leads to disincentivizing dialogue because there's no reason to talk to somebody on the other side of the aisle because if you do and you compromise, you'll have a primary attack. And the primary, as I mentioned, is the only election that matters. So, I would just end with a couple other points about why this has contributed so significantly to the destruction of the middle. When there's only one person on the ballot or only one party that can win a district, the citizens are essentially ‐‐ have no way to hold that individual accountable. They have no choice. As a result, people stop voting. Turnout goes down. And let me remind you that primaries, and since primaries are often now the only vote matters, primaries are already a low turnout operation ‐‐ exaggerating even more how far to the extreme and out of the middle both the voters are and those people who are responding to them, the elected officials. So, I just want to quote ‐‐ to close in the same set of articles yesterday in The Washington Post, there was an expert, Ross Lawrence from the American Enterprise Institute, a Republican, who talked about why it was ‐‐ why it is that competitive elections are good for voters. He reminds us that one party dominance is a recipe for corruption and complacency. So, I ask you, give us your vote, because it's clear that gerrymandering is destroying the political center. Thank you."

    "data": "The heart of tonight's debate is the question of whether gerrymandering can be blamed for what political scientists and others have called polarization. For our purposes tonight, polarization can be thought of as the disappearance of moderate views from politics and the increased likelihood of extreme ones. The system often manifests itself in extreme differences between the two parties. Polarization can appear at two different levels. It can appear among elites like in Congress, so we see the hauling out of moderates in Congress, or it can happen in the electorate where we see the disengagement of moderate voters. The conventional wisdom among political scientists is that polarization is primarily an elite phenomenon ‐‐ at least it started there, and that's most clear in the data. Voter polarization emerged much later and is more empirically ambiguous and is often driven by other behavior. I am going to focus on the extent to which gerrymandering is related to elite polarization. My partner will take up questions of voter polarization. My focus on Congress has two ‐‐ at least two advantages. First, it's well studied, and there's a historical record of congressional voting on bills. And polarization in Congress is obviously directly pertinent to questions about the effects of gerrymandering. So, let me start with just giving you some data and some facts about polarization in Congress. So, in my work, I've measured polarization in Congress by levels of partisanship and ideological division on roll call votes on legislation. These measures have varied greatly over 140 years ‐‐ since Reconstruction, which I mentioned before. It was obviously high during Reconstruction in the Gilded Age, through about 1920. It was low from the 1930s to the 1970s. And a dramatic growth began in the late 1970s. And as I said before, now we're at an all‐time high. Second fact, the House and the Senate have polarized more or less in tandem. There's no significant differences between the trend and the turning points between those two chambers. I and the data also suggest the trends are very long term with very few abrupt changes reflecting the obvious role of deep cultural changes, economic and technological shifts and demography. Given these long‐term trends, I argue that it's very doubtful that any small change in electoral procedure such as the way we draw districts can really account for what is going on. So, the first point I want to make in support of that argument is to go to the theoretical argument that people have made about how it is that gerrymandering is supposed ‐‐ partisan gerrymandering ‐‐ is supposed to increase polarization. I would argue it's very important not to conflate partisan gerrymandering, the attempt that majority parties do to try to maximum number of seats, and incumbency protection gerrymandering, the role that incumbents might play in creating safe seats. They're not the same, and they're very different. So, let me give you an example to show how the argument underlying this case doesn't make any sense. So, consider a state with two districts. And we'll say that party A has an advantage across the state. Say they get 53 percent of the vote, so they're a slight majority party. They get to draw the district boundaries and can do so to get any allocation of partisans into districts. In such a scenario, party A has essentially two choices; one, it can do the partisan gerrymandering. It can create two identical districts so there's at least 53 percent in both of those districts. Or it can do incumbency protection. It can create a safe party A district and a safe party B district. Now, note that the one with the safe districts is the incumbency protection gerrymandering. It's not the partisan gerrymandering. The partisan gerrymandering gives the incumbents of the majority party much narrower margins than the incumbency protection. So, it's really not the ‐‐ it's really not ‐‐ partisan gerrymandering ‐‐ its effects on polarization just aren't clear theoretically. But I'm an empiricist, so let me talk a little bit about the data against the proposition. First of all, as I've already alluded to the Senate. Since the Dakotas were split in the 1890s to give the Republicans four Senators instead of two, the Senate has not been gerrymandered. Yet the data shows it’s just as polarized is the House of Representatives. Small states can’t be gerrymandered. They're states with one member of Congress. They send extreme numbers to Congress all the time. Recall a certain Vermont senator who was a Socialist until he became a Democrat. That's from a state with one House member. If you look at state legislatures, lower and upper chambers are equally polarized. Lower chambers are easier to gerrymander than upper chambers. Why are they the same if this is what's going on? Turns out, if you look at the geography, extreme partisan districts are no more frequent than extreme counties. So, the underlying geography of the United States is one that's quite polarized and the districts themselves are not much more polarized than the underlying geography. And then finally, and most importantly, polarization does not seem to increase disproportionately around reapportionment years. It increases in off years, every year. In fact, since 1977, it's increased every year, and the increases around the apportionment are no bigger than they are around other years. Just a few other points of more suppressed sophisticated evidence. It's important to note that since the 1970s, the main growth in polarization measured by the differences between the parties in the voting records has been the polarization that’s occurred in partisan competitive districts. It's not because there are few competitive districts, even though districts where Democratic and Republican voters are at rough equal strength, the same members of Congress were just as polarized as the other types of districts. Finally, more sophisticated evidence based on simulations where we can simulate any type of districting we want, partisan, incumbency, gerrymandering, this type of gerrymandering versus that type of gerrymandering shows they have very, very little effect on levels of polarization. So, I conclude based on the theory, which I don't think makes any sense, and the data, which doesn't support it, that the proposition should be redacted."

    "data": "I want to tell you all a story about what happened in Florida in December of 2010, just a few weeks after upwards of 60 percent of the state's voters in 2010, a big Tea Party year ‐‐ voters couldn't agree on much of anything in 2010. They did back two Constitutional amendments mandating that all redistricting be conducted without any partisan intent. It did not take but a couple of weeks for the smartest Republicans strategists in the state, guys who run firms like Data Targeting and Strategic Direction, guys who make deep in the six figures every year just to do things like be a redistricting coordinator, to gather at GOP headquarters in Tallahassee with legislative leaders and top aids and bold‐faced names from Washington. The goal, launching a sophisticated and highly concealed campaign to run two redistricting processes in Florida, one public, one in the shadows; both in their control and loaded with partisan intent. They might have gotten away with it except the lawsuits brought by the reformers uncovered the meeting's agenda. Questions like, Communication with outside lawyers, how can we make that work? Evolution of maps: should they start less compliant and evolve through the process or should the first man be as compliant as possible and then change very little? A furious federal judge in 2014 declared several of these districts unconstitutional, orders new maps in light of a conspiracy to manipulate and insulate redistricting that made a mockery out of the claim transparency and tainted the process with improper partisan intent. Why? If the professor and his table who has partisanship and polarization correct with these highly accomplished and highly paid strategists and elected officials take such risks just to violate constitutional amendments? Perhaps the politicos know something truer about the district lines, something like this: that all components of a successful congressional race, including recruitment, message development, and resource allocation rests on the congressional district lines. And this was an area where Republicans had an unquestioned advantage. Those are not my words. Those come from the triumphant 2012 annual report of Chris Jankowski's Republican State Leadership Committee, a victory lap after his party retained a 33‐seat majority in the house that year despite 1.4 million fewer votes, thanks to their audacious reinvention of the oldest political trick in the book, the gerrymander and the strategy call REDMAP. We are here to ask whether gerrymandering has destroyed the political center. Yes, it did. The center has been an endangered species for some time, yes. But its destruction accelerates in 2010 and 2011 just as Republicans take what Harvard political scientists Theda Skocpol describes as the biggest lurch in one direction, the right, as anyone began recording legislators voting record at a deep electoral discontent settled into our politics. We all know that this is true. The center has been erased with the click of a map maker's mouse. It's been drawn away. We are a 50/50 nation, but an uncompetitive one, dominated at the legislative level by the rule of one party. The gerrymander is at the root of it. Democrats have taken the popular vote in six of the last seven elections. Ballot splitting reached a 100 plus year low in 2012. And, yet, in the last six years, Republicans have claimed their biggest sustained congressional majorities ever, even in years when they get fewer votes. In 2010, they also ended parity at the state legislative level. They now control 67 of 98 state legislative chambers and 100s more seats than Democrats. So why is it that, despite regularly winning a majority of voters, Democrats have no power? It is because Chris understands something his partner wants to dismiss. When you draw the lines, you make the rules. And, when you draw the lines with the breathtaking technological tools available today, you make the rules for a decade and these rules changed forever in 2010 with REDMAP. Chris masterminded this strategy in 2009 and 2010 with the stated goal of flipping state legislature, ensuring Republicans to be the only people in the room when the new district lines were drawn in 2011. The rationale was straightforward, he writes – REDMAP’s report writes. Controlling the redistricting process in these states would have the greatest impact on determining how both state legislative and congressional district boundaries would be drawn, drawing new lines in states with the most redistricting activity presented the opportunity to solidify conservative policy making and maintain a Republican stronghold in the house for the next decade. This is how you destroy, even nullify the center and advance your agenda in a 50/50 polarized world. It's polarization that has made extreme gerrymandering so effective. When we are as polarized as this, the most essential element becomes where you draw the lines, how you distribute the voters. This is how the center gets destroyed, how National Journal can find 137 congressional centrists in 2002 and four in 2012. It's how Nate Silver can find 133 swing districts to 35 between 1992 and 2012. This plan worked better than Republicans even expected. They were able in 2011 to draw 193 of the 435 districts themselves after the 2010 election. Democrats had complete control over just 44. This election year, we're down to 37 competitive states. Destroying swing districts and gutting these last outposts of centrism and debate is the goal. You could blame polarization for this. You could blame geography for this. You could blame partisanship for this. Or you can simply take the Republicans at their word. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. I was briefly a prosecutor before I became a career political hack. And what David just did reminds me of when a prosecutor gets up and starts throwing out all kinds of unflattering information to the jury, but it isn't really relevant to the charges. And so, I completely plead guilty to everything he just laid out, and that was playing by the rules and maximizing the impact on the American political system. But the question before you is, does gerrymandering cause the polarization ‐‐ which is destroying the American center? And so, what I want to talk about is the fact that the swing voter in America has been disappearing for the last 20 years, and is just reaching a ‐‐ we've just reached a new height in that. I would point you to a New York Times article in August of 2012, written by Rebecca Berg. And she looked at all the academic research available at that time. She interviewed experts on both sides of the aisle. And she concluded that even among so‐called self‐identified swing voters in America at that time, half of them vote for one party or other party all the time. They want to identify themselves as not being affiliated with a particular party, but if you look at their actual voting behavior, half of them already have a team. They have a jersey on; they just have a coat over. And so, I think that's important. And if you take that ‐‐ say there's ‐‐ 10 or 15 percent is the typical national number of swing voters. We talk about playing this game between the 40‐yard lines, et cetera. You take half of that, and you say it's 7.5 percent. And you take that, and you ignore California and Texas, and some of the bigger states that skew one way or the other, and you try to apply it to our electoral system in the battleground states. And from what I can tell, you've got about 500,000 households that are really up for grabs in a national election. And that, to me, is polarization. I mean, we have gotten to the point where we have our jerseys, and we put them on come election time. We try not to, but by the time the election rolls around, we have them on, for the most part. The other thing to point out is, Pew has done quite a bit of research the last 25 years. They do this value study. They've updated it 14 times. In 2014, they issued a report that's called The Polarization in the American Public. And one of the things they cite in there ‐‐ there's a couple points I want to leave you with. First is the number ‐‐ the percentage of voters in America who had ‐‐ who identify solely and extremely with the liberal or conservative view has doubled, from 10 to 21 percent. And extrapolate that out to likely voters, and it's a bigger part of the electorate. But what really got me was that the percentage of voters who believe that the other party that they oppose ‐‐ that they threaten the well‐being of the nation ‐‐ that's the wording of the question, the well‐being of the nation ‐‐ that percentage has doubled to 37 percent of Republicans felt that way, in ’14 ‐ ‐ and 27 percent of Democrats. That's over 60 percent of the voters. Six in 10 Americans think that the other party, should they get complete control, would threaten the very foundations of the country ‐‐ the well‐being. And I'm not even one of them. But six in 10. So, we start with a very small narrow path, if you want to talk about who the swing voters ‐‐ who's actually persuadable and who switches. I'm not saying they don't exist. But if you look at the data ‐‐ that was from 1994 to 2004. In 20 years, we got more polarized, and it had nothing to do with the gerrymandering that took place after 2010. I mean, it just doesn't. I mean, you cannot look at 20, 25 years of history and a clear trend, and then say, Oh, but these last few years have made the difference. The other part is ‐ ‐ I'd like to talk about briefly is what I actually do, which is a political consultant, and run campaigns. And another thing I see in voter behavior ‐‐ and voters are the consumers that we as consultants and politicians are trying to gain. And they have siloed themselves off in America, in self‐reinforcing silos, through social media, through where they live and who they associate with, and through, obviously, the ‐‐ you know, the notorious cable news networks. And so, that voters across the spectrum are getting what they want to hear. They block out what they don't want to hear. And that has further, I would argue, created this polarization in the data that I ‐‐ that Pew has picked up on, that all that technology and all that social media, it's just gone up. And for people like me, we take advantage of that. Yes, we do a poll at the beginning. We do research and we do polling and ‐‐ before we start a race, and we look at how we're going to build that 51 percent. But then we start slicing and dicing it, and we say, How are we going to talk to that group of voters without this group of voters seeing it? What goes on TV is usually the last thing, it's the least efficient cost in a campaign, and in terms of the marginal votes that can change, and it's the least important. Today's elections are about turning out the people that already agree with you. And we ‐‐ and we'll touch on that in the conclusion later. Finally, just a show of hands, how many members of the NRA are here today? None. All right, well, I'll keep my hand up. So, if you're not a member of the NRA, you've never been subjected to the deluge of phone calls, stuff on your phone, social media, online outreach, mailbox, door knocks with strong Second Amendment issues. But I can assure you it goes on. And because the NRA wouldn't admit, but in most instances, the gun issue probably works against them net‐net, they are still very effective because of all the tools and the trends that I just mentioned at motivating those single‐issue voters. And I would submit to you that that happens with every segment of the electorate. Both parties have their different blocks they have to get out and how to talk to them. The key is to do it without making the other side notice or get excited. And that's polarization, folks."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you very much for the introduction and the opportunity to address and affirm the resolution to give undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship. As a daughter of immigrants who came to this country with few resources but with big dreams, it is an honor to be on this stage and to talk about this topic. The issue hardly needs introduction. In this painfully long presidential race, the candidates have discussed the 11 million. Donald Trump has said he would aggressively deport them and their five million U.S. citizen children, and Secretary Clinton has said that she supports a path to citizenship for those who meet certain qualifications. So, the candidates have talked about it. And the American people have thought about it. Recent polls from the New York times, Washington Post, CNN, Gallup, even Fox finds that between 72 and 88 percent of Americans back either citizenship or legalization for the undocumented over deportation. But tonight, you guys get to decide. What's the right choice for the country? So, what I'm going to do is to address three questions that I think are really important for you all to understand the context of the resolution and the implications of your decision. The first is, who are the undocumented? The next is, why are they undocumented? And finally, what are the options for undocumented? My dear friend and partner Marielena is going to discuss the benefits for all Americans for a path to citizenship. So, let's get started with the who. The undocumented are settled, longtime residents. In 2014, the average undocumented adult had lived in the United States for 13andahalf years. If they have a U.S. citizen child, they have lived here for 15 years. So, these aren't accidental tourists. They're not folks who decide to spend an extra day at Disney. They are home. And so, when people say, Send them home, they're missing the point. This is their home. They're settled. And like many of us, they live in families. Nearly threequarters have children and twothirds have a spouse or a sibling here in the U.S. Undocumented immigrants overwhelmingly live in the family, but they don't live with just each other. They live in mixedstatus families. So, it's really common to have an undocumented father, a green card holder mom, a teenage son who is undocumented but qualifies for temporary deferral from deportation, and a U.S. citizen child. About 17 million of us live in families that are like that. So, aside from being in families, about seven million of the undocumented are workers. That's about 5 percent of our work force. They own homes. According to the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, one in three undocumented families owns their own home, and they pay taxes, like all of us. They pay sales tax. They pay property taxes. And many pay income tax. In fact, estimates are that local and state governments net about $11.6 billion a year from undocumented workers. So they live with families, they have children, they work, they pay taxes, and they own their homes. That's the who. The question that I get the most often, though, in talking about the undocumented is why? Why are they just not getting in line and getting their green card? I have one relative who insist that's there is a window at the post office that if they just went there, that they could get a green card. And I have to have Thanksgiving with this person soon, and I just can't convince her that there is no line, right? Everybody's got someone like that at the Thanksgiving table. Love them. So the U.S. immigration system is insanely complex. And it hasn't been updated in any meaningful way since 1990. So to understand how out of sync the system is, you just need to remember one number, and that's 5,000, because that's how many visas there are for workers, like the person who drove me to the airport this morning or the person who's going to clean up after us after we all leave. So there's 5,000 legal channels, and that's it, for people who work in our hotels, in our restaurants, for the people who took care of my daughters when they were young, for the people who take care of my grandmother today. So what we might not be able to agree on what the number is, we can surely agree that our modern economy can't possibly satisfied bylaws that haven't been amended for 25 years. Okay. Beyond there not being legal challenge for workers, there's other obstacles, there's other limitations that are specially difficult for families. The visa backlog stretch for years. And I mean years. So we are now issuing visas to the adult, unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens from Mexico who filed for their visa in 1995. That's how long people are having to wait. And so if you're outside the U.S., you can't come visit because if you're trying to get a permanent visa, they won't give you a temporary one. Beyond the long waiting time, our laws say that if you've been in the U.S. illegally for longer than six months, you're subject to a penalty, that you can't get legal status for 10 years. So the ironic thing is that we have a lot of undocumented people who have a qualifying family member who could petition for them, but this bar will kick in if they leave the U.S. to get their visa. They won't be able to come back in for 10 years. What do they do? They stay. So that's a question. The last question is, what are the options? There's four, but I think there's just one solution. So we can do nothing and be okay with 11 million people living without status, spend $17 billion a year enforcing laws that don't work, knowing that folks are getting exploited, and know that it hurts us, right, because people don't come forward and report a crime, they don't come forward and report bad working conditions. Their inability to live free of fear is bad for us. We could aggressively deport them, and we could imagine what that would be like to go to schools and churches and ferret people out. Not the America we want to live in. We could give them something short of citizenship. We could just have them work here and never be able to belong. And that would undermine the fabric of our nation and lead to continued exploitation. The last, most realistic defensible option is tonight's resolution: A path to citizenship for those who qualify, clear background checks. They'll pay fees, they'll learn English, and they will be the best Americans that we could have. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you, everyone, and thanks to Intelligence Squared for hosting this event, and to our counterparts for what will be a spirited debate tonight. As John mentioned at the outset, National Review earlier this year published an entire issue of our magazine devoted to attacking Donald Trump. Now, I know most of you probably would have expected Donald Trump to receive this issue with his usual sense of grace and calm equilibrium. It wasn't so. He didn't take it well. He lashed out. And it was right around this time that Trump infamously said that he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue, shoot someone dead, and his poll numbers would go up. And that's when the allstaff memo went out at National Review for everyone to avoid Fifth Avenue until further notice. And actually, even I, we were considering some Trumplike tactics. Tonight we are considering demanding that our counterparts be subjected to drug tests before being allowed on stage. We are thinking about interjecting the word wrong randomly throughout the entire evening. We are even considering stalking menacingly behind them when they spoke. Actually, to be honest, I really would have preferred to have Alek Baldwin as my debate partner tonight rather than Steve but in all seriousness, we're delighted to be here, and we do want to engage obviously the substance of this resolution. And we should just be clear at the outset what this debate is about. It isn't about whether there are illegal immigrants in this country who exemplary people and have moving stories. There are. It isn't about whether illegal immigrants come to this country and overwhelmingly work. They do. It isn't about whether we should give them amnesty or legalization to socalled dreamers who came here or were brought here illegally at a very young age. It isn't even about whether we should have a blanket amnesty or legalization for every illegal immigrant in the country no matter what. No. You can agree with every single one of those positions and still not support giving illegal immigrants the most prized possession in the world, one that tens of millions of lawabiding people all around the world covet, which is United States citizenship. That's how radical our opponents' position is tonight. I submit to you that even if you disagree with Steve and I on some of the policy, you can still reject this resolution. I would go further. I would say even if you think Steve and I are heartless bastards or, to coin a phrase, bad hombres, you can still reject this resolution. It is our position that we should oppose all radicalism on this issue. We should reject the radicalism of Donald Trump who has absurdly talked of mass deportation. And we should reject this resolution which is manifestly unfair to all the people who, like suckers, play by the rules of our immigration system, people who wait years to come here legally, people who come here on a work or a tourist visa and when it expires, actually go home. Remember, this resolution has been tried before. In 1986, we had an amnesty and a pathway to citizenship for 3 million illegal immigrants in this country. That was supposed to solve the problem. It actually made it worse. We have four times as many illegal immigrants in this country now, and if this resolution were to become policy, we would have millions more. By the way, the evidence from 1986 on the ground suggests, as a practical matter, even for most illegal immigrants, this resolution goes too far. In 1986, illegal immigrants were happy to take the amnesty or the legalization. But most of them, at the end of the day, didn't take the incredibly generous offer of citizenship. So what's the better policy option here? It's very simple. It's enforcement. Now, we don't need to build a wall, even a big, beautiful wall. But we do need to do more on the border. And very importantly, we need to do more to stop employers from hiring cheap illegal labor that creates a jobs magnet to come here. If it's harder to work here illegally, fewer people will come, and fewer people will stay. And then we can finely get an immigration system that will serve the interests of our workers first, who are natives and also, by the way, legal immigrants. Now, Steve will go into more detail about the real fiscal and economic costs of this resolution. But suffice it to say if you care about income inequality, if you care about stagnant wages, you should oppose this resolution. And let me just leave you with one last thought. We are a big, generous country. But our citizenship is precious. And whatever else you think about immigration policy, if you think we should have a broadly open system, or if you think we should have a tightly restrictive system, or maybe you think it should be somewhere in between, the bare minimum requirement for becoming a citizen  a citizen  of the United States of America should be abiding by her laws. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you, John. Good evening, and thank you for the opportunity to argue for this motion tonight. I'm an immigrant from Colombia, a proud naturalized U.S. citizen, and I'll be voting on November 8th. I firmly believe in the promise of America, a promise which my parents, Acturo and Theresa [spelled phonetically], believed in. They were textile workers. They had a second and fifth grade education. They made the courageous and selfless decision to come to the United States. Why? For a better economic future for their children just like millions of immigrants before and after them have done, including many of you who are listening and watching tonight. We're asking you to vote for this motion to give undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship for three reasons. One, we are a nation of laws. Two, we benefit economically, and three, it's good for our society. First, as a lawyer, I know that we are a nation of laws, but I also know that not all laws are created equal. We at the National Immigration Law Center work very closely with policy makers to draft and defend good laws, but we also sue over unjust laws like Arizona's infamous racial profiling anti immigrant law SP1070. The rule of law is important, because it provides predictability, consistency, and when applied well, not discrimination. Unfortunately, our immigration law is none of that. Our immigration laws are dysfunctional and out of date. We elect Congress to represent our best interests to solve the nation's most pressing issues and to update those laws when it's necessary. Immigration is so important that it's spanned political walls. Most Americans agree with Angie and me that the status quo on immigration is unacceptable and that a path to citizenship is the way to go, but Congress has failed to act in the last 25 years. Instead, we have a system which U.S. citizen children go to school not knowing whether they're going to see their mother or father at the end of the night. You have folks who as Angie described have lived here for decades, but they still don't know whether they're days, months, or years away from being deported. You even have people in Louisiana who can't marry the person they love simply because they lack the documents to do so. How many times have you heard people like our opponents say that undocumented immigrants broke the law and therefore they should not be rewarded? Not only is this false, but it overlooks our own role in complicity in creating this dysfunctional system. Here's the thing. We've been sending confusing and hypocritical messages for the last quarter century. We hang a keep out sign on our border while our economy sends help wanted messages. Similarly, our federal government says it's unlawful for you to work here without authorization, but if you're working and you're earning wages you must pay taxes. Undocumented workers can't get a social security number, but the federal government gives them a tax ID number to pay their federal taxes, which benefits all of us. This is dysfunctional. What we need instead is predictability, consistency, and laws that can be applied in a nondiscriminatory fashion. Congress must create a clear road map that shows restaurant workers, nurses, entrepreneurs, and all the citizens in waiting how to get into a line for citizenship, as well as to create a line for others. The second reason to vote for the motion is that the economic benefits are clear. The road map we create should focus on the contributions that people who are here are already making to our communities, economy, and society. At a practical level, it's good for our bottom line. Recent studies show that when young immigrants who have been able to get work authorization and temporary protection from deportation like Martin Batalla Pedal who is here tonight, we all benefit from that. They're able to more fully participate in society. They're able to buy big ticket items like cars and homes. All of that helps our state coffers. People like Martin have been able to lift up their families, communities, and society as well. According to a recent study  to recent surveys, their wages have increased by 42 percent. And many of them are also investing in themselves by pursuing their educational dreams. The Congressional Budget Office, in 2013, predicted that immigration reform would increase the GDP by 3.3 percent in 10 years. The greatest cost, perhaps, is that of unrealized potential. I'm talking about people like Chris Mercado, who is here tonight as well. He's an entrepreneur who dreams of using his technological expertise to address society's problems. Chris is a New Yorker. He's lived in Queens in the same house since he was age 6, when he arrived from the Philippines. He is an aspiring citizen and represents American innovation. Yet, there's no way  no line to get in, no paper to fill out  for him to become a citizen of this country. Finally, creating a path to citizenship is good for our society. It's in line with our American values of fairness, equality, and dignity. It recognizes the 11 million undocumented immigrants for who they really are  Americans at heart and citizens in waiting. Our opponents want you think of undocumented immigrants as outsiders, as others. You heard from Rich. They see citizenship as a prized possession. I would argue that such a viewpoint has led us down dangerous and exclusionary paths before. Our country has had plenty of experience excluding entire segments of our population. When we denied African Americans and women the right to vote, Congress acted. When there was rampant discrimination against African Americans, Congress acted and passed the Civil Rights Act. Your vote tonight is a message to Congress to act and provide a path to citizenship. Thank you."

    "data": "This is exactly the kind of unemotional, factdriven debate that we'd like to have and we need more of. So, my hats off to you for an excellent program. And your goals seem to be unassailable. Let's start with some facts about the illegal immigrant population. Rich talked a lot about general principles  rule of law, it repeats the mistakes of the past. I'm going to give you a little bit more information to help you think about this question. One of the most important facts we know about illegal immigrants is that, on average, they have about a 10th grade education. There are some lesseducated immigrants than that  illegal immigrants  and some are more. But on average, that's what it is. The overwhelming majority have only a high school education or they didn't graduate high school. Actually, we think a majority didn't graduate high school in their home countries before they came. This tells us a lot. It tells us what their likely income is going to be in the modern American economy. It tells us, equally important, which Americans are going to be competing with illegal immigrants for jobs. Now, we think there are about seven, eight million illegal immigrants currently holding jobs in the United States. And the good news is, the vast majority of Americans don't compete with them for jobs. They're at the very bottom of the labor market  on average, given their skills. But the problem is that it's the poorest Americans who do compete with them for jobs  Americans who  getting out of prison, Americans with a disability, Americans who themselves didn't graduate high school. And that also includes lot of less educated legal immigrants. My opponents tonight identify strongly with illegal immigrants, and I understand that, and I think that's some to their credit. But we also have to keep in mind that Americans, even if they're not wellrepresented in this room  the roughly 13 million who don't have a high school education, who research shows compete directly with illegal immigrants  if we let every illegal immigrant stay, the job competition stays. Now, you might say, Well, they might not undercut the nativeborn anymore, but the bottom line is, you still fundamentally increase the supply of labor precisely among the most vulnerable part of the labor market. Just to give you one statistic  of high school dropouts in the United States who are of working age, only 42 percent have a job right now. It's a historic low. Their real wages have declined. We don't have a shortage of people without a high school education. And they have done extremely poorly. Let me talk very briefly about the impact on taxpayers. Again, what we know is people who don't have a lot of education don't make a lot of money. They use a lot in services, including illegal immigrants. The National Academies of Science just released a study indicating that even if you project out 75 years, people who come to America with a high school degree or less are an enormous fiscal drain. On average, about $150,000 during their lifetime. And amnesty, a legalization or citizenship, will make immigrants eligible  illegal immigrants  for even more programs, likely increasing that. Legalization doesn't change the underlying demographics about educational attainment and the moderate American economy. The total cost of letting all illegal immigrants, saying  giving them citizenship is likely to be about a trillion dollars to taxpayers. No, it's true. Illegal immigration does make the economy bigger. More people is a bigger economy. But there's no evidence it makes the nativeborn richer. What it mainly does is benefits the illegal immigrants themselves if all of them get to stay, and it tends to come at the expense of taxpayers and the poorest and most vulnerable American workers at the bottom end of the labor market. Now let me talk about something very briefly. And this is important. There's no administrative capacity to even process 10 million applications. Our immigration service just gave out citizenship to 900 criminal aliens. They were all due to be deported. But the system is so screwed up. The bureaucracy is so overwhelmed they all got citizenship instead. When we had our last amnesty in '86, between onethird and onequarter of the people who got it then did so fraudulently. Now, in the real world, any legislation that passes will be a massive undertaking, a huge giveaway to special interests. In 2013, the legislation that would have amnestied the illegal immigrants was longer than the New Testament and was filled with all kinds of special interest perks be and giveaways. It was so complicated no one read it. Everybody admitted they hadn't read it. And that's exactly what we're debating here. If we were to move to give citizenship to illegal immigrants, not only can't we process all those applications, but it would be the kind of legislation that we pass so often in Washington where I live, one that no one reads and few people understand. Now, what's the alternative here? Well, the alternative is to start with something sensible, not rewarding everyone no broke the law. The alternative is they actually begin by enforcing the law. We're not doing that right now. Do you know that we have over 900,000 people in the United States who've actually been ordered deported by immigration court, but we never followed up, so they're all still here basically. That's our immigration system. You know how many employers  there are about a hundred thousand employers that hire illegal immigrants. Do you know how many got arrested in 2015? Maybe 50. That's our enforcement regime. So I'm proposing we actually try something we haven't tried before, which is enforcing the law. We control the border, we go after the employers who hire the illegal immigrants. We get the cooperation of local law enforcement. If even some illegal immigrants go home, it's good for American workers, it's good for taxpayers. It restores the rule of law and it avoids this kind of radical idea that we should be handing out citizenship. And we don't need some big piece of legislation. Just enforcing current law would go a long way to moving the ball forward. Thank you."

    "data": "Good evening, everyone. It's a great honor to be here to talk about one of the most important issues, I think, we face in the healthcare system. And it  there are many issues that aren't getting proper discussion in our presidential debate, but this is one that has actually united those candidates. Candidates who rarely agree on anything have actually both talked about this challenge. And as we think about this debate tonight, and this conversation, I wanted to start off with where I think this debate really should start off. Which is with consumers, and people affected by high drug prices. I just want us all to keep in mind throughout this evening, moms who are working hard every day, moms like Lauren Bauman [spelled phonetically], who has had cancer for 10 years and relies on a daily dose of Gleevec, a cancer drug whose price has more than tripled since 2001. Even with insurance, her copay is as high as $2,200 a month. $2,200 a month. That has driven her family into bankruptcy and forced her and her 9yearold daughter to move out of their house. And she says she has no choice, because without this pill, she will die. That's  that is a terrible, terrible story. But there are stories like that throughout our country. Stories of 70yearold diabetes patients who rely on insulin and whose price has tripled in a decade; the mom and her son who both need  who have severe allergies and both need an EpiPen, and have to split it between the two of them. Now, we're going to hear a lot tonight about who is responsible for these situations. I have to remind everyone that pharmaceutical costs in the United States are higher than in any developed country. What does that mean? Consumers around the world are paying much less than consumers in the United States. Why is that? That's because pharmaceutical companies charge us for higher costs. They charge us more than they charge anyone else. Now, their response is usually that we need innovation, and that's what's driving costs. But when you really look at it, the truth is that pharmaceutical companies  the vast majority of pharmaceutical companies are spending more on marketing than they are on research. They're spending, in fact, much more, usually, on marketing than on research. And let me remind everyone that the American consumer: Lauren, that the grandparent, the child who needs these drugs  all of us as consumers are paying twice. We pay high drug prices, but we also, as taxpayers, pay for the National Institutes of Health, the research to fund pharmaceutical companies. So, the American consumer is really bearing this price on both ends. We are paying high prices, higher than anyone else in the world. And we are paying for the research. More research is done in the United States, federal investment, than elsewhere. And that's why, I think, this has become such a critical issue in this election and at a time when there is so much disagreement on so many issues. We are seeing Republicans and Democrats support strong action to reign in the price of pharmaceuticals. And the reason why is that pharmaceuticals aren't like any other issue. They're not like  it's not a normal market. Pharmaceuticals are  pharmaceutical companies are able to price  to basically charge a monopoly price and rely on numerous insurance companies who don't have that pricing power to just pay what they can charge. And that is why you're seeing this outrage around the country. You're seeing this outrage because there is only one Epipen. There is only one drug. And essentially, the pharmaceutical company is saying, I'm not going to charge you the value of this drug. I'm going to charge you whatever I can. And in a healthcare system, that's not right. In a system where people need these drugs to live, that's not right. So, we'll get into more solutions as we go this evening. But I'd just like to say  leave you with the words of one healthcare observer who recently said, Imagine if Jonas Salk would have priced the polio vaccine like today's drug companies. We'd still have polio. So, with that, I will turn it over to the other side."

    "data": "Thank you, John, and good evening. My role here tonight probably seems like a steep uphill climb. I think that for most people in the audience you probably feel the same way about the pharmaceutical company as you do about a pat down at the TSA. And not all of that skepticism is unwarranted. Some patients, particularly those with serious chronic illnesses, are paying too much out of pocket for their medicines, and we need to find a solution for that. So I'm not here to defend the industry or any part of the industry. What I am here to do is to defend the policies that keep Americans healthy and provide hope in the face of a devastating diagnosis. Lori is going to talk about how we can do that in a few minutes  about how we can balance innovation and access. But the important thing is to continue innovation and expand access, because if we go down the road that other nations have gone down and use price controls to control investment in innovation in the industry, make no mistake, we will have fewer medicines, people will suffer and die unnecessarily. And if we step back and take a look at the big picture, not the headlines of the moment, not last year's data, but decades of data and evidence, we'll see that medicines properly used are the things that keep us out of the most expensive parts of the healthcare system; that's hospital beds and nursing homes. After you hear Lori and I speak, you're going to join us in voting against the motion that we should blame big pharma for runaway healthcare costs because they are not the biggest costs we face. It's not the suffering from Alzheimer's or diabetes. It's not the prolonged disability and premature death that's being driven by medicines. That is what they are meant to cure. Zeke and Neera are going to be arguing that drug costs, not hospital costs, not nursing homes, not physician visits, are going to sink the economy unless we empower a committee of government regulators to step in and set prices and profits for medicines. If you think that the core problem with American healthcare today is that we don't have enough bureaucrats and committees, then I'd encourage you to accept their plan. If, on the other hand, you want innovation that moves at the pace of 21st century technology, I have an alternative for you that focuses on competition, innovation, and, of course, containing total healthcare costs. The problem with our debates around drugs is that the prices of drugs are very easy to see. They come with sticker prices. The benefits can be harder to see because they accrue over years and decades. Let me give you just three examples. From 1969 to 2013, mortality from cardiovascular disease declined by nearly 70 percent thanks to medicines that were highly effective for high cholesterol and high blood pressure. For HIV/AIDS, mortality has declined by 85 percent. And today, some patients can keep their disease in check with a single pill. Even a disease as complex as cancer, we've seen gains; 20 percent over the past 20 years, a reduction in mortality and with better treatments coming online every day. Remember, none of these developments were inevitable. If we had handled the prescription drug challenge the way many other countries do and the way our opponents tonight suggest, we would see fewer innovations, and we'd wait longer for them. Now, apply that analysis to the future and think about what it means. There are new technologies on the way that promise to do even more to lower medical costs and improve health. Gene therapies that can restore sight to blind children, stem cell therapies that can restore a working pancreas to a diabetic woman who no longer has to rely on insulin. Shouldn't we be doing everything possible to bring those technologies to patients as quickly and safely as possible? Let me close with a few basic facts about why you should vote against the motion tonight. First, government actuaries and independent analysts agree the total level of spending we're going to be devoting to medicines is going to stay level for the next decade, at about 16 percent of total spending. About 85 percent of that spending is coming from somewhere else. To put it another way, we're going to spend more on physicians and hospitals  a trillion dollars more, over the next decade. Second, it's essential to remember that effective prescription drugs can actually reduce other healthcare costs. So, the Alzheimer's association projects that if we had a treatment by 2025 that just delayed, not cured  just delayed Alzheimer's by five years, over the next decade, Medicare would save close to $350 billion, and patients would be saving more than $220 billion in outof pocket costs. So when we look at the total cost of care, how much is devoted to medicines, how much of the increase is somewhere else, we see a very different picture, because sometimes a drug that looks expensive is going to wind up being the cheapest option for treating that condition we have. And those expensive medicines don't stay expensive forever. Patents expire, prices plummet. Doctors, MRIs and hospital beds start expensive, and they stay expensive. If we're serious about slowing runaway healthcare costs, what we need to do is not focus on the sticker price of the drug but of the total price of delivering better health. We need business models that reward doctors and hospitals for delivering better care and reducing costs. The overarching principle is simply this: More experiments, more competition, and fewer attempts to micromanage innovation because we don't know  because a venture capitalist who has billions of dollars at stake doesn't know what the technology is that's going to be best positioned to improve our health a decade from now. So please join me in voting against the motion: Blame big pharma for runaway healthcare costs. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you very much. I do want to remind you that the topic here is: are drugs driving healthcare costs? It's not, do we want more research on drugs? Do we want cures of diseases that we can't control, like Alzheimer's? It's about drug pricing and driving healthcare costs. We agree with John Donvan. We agree with Paul, right? We all want drugs that are actually beneficial for us, have minimal side effects. But we don't want those drug prices of $150,000 per year to take those drugs. And how much you save on Alzheimer's all depends on how much they're going to charge for that drug, which, by the way, was not mentioned. So let me review a few points with you as to why in fact it is drug prices that are driving high healthcare costs. First, I want to remind you what Neera said about that drug Gleevec, which is a cancer drug, to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia, or CML. It's a great drug. It took a disease that was a chronic disease  but blasted off and killed people in six months and basically made people live a very long time with the disease. The drug was introduced in 2001, as Neera had said, at about $3,300 per month. It has gone up about 300 percent. No added research to the drug. No new innovation in the drug. The price just went up because the drug company had a captive audience and there was no cap in the United States. And let me point out, that drug is 71 percent cheaper in the next most expensive country, Switzerland, where that drug company sits at home and it's substantially cheaper in Germany, England, Canada than even that. There are multiple drugs out there on the market that are about $150,000 per year, don't cure anyone, ameliorate the disease, but are hugely expensive. For multiple sclerosis, the FDA recently approved Lemtrada, $150,000. It reduces multiple sclerosis flares from two and a half in every twoyear period to one point 75 in every twoyear period, does not cure one patient, $150,000 for that drug. There are plenty of drugs in cancer that are similar. No one in this room, well I'm not sure, this is New York. Many in this room may be able to afford that, but most Americans  where the median income is $56,000 a year, cannot afford those drugs. Do you know who pays for that extra money? You do, through your higher premiums and your taxes. Let me make a second point. Drug costs are going up faster than any other segment of the health care marketplace. Since 2008, six years  eight years, brand named drugs, those drugs that have the big sales name, right, have gone up in price 164 percent. Regular inflation in American society? 12 percent. In 2014, drug costs went up 13 percent, 2015, 8 percent. Compare that to the rest of the health care marketplace. Hospitals went up about 4, 4.5 percent. Doctor visits went up about 4.8 percent. Drug costs are going up much faster than the rest of the health care marketplace. And that's going to carry on into the future, because the most expensive part of drug costs are those specialty drugs and those specialty drugs are going up at 20 percent, and they're the ones drug companies are bringing to marketplace. Here's one quote, The cost of chemotherapy drugs for cancer is increasing at a rate significantly higher than other cost components of actively treated cancer patients driven largely by those specialty drugs, but chemotherapy drug increases have been offset by slower growth in other areas like cancer surgery. So, it's drug prices that are driving high costs in cancer. Third point. Drug companies claim that they need these high prices to pay for research. Remember, most of them spend less than 20 percent of their dollars on research. They spend more on marketing than they do on research at all. And drug companies are hugely profitable. The average profit in the drug industry is 15 percent, but Diliad, which had that new hepatitis drug, profit margin 55 percent. Biogen 33 percent. Even Behemoths like Pfizer are at 15 percent. And compare that to other industries. Cars. What's the profit margin of car makers? Six percent. Big oil. Big dangerous oil, 8 percent. The pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable industry in the United States. They could use with a little less profits, and still have plenty of incentive to do all that research. And we should compare drug profits  drug company profits, with the people who they're going to say are the bad guys. Insurance companies. None of us like insurance companies and I'm not here to defend a single one of them. But their profit margin is nowhere near drug company profit margins. Drug company profit margins, I mean, Aetna, 4 percent profit margin. Cigna, 5.5 percent profit margin. Humana 2.4 percent profit margin. Substantially less than 15 percent and substantially less than 55 percent. Let's conclude by noting that the United States government gives drug companies a monopoly through patents and FDA marketing exclusivity, and then we don't regulate their prices. We know what happens when you give a patent or marketing exclusivity and a monopoly to a company. It exploits the monopoly by just jacking up the prices, and that's what drug companies have done. Every other country in the world regulates the prices. We in the United States, we grant the monopoly and then we say, why are prices so high when we don't regulate them. So we have to actually control drug prices. Either the drug companies do it, or we do need the government to step in and actually control drug prices."

    "data": "Thank you. In the 1990s, HIVAIDS was feared not just because of the human toll it was taking on society. It was also feared because of the strong financial impact it was having on our healthcare system. But in the mid1990s, combination therapy treatments came to market. And since that time, HIVAIDS death rates have fallen by 86 percent in this country. Today, it's chronic disease and treating patients with chronic disease that are responsible for 90 percent of all healthcare costs. Just one of these  diabetes  is responsible for $245 billion in costs. We have medicines to treat patients with diabetes. We know how to treat them and we have guidelines that tell us how to treat them, but yet only one in three patients today is adequately treated for their diabetes. If we did more to get those patients treated and have them adherent to their medicines, we would save $19 billion in this country. But the real tsunami, in terms of healthcare costs, is coming in the nottoodistant future, when we can anticipate spending a trillion dollars to care for patients with Alzheimer's disease. If we do nothing to address those costs, they're coming. I don't know of any other way to address those costs, other than innovation. And the good news is that we're making strong progress in our science. Today, immunotherapy medicines that are hitting the market are using the body's own immune system to fight back against hardtotreat cancers. And we're seeing that progress already, with cancer death rates falling 23 percent just since 1991. When we talk about health care costs, though  and Zeke mentioned it  Hepatitis C is one that comes to mind. But what people don't often talk about is that before these new, innovative treatments hit the market, we were spending $30 billion a year in this country to treat patients with Hepatitis C, and those costs were projected to climb to $80 billion in 20 years. But again, innovation happened. New medicines hit the market that took a disease that killed five times as many people as HIVAIDS does in this country and cured it in eight to 12 weeks of time. And something else happened. In under a year, we had two additional Hepatitis C medicines that came to market, and the price of those medicines fell by 40 to 60 percent, in terms of what they cost before. From a clinical perspective, we've cured a million patients from Hepatitis C in twoanda half years. That's more than the previous 20 years combined. While it's clear that the launch of those medicines in 2014 caused prescription drug spending to grow, and we hit a high water mark of 12.5 percent in 2014, the government actuaries, though, predict over the next decade, spending for medicines will be in line with all other forms of healthcare spending costs. Why should we believe the actuaries? Well, let me explain. The system in our country works like this. When a brand name medicine gets approved, it can expect to get competition from another brand name medicine in under two years of time. And the example I just used, with Hepatitis C, that competition happened in less than a year. When that competition happened, prices fall. In addition, we have generic entry. And when generic entry happens, typically, 10 to 12 years after a product hits the market, 80 percent of costs drop for that product. Market share shifts overnight. Today, 90 percent of all medicines used in this country are generic. And we have something also very different. Neera mentioned in her opening that we have all of these different payers, and they don't have enough pull to get  to actually negotiate with our companies. Well, that's untrue. There are three large pharmacy benefit managers in this country that buy on behalf of 75 percent of all prescription drugs. And they use that leverage extensively to drive big discounts and big rebates from companies, to the tune of $115 billion last year. So, to say that there's not competition in our marketplace is factually incorrect. And the difference between medicines and all other forms of healthcare is that our costs do fall over time. We don't have generic hospitals or generic doctors. The cost of procedures, like an angioplasty, have gone up 66 percent, and there is no signs that it will ever fall. But the price of medicines does fall over time. I'm not going to sit here and argue, though, that solving the healthcare challenges that we face are somebody else's problem. We all share in trying to get to a better system, and we do believe that there are solutions that can be out there that will address some of the cost challenges we face. Paul mentioned the need to reform the FDA. Today, there are 4,000 drugs sitting at the Food and Drug Administration, generic drugs, waiting to get approval. The average time to get a generic drug approved at the FDA today is four years. That's too long. Getting generic medicines to the market sooner increases competition. We also need to ensure that the FDA can keep pace with the regulatory science and the new advances we're making so that they can review brand name drugs quicker and get those to market so that they compete with other brand name drugs. And we also need to address the challenges to moving towards a value based healthcare system. We embrace the movement towards moving towards a value based healthcare system, but we also need to recognize that today there are challenges that make it difficult to do so. The need for future innovation is clear. Drug costs, though, are not unsustainable. Disease and the costs associated with disease in this country is what is unsustainable. While the solutions that you're going to hear espoused by my opponents tonight attempt to glorify some of the systems that we see abroad, they typically fail to acknowledge the real consequences when governments seek to set prices, intervene in markets, and determine the value a given medicine has. Those decisions are best left to patients and providers. I urge you to vote against the motion tonight. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you, John. So, why does the Republican Party choose to nominate Donald Trump, a man who, as John Mulaney tells us, begins every day by asking himself, What would a cartoon rich person do? The key to understanding the Donald Trump phenomenon is to recognize that he is neither a disease nor a symptom. He is a beta test for a cure. Americans are turning to him because he represents the breakdown of the postCold War left/right politics of the nation, a breakdown that has been happening in slow motion for the past two decades, fueled by a dramatic decline of trust in America's elites. The percentage of Americans today with a great deal of trust in the presidency, the courts, the public schools, and the banks are in the teens. Trust for unions, the justice system, big business, Congress, and the media are in single digits. This decline didn't happen overnight. It began with Watergate and Vietnam, and continued through the financial crisis and the Iraq War. Real failures undermined confidence in the capacity of elite institutions to do good and in their capability to represent the interests of the people. Now, working and middle class Americans are re asserting themselves against the bipartisan political and cultural establishment, utterly discredited due to their record of failure. The list is familiar to you all by now: 9/11, Iraq, Katrina, Congressional corruption, financial meltdown, bank bailouts, failed stimulus, a healthcare mess, stagnant wages, rising distrust, diminished hopes. 16 years of bipartisan failures by Republicans and Democrats alike to live up to what the people wanted. This distrust was earned. Through it all the elites were looking out for the interest of people other than those they were elected to serve. It's no accident that Donald Trump broke with the Republican party's orthodoxies on the issues of immigration, trade, and foreign policy, because those are the bipartisan elite consensus views favored by the donor class, by big business, and by party leadership to the exclusion of others. Rather than responding to the populous tendencies that we all saw rising up from this electorate with real changes, the elites overpromised and underdelivered. They thought they could get by holding a musket over their head in election years and prioritizing what lobbyists want in all other years. They were comfortable in a bubble of economic success, a world away from the areas that never saw any recovery. Elite indifference to populous opinion and the economic pain many Americans continue to experience created a vacuum that Donald Trump was happy to fill. A number of smart commentators on the right and the left have delved into the question of America's lost greatness, and they've discovered what would lead voters to find Donald Trump's message so appealing. It's the same phenomenon identified by Chris Hayes on the left in Twilight of the Elites, and on the right by Charles Murray and Yuval Levin in Coming Apart and The Fractured Republic. It's a dramatic failure of the institutions run by America's elites and nostalgia for a time when such mediating institutions could be trusted. Imagine you are one of the millions of middleaged, unemployed, white Americans with a high school degree. There are today seven million men in prime working age who have dropped out of the labor force. That's 15 percent. That's higher than ever  than since the end of the Great Depression. There are millions more who know people personally experiencing this kind of pain as a brother, as an uncle, as a son. Moved from unemployment to disability, you will receive sufficient benefits to subsist, around $1,200 a month, which is enough to pay for the alcohol and the drugs that help you self medicate. Your life is essentially one marked by hopelessness, desperation and anxiety. You are statistically unlikely to ever reenter the workforce and alone among all demographics the likelihood of suicide is rising for you. The things that make life not only endurable but happy are religious faith now lost to you, family which is fractured, community which is disintegrated, and work which you find hard to come by. The TV screen flickers with images of people living lives you could never hope to emulate. Your situation is bleak and while our soma today is better it is still not a replacement for the pursuit of happiness. Your tomorrows look dark, but the past, even the grimy parts of it, look like gold. And when a goldenhaired man comes on TV, a man who represents a vision of what you might hope your life could be like, a man who is a traitor to his class, who defies the elites, who is rich and successful, who comes from the world of the elites but is strong enough to reject them and their lives and he tells you it's not your fault. It's not your fault that your life is the way it is. He tells you it's the fault of immigrants and bad trade deals and wasteful, pointless wars based on lies. He tells you the problem with the elites is not that they are too conservative or that they are too liberal, but that they are stupid and don't care about you. He tells you with confidence that he alone can make everything great again and you listen. In the absence of the failures of the elites, could Donald Trump succeed? The answer is no. Our elite leadership class sowed the wind and Donald Trump is the whirlwind they've reaped. Vote for the motion."

    "data": "I want to begin my opening remarks by asking you in the audience a few questions. First question. How many of you in this audience have been to Europe in the last five years? Raise your hand. Okay. Yes. All right. How many people in this audience live in Manhattan or let's just say New York City or a New York Citylike suburb like Westchester. Raise your hands. Okay. Thank you. Most hands go up. I didn't see the people up in the nosebleed seats. How many people in this audience have graduate degrees? Once again, I would say most hands went up, right? One more question. I'm very curious. Generally speaking, Sancerre is white or red wine? White. White seems to be the consensus. You are correct. Thank you very much. Why am I asking these questions? It's very simple. I hate to break it to you, but you are the elite. You live in the most expensive city in America. You travel voluntarily across the ocean to look at paintings you could find on Google. You drink wine that never costs less than $20 a bottle. You're the elite and so this proposition is very simple. Do you blame yourselves  for the rise of Donald Trump? Now, my friends on the opposite side would like to imagine the elite is someone else. All right? It's the billionaire class that you sometimes hear about. It's those corrupt politicians, Democrats or Republicans in Washington. It's some idea of an elite and yet it's you. And so here's the question that we have to confront tonight, and it's an important question and it's going to be a very telling question, I think, psychologically speaking. Do you indict yourselves tonight for the rise of Donald Trump? Are you yourself to blame for this immigrant bashing? For this American firsting? For this Putin mancrushing? For this womanhating? For this charity shortchanging? For this genitalia boasting? For this Chapter 11 indulging? For this Mussolini admiring disgrace of a Republican candidate for the presidency of the United States? That is the question. Now what you've just heard from Ben was an astonishingly condescending portrait of who the Trump voter is, and you're going to hear from my friend, Jennifer, about just who a little  a few more specifics about who that is, not the guy nodding off in a heroin induced coma because he's been thrown out of his job, okay? There are, I am sure, even in this highly elite audience that just cheered wildly when I offered a fairly precise description of this joke of a candidate, there are some  probably some Trump supporters in this audience. Let me ask those Trump supporters, don't raise your hands, because  I don't want to put you in jeopardy, okay? Did you recognize yourself in that caricature? Are you going to walk out of here and go to the bathroom and shoot up just after this? I don't think so. We live in a democracy and people think democracy is about freedom. It's not. It's about accountability. It's about we the people being responsible for the choices we make in our lives and at the voting booth. Who do you blame for the Trump phenomenon? Well, Bob Rosenkranz I think put it well. He blames, or one could blame, the Trump voter. One could blame the people who are responding to this message of intolerance, bigotry, and fake victimization. They're the ones who are primarily accountable. If you want to find another culprit, I would offer you the parade of demagogues who have emerged in the ether on certain cable news shows, on certain radio shows, some of them have first names that are like Sean, for example, or Rush, for example. I'm not mentioning last names. There are lots of Sean's and Rush's out there. And this is a pattern that in history we know very well. It is the pattern of the demagogue, demagoguing to a public or to a part of a public that wants easy answers and people to blame. They are accountable for those choices. Do not feel guilty for standing apart from them and do not condescend to them by saying that they have no moral agency, no personal agency in the disastrous political choice they may be about to make. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. And not to talk outside of school, but Jen Rubin did say onstage before this all began that any one of us would do better than Donald Trump on the debate stage, and I think that Bret Stephens just recently showed that his debating and sophistry skills far exceed Donald Trump. The argument  if we're going to take it seriously  is that this audience, which means my mom, a retired stayathome mom, and the almost out of work actor I met in the reception back there  that they are the elites, but that Sean Hannity is not. He's trying to exculpate Sean Hannity and  or trying to say Sean Hannity is to blame, and is not part of the elites, and this crowd is. I think we need to get more specific. I think we need to define who the elites are that we're talking about. And I'm happy to name very specific names. They are the men and women  mostly the men  who were in charge over the past decades, who led our country to the point it is now. They are George W. Bush. They are Mitt Romney. These are the people who were elected, nominated officials, put in charge of the public good. They're Mitch McConnell and John Boehner and their predecessors. And it's telling to talk about their predecessors  Tom Delay, who invited a lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, into not just the Republican Party, but in to make Washington D.C. be a favor factory for the well connected. Bill Frist, a Senate Majority Leader who now runs Frist Capital  that invests in healthcare companies. So, he lobbies for Obamacare that enriches the hospitals he's investing in, both driving up the prices and taking away the options for everybody else. Former Senator Majority Leader Bob Dole, also an Obamacare lobbyist living very well by lobbying to take away the  lobbying for drug companies that want to keep generics off the market. Eric Cantor supposedly representing Virginia's 7th District as a House Majority Leader, really representing Wall Street. Eric, are you here tonight? Because he retired to a job here. These men enrich themselves while supposedly in the public trust. Currently, five of the six richest counties in America are within commuting distance of the U.S. capital. That is not the sign of a healthy republic. That is a sign of insiders who rigged a game in their favor. So, they are extracting wealth from the rest of the society. This is the Hunger Games, ladies and gentlemen. Again, five of the six richest counties in America are within commuting distance. And that's why you got a Tea Party. That's why 2009, 2010  this wasn't a proRepublican uprising, simply, or, you know, a fixthedebt uprising, simply. It was a populist uprising. It was anger at bailouts. It was anger at a stimulus that was just handouts to the Chamber of Commerce. It was anger at an Obamacare that was just handouts to the drug companies and the hospitals. And Republican leaders, these elites, the men and women in power, gave lip service. Democratic leaders did too. And then, what did they do? They squelched that populist uprising. In public, they would say, Yes, we need to get rid of crony capitalism,' and then they would go behind closed doors with the crony capitalist donors and say, Well, yes, that bottom 47 percent, well, they just won't take responsibility for their lives. That was Mitt Romney's description. If you were in the bottom 47 percent, it is literally your fault, and you don't belong in the Republican Party. You may not join our country club. That was the message from the Republican elites. And after they lost, they issued an autopsy, as they called it. Item number one was, Well, we need more lowskilled immigrants in. A laserguided program aimed at lowering the wages of the lowskilled. So, populism rose. The party elites tried to quelch it. They rigged the system. They enriched themselves. That's a systematic problem Ben and I have laid out. That's the system that they rigged. But I want to conclude with a very specific way, immediate way, in which the elites bear the blame. On that stage last year was Jeb Bush, backed by $100 million of donor money. He was the man in the arena. He was literally the man on the stage, and he failed to rise to the occasion. He was the one who could have beaten Donald Trump. Whom do we blame for Donald Trump being the nominee? The people who could have beaten him. Jeb Bush was number one. Chris Christie, probably the pick of a lot of you here, he disappointed me as well. He didn't rise to the occasion. He thought more important than attacking Donald Trump was attacking Marco Rubio. And then, when Christie lost, he scampered over to become the valet for Donald Trump. There's that saying of No man is  no matter how great  is thought great by his valet. I think the only exception is Trump and Christie. The backup of the elites was Marco Rubio. And he couldn't rise to the occasion either. He proved unable to move beyond his canned lines. And so  and what did most of the elites do when it boiled down, when they had an alternative, when they had Ted Cruz, who may not be the favorite of here  but is somebody other than Donald Trump. And remember, the question on the table is Whom do we blame for Donald Trump? Well, we know what Christie did. House Speaker John Boehner in the spring, during the debate, called Ted Cruz Lucifer in the flesh, literally. And he called Donald Trump his buddy. Bob Dole, the majority leader turned lobbyist, said of Trump, He's got the right personality. He's kind of a dealmaker. You had mayorturned presidential candidate turnedlobbyist Rudy Giuliani  said, if it came down to Trump or Cruz, quote, There is no question I'd vote for Trump. Majority leaderturned lobbyist Trent Lott told a reporter that he'd take Trump over Cruz if he had to choose. And then, of course, there was Hillary. She's the nominee. Any normal, decent candidate would be mopping the floor with this thricemarried, philandering, conman, liberal candidate trying to run as a Republican. She can't do it. Why not? Because she chooses opacity at all occasions, that the deplorable public doesn't deserve to know her business. These are the elites. These were the people who set the stage for Trump. These were the people who could have beaten Trump, who could have made him run away. They all failed. It's clear that we need to blame the elites for the Trump Phenomenon."

    "data": "Like Donald Trump himself, our distinguished opponents suffer from a lack of factual support for their motion. They paint a picture not unlike Donald Trump does  of a dystopia of heroin addicts, of despair, of poverty, of people sold short. Now, none of us should minimize the suffering, the social and economic dislocation that occurred in the wake of the 2008 crash. But let's get real here. Let's not play in Donald Trump's made up America. Just today, it comes out that 2015, we had record income growth in America. 5.2 percent. It comes out that that poverty is on the decline. It comes out that homeownership is rising. And this wasteland of manufacturing  that doesn't exist either. In fact, we've picked up about 900,000 manufacturing jobs in recent years. And we have a record high number of open manufacturing jobs. So, if any of your children would like to forego an expensive elite college and instead become workers in manufacturing firms, I would strongly encourage them to do so. It's bizarre, frankly, that we should concoct an economic argument that not only does not exist, but that is contrary to just about every conservative economic principles. Conservatives, you see, do not believe that immigration causes unemployment. That's a zerosum thinking that we usually attribute to our friends on the left. It's factually not true, and philosophically, it's abhorrent to conservatives who do not believe that if I win, you lose. Conservatives do not believe that millions of jobs were lost because of free trade. That's nonsense. We know that there has been a shuffling of the workforce. We know that more automized, more sophisticated workplace requires different skills, but we have not lost millions and millions of jobs to Mexico. China did not steal our jobs. This is the sort of economic fallacy that Donald Trump peddles. It's also a little bit bizarre, as my esteemed colleagues were talking, to think that Bob Dole, who's about as elitist as possible, could support Donald Trump. I thought he was a populist, and suddenly you have someone who is not a populist who is one of these elites who failed responsible for Donald Trump? That seems peculiar. It also seems frightfully unfair to blame the losers of 2016, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio. They may have not been the most competent politicians, but they offered an optimistic message of growth, of an American century, of a confident America in the world. And to blame them for Donald Trump seems awfully scurrilous When I think of the causes of Donald Trump, and we'll have plenty of time to discuss this later on, in addition to the voters themselves, I think how is it that so many people got these wrong ideas about the economy? I don't mean politically incorrect ideas, I mean wrong, factually wrong. Where could they have heard this? Where could they have gotten the notion that America doesn't win anymore? Where could they have gotten the notion that immigrants are to blame? Where could they have gotten the notion that trade steals our jobs? Ah, those were the folks that Bret Stephens mentioned. This is, and there really is one, a vast rightwing conspiracy. This is the toxic brew of rightwing media, rightwing politicians, charlatans out to make a buck, and for years they have dumped this dribble into the laps of voters who, as Bret says, it would be nice to blame immigrants. It would be nice to blame foreigners. But where do we get these wrongheaded ideas? It's the Sean's, the Rush's, and many others who have told you a story not unlike the ones our opponents did, which has no bearing in reality. Now if Donald Trump were really the result of an economic down boom or economic collapse, you'd think that they'd be poor, right? You know what the average salary, the average income of a Trump voter is? $72,000. These are not people down on their luck. These are people looking to blame others. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. The motion is an interesting way to frame it. And as a matter of fact, it's on the webpage. It says this is a bold initiative to reduce CO2  or is it unconstitutional? You know, there's a lot of emotion on this issue, about climate change. There's personal feelings  what's right, what's wrong. And there's certainly no shortage of politics behind all of this. But what about the science? Everybody talks about wanting to embrace the science, wanting to trust the soundness of the science. Well, for the next 90 minutes, Mike and I would hope to provide to you an exploration of that science and the realities, to look at what the Clean Power Plan is and what it isn't  and to pursue solutions that are going to be globally impactful. You know, the EPA has gone overboard. It's gone in the wrong direction, and it's provided us a false sense of accomplishment, in terms of environmental protection. So, let me be clear. The science says the climate is changing, and it is. CO2 is a forcing function. It is. We have a responsibility to mitigate CO2. We do. I'm no denier. But neither Mike or I represent any political party, or any industrial consortia per se. Hey, I was in the Obama Administration. I was pursuing what was important for energy sustainability for our national strategy  an alloftheabove strategy. But let me also be clear  the Clean Power Plan is not environmental legislation. It's not environmentallybased policy. The science doesn't support it. And why? If you take a look at the Clean Power Plan, 0.2 percent reduction of global CO2 emissions. 0.2 percent. The impact of global warming. 0.01 degree Fahrenheit. And the impact of sea level rise, the thickness of a dime. And by 2025, the total impact of this plan will be offset by three weeks of Chinese emissions. So, to me, it's scientifically underwhelming. But it's been called the cornerstone of our climate policy here in the United States and our leadership to the rest of the world. Even the EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy, who's testified before committees, same ones I have, has said as much. Don't judge the merits of this on CO2 reduction, judge it on our leadership. And I say that's naïve. It's not informed and we're breaking our arms patting ourselves on the back. But what's troubling is we're missing opportunities for potential environmental progress. We're not gaining, but we certainly are absorbing pain for higher costs of electricity in our country and negative impact or reliability, and we're treading on the responsibilities of FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) and PUCs (public utility commissions) across our country. Mike's going to talk about that in his portion of our opening statement, but I'll tell you what bothers me the most is we're missing opportunities. We're missing opportunities to advance science, to create pathways to transformative technology that are going to be real global solutions. That's global leadership, not environmental regulations that are not going to be globally transferrable. Environmental regulations and law works. We did it in the '70s with clean coal plants and transformed our coal fleet. We did it in the '90s by taking tailpipe emissions out of all automobiles with catalytic converters and hydrotreating. But we got to provide real pathways for that to happen. It's real public private partnerships. It's technology commercialization and readiness and a pathway to do that. It's a commitment to interagency collaboration in our federal government working together with industry to not simply ramrod policy down the states’ throats. You know our president says it the best: Hard things are hard. And he also says you got to think global but you have to act locally, and this plan doesn't do that. The global facts are we're going to have two billion more people on this earth by 2050, 90 percent of them in underdeveloped countries and they're all going to be using the vast majority of fossil fuels. As a matter of fact, 75 percent of our energy will be fossil fuel. The plan doesn't accept and appreciate those facts. It also assumes in our country that we're going to have available gas, affordable gas. It forces wind into our system and it doesn't consider reliability. It's not a global recipe. But what about technology? You know there's a thousand plants globally running on coal and the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has identified CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage) as the most important technology globally to affect climate change. Carbon capture utilization and storage. It's not something the EPA can simply declare ready  because it's not. It's still being deployed in demonstration facilities. The EPA calls it ready and insists that it be installed, and it's not ready. The plan's not environmentally  environmental law at its best. It's not globally acceptable. It's never too late for a good decision. Not this plan. Turn away from this pathway, go to a roadmap for global deployment and embrace real leadership. That's technology, not ideology, and that's why you should vote for the motion."

    "data": "Thank you very much. I want to start out simply by saying that these rules, which are being proposed by the Obama administration are not enough. I would agree with my esteemed opponent on that topic. I wish EPA would go further. I wish we had a more ambitious rule. I think we could implement a more ambitious rule and it wouldn’t cost anymore, but these rules as they stand are extraordinarily important. Once implemented, they will reduce CO2 emissions from the U.S. utility sector by 870 million tons a year. That is more than the total annual emissions from Germany, Iran, Korea, or Brazil. This one rule is more important in terms of climate impact than all of the emissions from any one of those countries. This one rule has said to the rest of the world, The United States is serious. We are a real partner. This rule was critical, and I can say this because I was part of the conversations, in getting the government of India to agree to come to the table at the Paris COP (Conference of the Parties) and join the world in combatting climate change. And India has now just cancelled a huge portion of its planned coal bill. China actually is reducing its emissions 10 years earlier than it said it would. So the world is moving, and the American willingness to retire our outmoded and noncompetitive coal fleet, which is what this rule represents, was a very, very important part of that progress. This is not small potatoes. It's also not a silver bullet. This is not the kind of problem that any one regulation, any one country, any one sector can solve. But it's a big step forward. And fortunately it's a step that's going to demonstrate to the world that moving away from outmoded coal plants and on to cleaner technologies, gas efficiency, wind, and solar is not only good for the climate, it's economically attractive, because the reality is that  if you look at the latest studies  there's one that was done in Colorado by a bunch of renewable energy experts which calculated that if the United States built the lowest cost electricity system that we can imagine with today's technology, nothing magic, we would be able to reduce our CO2 emissions by 80 percent by 2030 at no net increase in utility bills for customers. This morning PJM, which operates the most coal heavy graded in the United States, it includes most of the coal belts, states like Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, they said that their grid  these are the people who operate the grid, these are the people left to answer the utilities, these are the people who keep the lights on  they said that the Clean Power Plan can be implemented with no loss of reliability, and their best guess was a 1 to 3 percent increase in energy prices. Now, why is this possible? Very simply, five years ago we had three  523 coal plants generating 50 percent of our electricity but also emitting the largest quantity of sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, and carbon. Every year 13,000 Americans were estimated to be dying from those coal plants which were old, 70 percent of them were more than 30 years old, and those old plants were outmoded. Very few had modern scrubbers. Why were they so dirty? Because in 1977, when Congress passed the Clean Air Act, the utilities promised. You don't need to regulate these plants. We're just going to retire them. They're going to be gone. You don't need to do anything about them. But they didn't keep that promise. They operated them dirty for 40 more years. And it took an oilman from Texas, George Bush, who was the first person who actually proposed that we ought to tackle all of these pollutants together, Bush promised he would clean up from these power plants mercury, nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon. And when he became president, the coal industry unfortunately  well, let's put it  they put enough pressure on him that he didn't follow up on his promise. President Obama is now following up on the promise. And the war on coal you've heard so much about is really more or less Barack Obama carrying out one of George Bush's unfulfilled campaign promises. It was not a wild leftwing idea nor is it regulatory overreach. The Supreme Court ordered EPA to regulate carbon if it found that carbon caused climate change. EPA looked to the scientists who said, It does. And our opponents agree, carbon causes climate change, climate change is dangerous, the Clean Air Act requires that it be cleaned up, but this plan is working. Right now 238 of the coal plants have already retired. We're almost half of the way to the goal set by the Clean Power Plan, and you will notice your lights are still on. Reliability has not been degraded. In fact, the wholesale price of electricity over the past five years has fallen by 25 percent while we are replacing coal with cleaner modern competitive alternatives. The sky is not falling. It is getting cleaner, and that's the reason you should vote against this motion."

    "data": "Well, thank you and good evening. I'm going to focus my introductory remarks on the legal aspects of how EPA has gone overboard. Now, don't worry. In a sixminute introduction, we're not going to be able to take a whirlwind tour through the thousands of pages of briefing that's pending before the D.C. Circuit. Instead, what I'm going to do is focus and narrow my conversation to two fundamental legal defects that relate directly to what the Secretary referenced. And first, let me just set the stage about what we're talking about here  the Clean Power Plan, the 111(d) Rule, as they refer. What EPA has done is they have passed a so  you know, a gas mileage requirement of sorts for existing coal and gasfired power plants. And they have set that standard at a level that is more stringent than the standard that they have simultaneously passed for brand new state of the art plants. Let that sink in. That's like you being told by EPA that the car you already own is subject to a gas mileage standard that they recognize you can't meet and that is actually more stringent than what is being promulgated for a brand new car. So, let's talk about the fundamental disconnect there of an existing standard more stringent than a new standard. And how did they get there? Well, that leads you to the first fundamental legal problem. It's called the outside the fence issue. And what we have here is EPA not relying upon the definitions it has used and have been interpreted under the portion of the Clean Air Act that they have used. Okay? And they have instead expanded  massively expanded  the definition of a phrase best system of emission reduction, which is contained within another phrase, Standard of performance. And for nearly half a century of Clean Air Act jurisprudence, over Republican and Democratic administrations, that standardsetting practice under Section 111 has involved the assessment of technology and processes that can be applied inside the fence of individual sources. It has not included this reimagining and expansive definition that EPA has given, which says you can go outside the fence of a facility, and you can make assumptions about what they might be able to do by interacting in a market or by paying somebody else to generate in their place. These outsidethefence assumptions include things like generation shifting, the idea of instead of dispatching electricity with your own power plant, you can pay somebody else to dispatch in your place  like renewable energy. And renewable energy, by the way, isn't even governed by the rule. So, EPA has argued   and I'm sure you'll hear tonight  that there's precedent for this. They've done this before. But let me be clear. This section of the Clean Air Act has never been used for this purpose. In over 100 separate performance standards that have been promulgated, this type of definition, this outside the fence approach has not been allowed. Has not been done and has not been allowed. In fact, the precedent that they will direct you to  and EPA has relied upon  involve explicit statutory direction, contemplating that you would have outside the fence type factors. That does not exist in this part of the Clean Air Act. It's not enough to say the Clean Air Act  that they've done it before. This part of the Clean Air Act has never been used that way. And the authority matters. This is exactly the type of overreach that the Supreme Court was warning against in its 2014 decision of Utility Air Regulatory Group or UARG. Let me read from the majority opinion a phrase that I think you're going to hear a lot about in the disposition of what  whether this rule is legal. When an agency claims to discover in a long extant statute an unheralded power to regulate a significant portion of the American economy, we typically greet its announcement with a measure of skepticism. We expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency, decisions of vast economical  economic and political significance. So, did EPA heed the warning? Well, we know we have a long extant statue. Section 111 of the Clean Air Act that over 50 years has not been taken outside the fence and we know that in states that mine coal, produce coal, manufacture things, rely upon it for their electricity, this rule will have vast economic and political implications. So did Congress speak clearly in the Clean Air Act in the section that the EPA is relying upon? And the frank answer is no. In fact, the terms that are contained in Section 111 and the manner in which the D.C. Circuit has interpreted those words contradict the EPAs position. So they're really asking for an expansive definition that's never been done before. When the Supreme Court has actually set a standard that proves that they actually have to have an explicit direction. So, the rule will fail on that ground, but let's shift to another legal problem that maybe goes to some of the more fundamental issues that we'll debate throughout the night, and that is that this rule is not enforceable by EPA because the assumptions it made, these outside the fence assumptions about how the grid will operate, they are not things the EPA has the power to make happen. When it sets a standard, it must be able to enforce the assumptions that are built into it. And so you have a line of jurisprudence and a statute called the Federal Power Act, and in that area of the law, it has been held consistently that intrastate electric power systems are the purview of the state. And so I'll wrap up by saying this, that EPA can't just say states have flexibility. EPA has to be able to prove they can enforce the assumptions they built into the rules. I'm going to borrow from the metaphor that Professor Freeman's colleague, Lawrence Tribe has said. If a robber approaches you and says your money or your life, it doesn't make that action legal because he says you can pay with cash, credit, or bitcoin."

    "data": "Good evening. Good evening. There are four reasons you should vote no against this proposition. First, the benefits of this policy vastly outweigh the costs. It's very simple. We can concede for the moment for sake of argument, that it might cost something to transition to a cleaner energy economy. We'll spend some time in our dialogue  Okay. As you know I'm recounting the four reasons you should vote against the proposition and the first is simply that the benefits of it  of the policy outweigh the costs and, again, we will have an opportunity through the discussion to challenge some of the claims the other side is making about skyrocketing electricity costs and reliability, which we believe we can very clearly dispute. But for the moment concede the idea that it might cost something to transition to cleaner energy and the question for you is whether it's worth it. The projection for this rule is that by 2030 the benefits will be around between $30 and $50 billion and the cost  and that's annual, and the cost $5 to $8 billion. So you can see there this gap, the clear gap between benefits and cost and that gap will shrink. In other words, it will be more costly to deal with this problem of climate change the longer we wait. For that you don't have to believe EPA, you don't have to believe us, Carl and me, you don't have to believe the environmentalists, because economists on both sides of the aisle and, in fact, former officials from Republican administrations like Hank Paulson, the treasury secretary in the George W. Bush administration, have said very clearly that it's economically risky to wait to deal with this problem, that it gets only more expensive as time goes by. So the first reason to vote against the proposition is simply that the benefits overwhelm the costs of doing so. Second reason you should vote against it, Carl made in his discussion of the policy implications of the rule, that is that it matters. It's a meaningful policy as it will actually help us make progress, contrary to the other side's claim, as Chuck said, that this makes no difference, that it's meaningless and insignificant and, therefore, illegitimate and shouldn't be pursued. It's just not the case. In fact, power plants in this country produce a disproportionate share of carbon pollution, up to 30 percent of the economy's pollution as measured in 2013. And according to the Nonpartisan International Energy Agency, that's 6 percent of global emissions. That on its own makes it significant. But what's really careless about that argument is that it amounts to saying that we shouldn't do anything about anything because we can't do everything all at once. That just can't be right. You have to be able to make progress on a problem like this, a global problem, incrementally and cumulatively. And what's required, as Carl said, is that all the major economies of the world make commitments just like this one, to cut emissions from the sectors of their economy that produce the most emissions. The third reason you should vote against the proposition is that it combines smart regulation with technology innovation. The other side's presentation, and Chuck made this point, is resting on the idea that you should choose between technology like carbon capture and sequestration and regulation, on the other hand, and that you choose against regulation because they imply, It doesn't work. But, in fact, the best combination is the two of them. So historically what's happened when we produce smart regulation that motivates or incentivizes technology, we get tremendous gains. The catalytic converter Chuck mentioned, it was invented in 1950 but it wasn't widely deployed and it didn't appear in its modern cost effective form until Clean Air Act regulation required the auto industry to reduce emissions from the tailpipes of cars and trucks. That gave wind to the sales of the catalytic converter. The same is true of the Clean Power Plan. What it does is incentivize technology, clean energy, wind energy, solar energy, and sets the course of the future and says, This is the direction we're going in, in this sector. You can invest in those technologies. And it will stimulate carbon capture and sequestration just the way it stimulated catalytic converters. Just to be clear tonight, Carl and I are not antitechnology and we're certainly not anticarbon capture and sequestration. We just think the two work well together. The fourth reason is really what I'll spend the bulk of my time on, even though I'll run out here in the opener. In discussion it's the legal argument that Mike made. And very briefly let me say this, while I deeply respect my colleague, Larry Tribe, who said that this policy is akin to lighting the Constitution on fire, with all respect it is absolutely not the case. There is no commandeering of the states or interference with their sovereignty or guns to the head as Mike colorfully invoked because the states have a complete optout from this policy. The states can say, No, not going to plan. The federal government  you can be left to develop and enforce these standards on your own. That deal, that bargain, that the federal government sets pollution standards and the states are given the opportunity to devise plans to implement them the way they see fit in their jurisdictions is at the heart of pollution laws passed beginning in the 1970s, and for 50 years the Supreme Court has upheld that scheme as perfectly constitutional and in no way commandeering or interfering with the states. There is no violation. Second, there is no taking of private property, which you sometimes hear opponents say. Mike didn't mention it, but I was thinking he might, and if we get there I'll make that argument to you, too, simply because industry doesn't have a constitutional right that is absolute in perpetuity to continue to harm the public health just because they always have on the claim that it's their property. The Supreme Court in 200 years has never held that to be the case. There is no taking of private property. And, finally, and I'll take my extension from you if you're willing to grant it and, finally, the argument that EPA is somehow veering out of its lane here and doing energy policy and creating an unprecedented scheme beyond, as Mike said, the sense line, a discussion we'll get into in the dialogue, the EPA has taken a flexible law which Congress passed in 1970 and has amended subsequently, giving it broad discretion to set standards using the best system. And it has done that in a creative, in a costeffective, and in a flexible way that gives the states many, many opportunities to meet the standard. For that reason, because it's a costeffective, flexible, reasonable application of this law within its discretion, and because the benefits vastly outweigh the costs, you should vote no against the proposition."

    "data": "The biggest problems that we're facing right now has to do with our president trying to bring more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all. Those aren't my words, though. Those are the words of thencandidate Barack Obama in 2008. He pledged, That's what I intend to reverse when I'm President of the United States of America. Well, has he? My colleague and I agree that Obama was right, President Bush did, in many ways, usurp the power of Congress as president. Unfortunately, President Obama continued in his footsteps, and his  their successors show many signs of going in the same direction of trying to aggrandize presidential power. We believe tonight that our position actually the easy one to prove. Perhaps you agree with us that when any branch of the government transgresses the Constitutional bounds set before it, that it puts the foundations of our liberty at risk. But maybe you think Congress has  already has too much power under the Constitution, and the president actually should have some more flexibility and freedom of action. Maybe you think that achieving his goals might be worth breaking a few rules now and then. But if you acknowledge that he has taken actions, whether you think they're good or bad, that the institution actually assigns to Congress and not the president, then you must vote Yes on tonight's proposition, the president has usurped the powers of Congress. To usurp means to take power that doesn't belong to you. So under the Constitution, what powers do belong to the president? The president has the power to execute the law, but he cannot make law. He can't amend law, and he cannot repeal the law. Only the Congress has power to do that. He cannot spend money without congressional appropriation, and he cannot start a war. That's for Congress. He also can't make major appointments without confirmation by the Senate, and he can't sign a treaty without a twothirds vote of the Senate. Unfortunately, many presidents have overreached these areas. We certainly don't say President Obama's the first one to do so, and unfortunately, he will not be the last. But because tonight's problem is really referring to the current president, we are going to have to talk about him in some specifics. So we're going to divide up where my  my friend here, Michael, will focus on the international agreement  arena. He's going to talk about immigration, national security, war, and treaties. I'll focus on the domestic side, on the president's appointment power, his expenditure of money not appropriated by Congress, and his unilateral rewriting of some laws. I'm going to start with what I think is the most openandshut case, and that is an appointment. As I said, highlevel appointments need to have confirmation by the Senate. But there is an exception during recesses. The Senate  the president may make recess appointments. But not any old recess will do. Super short recesses like, you know, we're taking a break for lunch, the president can't just throw in a bunch of nominees and call it good. And out of the thousands of recess appointments through the history of this country, none of them has been made in the way that President Obama did. In December 2011, the Senate knew he wanted to push through some controversial nominees that they weren't going to confirm, so they purposely did not go into a big break over Christmas break as they normally do on December 17th. They said, we're going into sessions every three days purposely and explicitly to block the president's recess appointment power. But the president said, It doesn't matter. I'm going to do it anyway. He tried  he put four nominees on and said he was recess appointing them when the Senate said it wasn't in recess. His excuse was, I refuse to take no for an answer. That's hardly Constitutional reasoning. And unfortunately for him, No is exactly what the Supreme Court said. They said that unanimously. Every single justice, the conservatives, the liberals, the justices the president himself had put on the court agreed that he had usurped the powers in Congress. I hope you will agree as well. Another example of abuse comes up in the context of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. On 43 different occasions now, this administration has rewritten or ignored deadlines, fines, taxes, and other provisions of the statute because they wanted to ignore or postpone some of the politically painful parts of the law. People like the good stuff, but they don't want to have to pay for it, right? But the only reason the administration has gotten away with this so far because the court says the House of Representatives doesn't have standing to bring this argument. So basically, they've gotten off on a technicality so far. A final egregious example has to do with this administration's bailout of insurance companies that if you're suffering huge losses under Obamacare, and the administration asks Congress for an appropriation to help pay them back for some of the money they've been required by that law to pay out, and Congress explicitly refused to do that. But the administration brazenly decided to spend $7 billion of your taxpayers money on that anyway. When a DC circuit court heard the case, they just recently came down with a decision that said that the administration had blatantly violated the appropriations power. The Constitution could not be clearer on this. No money may be drawn from the treasury. But in consequence, appropriations made by law, period. And it turns out, as the New York Times just uncovered, that the legal team from the IRS had already told the president he didn't have authority to do this. That is brazenly usurping the power of Congress. You're going to hear about a lot of different cases and laws tonight, but don't forget that behind the discussion there is a vital principle, and that's that the structure of our Constitution is what preserves our liberty. It's what gives us a country where we have the prosperity, the civil society that our framework intended. That structural Constitution is worth fighting for. If, after listening to our debate, you agree that on any one of these areas that Michael and I will talk about tonight, the president has usurped powers that the Constitution gives to Congress, you should vote Yes on the proposition tonight. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. Eric and I, we're here this evening to ask for your vote against the proposition that the president has usurped Congress' Constitutional power. And we're going to talk about a lot of different specific issues over the course of the next hour. But in the opening, I'll talk mostly about domestic issues and Eric will talk mostly about foreign affairs issues. I guess I want to start where Carrie left off, with the importance of Constitutional structure because I think there's a point about which we all agree, certainly everyone on the stage and probably all of you in the audience, which is that the president is in fact a very important policy maker in modern government. That's not really what the question is tonight. The question is how we evaluate the power that the president wields. And that the motion on the table suggests that the president holds the power he holds because he's stolen it, unconstitutionally from Congress, right, in a power grab. A usurper is someone who seizes force, as Carrie noted, illegally, often  often by force through seizing power. And the question tonight is why the president has the power he possesses. Now, the reality is that the president possesses power today not because he seized it by force, but instead because over the course of the 20th century, Congress has lawfully delegated to the president power to solve important and complicated social problems. Over the course of the 20th century, people began to demand more from their governments. We went through a nationalization and a globalization of our economy. We went through a Great Depression, a new deal, a couple of world wars, a civil rights revolution, and people demanded that the national government solve more and more complicated problems. Congress quickly realized that it couldn't solve all those problems on its own. It didn't have the capacity or the expertise to decide, say, what the right level of sulphur dioxide emission was for trucks on US highways, or what the right way was to regulate Wall Street derivatives, to make sure that we don't have another financial calamity. And so, in statute after statute, Congress delegated power to the executive branch, to administrative agencies, and to the president, to come up with solutions to these problems. Now, over the course of the 20th century, that did amount to a kind of Constitutional revolution, and it's made the president an important policy maker. And it does mean that the system we have today is really not the system that our founders imagined, and probably would have been one that they wouldn't have liked. But the system they imagined, the system that worked for our agrarian economy in the 19th century isn't sufficient to tackle the problems we have today. Now, let me get me concrete. Let me talk about a couple of issue areas. So one of the most prominent arenas in which the president's been criticized is immigration policy. But the most important fact that I can tell you guys tonight about immigration policy is this: There are 22 million noncitizens who live in the country. 11 million of them are out of status. They're unauthorized. They're not here lawfully. That means half of the legal subjects who are regulated by immigration law are in violation of the law. That means that Congress asked the president essentially to do the impossible. To enforce the law fully, the president would have to deport 11 million people. But this president, President Obama, while he's deported more every year than any preceding president, has still managed to deport just 400,000 each year. That's a large number, but it's only 3 percent of the unauthorized population. That means inevitably the president has to pick and choose, has to decide where enforcement resources will be prioritized and where they'll be deprioritized. And so the  the signature immigration initiatives that President Obama announced, the decision not to prioritize the removal of socalled dreamers, right, immigrants who arrived as children, or the parents of US citizens, that was just a way of bringing transparency and equality to a set of decision that's the president wasn't just empowered to make by Congress but was in fact obligated to make in order to enforce the law. Now, that doesn't mean that presidents have unlimited power because, of course, what Congress gives, Congress can take away. And Congress sets up the framework within which the president must operate. Also it means that inevitably there will be disagreements about what those framework rules mean. All of us who have kids know that whenever there are rules there are disagreements about what those rules mean. And sometimes the president's interpretation of those rules succeeds in the court. So with the Affordable Care Act, for example, one of the most high profile debates, one of the most high profile debates was about whether tax credits could be given to people who purchased health insurance on the federal exchanges instead of the state exchanges. The law was maybe confused on this point. There was striking disagreement among lawyers. But the Supreme Court sided with the president. But even when the president doesn't win at the court, even those losses, when a judge decides that the administration's interpretation of those rules that Congress sets to guide the president's exercise of power don't permit something that the administration has done, that's not a sign of usurpation, as Carrie suggested, it's actually a sign of legal compliance of courts because it's just more evidence that the president is, in fact, bound by these legal rules that Congress establishes. And for that reason Eric and I urge you to vote against the motion."

    "data": "Thank you, John. In preparation for this debate, I read Eric Posner's very interesting book on presidential power. And now I've heard Adam Cox. They seem to be coming at us from opposite directions. Adam Cox thinks everything the president has done is totally legal, authorized by broad delegations by Congress. In contrast, Eric Posner thinks that the very idea that the executives should be limited by laws is now, quote, obsolete. In this book he identifies what he calls, multiple examples, in which the executive I'm quoting now  the executive proceeded with dubious legal authority or simply ignored the laws and got away with it. In fact, he thinks the executive is now unbound by law. That's the title of his book, The Executive Unbound. Now, Carrie and I agree with Eric Posner that the executive has frequently acted without legal authority. That in itself demands an affirmative vote on tonight's resolution. The framers of our Constitution knew the dangers of an executive unbound and attempted to protect us, their posterity, through a written constitution limiting that executive's powers. Unfortunately, recent presidents and especially Bush and Obama have systematically breached those limits. Let me get down to some specifics, beginning with immigration. Now, as Adam Cox just explained, President Obama recently issued an order unilaterally giving  he didn't mention this, though  giving lawful status to some four million of those aliens who are here in violation of the law. Now, that doesn't mean not deporting them. That isn't just not prioritizing someone else. The actual terms of the order was to give them lawful status which includes the right to work, to sign up for Social Security, and to receive numerous other benefits. Now, obviously, Adam thinks this is good public policy. And he may very well be right about that. But it's hard to take seriously the idea that this is just routine enforcement discretion. For one thing, President Obama himself said just the opposite repeatedly when advocates were asking him to issue such an order. For example, on March 28, 2011, President Obama said, and I quote, With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportation through executive order, that's just not the case because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed. For me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president. Well, appropriate or not, Obama did it anyway. But here's what's interesting. Even after he signed the order, Obama did not claim he was just exercising discretion under the law or prioritizing. He candidly stated, and again I quote, What you're not paying attention to is I just took an action to change the law. Well, if you were paying attention when Carrie listed the various powers of the Constitution vests in Congress and not in the president, that was one of them. He cannot change the law. Only Congress can do that. But what matters about this is that if Obama can change this law, a future president can use socalled enforcement discretion to dispense with laws he or she doesn't like of any note  of any sort. Tax laws, or trade laws, or laws about ethics in government. Eric Posner just wrote in the New York Times a few days ago Donald Trump as president could refuse to enforce environmental regulations  and I'm quoting Eric here – just as Mr. Obama refused to enforce immigration laws. National security. Now, I don't think we have much disagreement up here that Presidents Bush and Obama both have usurped power in the national security arena. I just quote Eric Posner from his book. I love this book. And Donald Trump will love it even more. It'll be huge. Quote, The Obama Administration has followed Bush Administration policies on national security with the single exception of torture, including the reliance on broad surveillance powers, detention, military commissions, rendition, and targeted assassinations. He calls all these policies questionable under the law. Carrie and I agree. So should you. War. Under both the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution, Congress  not the president  has the responsibility to decide on whether to start a war. But President Obama, on the urging of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, took us into a war to topple the regime of Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi without even attempting to get authorization from Congress. According to the New York Times, June 18th, 2011, quote, President Obama rejected the views of the top lawyers at the Pentagon and the Justice Department when he decided that he had the legal authority to continue American military participation in the air war in Libya without congressional authorization. What will future presidents do with these expansive powers? Well, we don't know. It really depends on what the people decide, not just in November, but even here tonight. That's why this debate is so important, because the first step is to admit that there is a problem. Yes. Recent presidents have usurped the powers of Congress. If we're not willing to say even that, we deserve what we get."

    "data": "My book, which Michael just endorsed – Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  is actually quite consistent with Adam's opening statement. The book makes the point that Adam made as well, that our system has evolved a great deal. The original separation of powers scheme that Madison and other founders envisioned has changed a great deal. But that is because the world has changed. The United States has changed, and people demand more from the national government than they used to. I want to focus on, as Adam said, international relations. And let me hit a few of the most important issues that the critics of the Obama Administration have raised. So, first, a number of people  and perhaps Michael  he didn't explicitly mention this  argues that the counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and other countries are a violation of the president's constitutional powers, a usurpation of powers of Congress. However, all of these activities have authorization. There was, first of all, the authorization for use of military force, which Congress enacted in 2001, immediately after 9/11. This AUMF, as it's called, gave the president very broad authority to engage in counter terrorism operations against AlQaeda, AlQaeda affiliates, nations that harbor Al Qaeda, and related entities. The second AUMF in 2002 authorized the invasion of Iraq. That AUMF continues to be operative, like the first one, and authorizes combat operations in Iraq and in Syria to the extent that there have been spillover. And then finally, and most important, the president has in the constitution two sources of power that are relevant here. The first is the CommanderinChief power, and the second is what lawyers called the vesting clause, under which the executive power is vested in the president. It is widely agreed among lawyers that these two powers give the president the power to use military force abroad in limited ways to protect American interests, to advance American security. Presidents throughout history have relied on these  on this source of power for military operations overseas. Michael did mention the Libya operation in 2011. This operation was not authorized by Congress, as he mentions. In this case, the president relied on his Constitutional powers. And in doing so, he followed in the footsteps of his predecessors. President Clinton, for example, used military force without congressional authorization in 1999 in Serbia. He also did in Sudan and Afghanistan in 1998 and in Bosnia in 1993. President George H.W. Bush used military force without congressional authorization in Somalia in 1991 and in Panama in 1989. For Reagan, it was Libya in 1986, Grenada in 1983, and Lebanon in 1982. And these are only the most recent examples. Truman, for example, initiated the Korean War without congressional authorization, instead relying on his Constitutional powers. My next example are the drone operations which Michael alluded to, he didn't refer to specifically. But a number of people have argued that President Obama has exceeded his Constitutional authority by using drones to engage in targeted killings, including of an American citizen, actually a few American citizens, but one in particular, Anwar alAwlaki who was targeted. But once you grant that the president has military authority as a result of his Constitutional and statutory powers, it follows that he can use drones just the way he can use piloted aircrafts to launch military strikes. The American citizenship of Awlaki is legally relevant. It's often been the case that Americans in prior wars have gone overseas to join enemy forces. And when that happens, they lose the due process protections that one normally enjoys when one is on American soil. And then let me finish with two executive agreements that President Obama entered into. These agreements have received a great deal of attention, and again, people have criticized him for violating the Constitution. So the first such agreement was in 2015. It was the Iran nuclear deal. And the second agreement was in 2016, and that was the Paris climate agreement. And so what the critics say is that a president can enter into an international agreement only with two thirds consent of the Senate because, in the Constitution, there is a clause called The treaty clause, which says that when the president enters into a treaty he needs the consent of the Senate. However, there's a difference between a treaty and between the type of agreement that President Obama entered into. This type of agreement lawyers usually call an executive agreement or a political agreement. Now, in the case of a treaty, normally, a treaty will directly affect the rights and obligations of Americans or lead to direct legal commandment to an entity in the American government requiring it to do one thing or another. But in the case of these agreements, all that President Obama did was agree to use authorities that he had already has as a result of a statute. So in the case of the Iran nuclear agreement, he was required to raise sanctions against Iran under certain conditions. But there are plenty of statutes that allow him to do that, including the comprehensive Iran sanctions accountability investment act of 2010. And in the case of the Paris climate agreement, what he agreed to do was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Well, he has the authority to do that under the Clean Air Act, which, as the Supreme Court has recognized, allows him to issue regulations related to climate change. And to the extent that he needs additional authority under those agreements, he has to go to Congress as he has recognized. So the president has, in all these cases, acting with authority that he gets from the Constitution or from Congress, and therefore you should vote against the motion."

Wayne and I agree that factor farming is bad for people, animals, and the environment, and Adam's organization, Born Free, just recently joined the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which I also serve as a volunteer, the largest network of conservation professionals in the world. So, welcome, Adam. If you came here looking for the brawls that usually characterize this topic, I hope you're going to leave disappointed. Anthony and I are not zealots. We're not absolutists. We're realists. And that realism, along with our personal experience, is what leads us to the position that hunters conserve wildlife. And it's a position I hope you will vote in favor of this evening. We're going to share with you stories from Africa's poaching wars. We're going to talk about the success of the North American model of wildlife conservation. We're going to share figures and realities that we have gained through boots on the ground experience working with lions, elephants, cape buffalo, sable, in places where photo tourists will not go because they're what we call a nonpermissive environment, places that are dangerous, remote. But hunters will go there and hunters are the ones who are conserving these places. A little fun fact. Do you know that hunting concessions have conserved an area in Africa 1.7 times the size of the U.S. National Park system? That is a huge chunk of conservation land. How much of our national park system are we willing to put into jeopardy on the African continent? I'm going to share some stories about why hunters conserve wildlife. One place we work is called Coutada 11 in Mozambique. It's an area of about 2.5 million acres. To put that into perspective, it's an area about the size of Yellowstone National Park. As many of you probably know, during the 1990s Mozambique saw an absolutely brutal civil war, horrific. If you're not familiar with it, you should become familiar with it, because it's something that should never happen again. One consequence of that civil war was that Coutada 11 was completely wiped out of wildlife. Cape Buffalo were down to 1,200 in number. Sable, we're down to 44. People were starving. In came a man named Mark Haldane, South African, a professional hunter, and outfitter, a concessionaire. He took charge of Coutada 11 in partnership with the government of Mozambique. 1,200 buffalo became 21,000. Fortyfour sable became 1,400. In the last 10 years, he has invested one million dollars of his revenue to restore wildlife in this area. He invests $100,000 a year in antipoaching alone. And now because of that antipoaching work which my organization helped support with training, advisory assistance and procurement services, this is the only area in Mozambique that did not see a decline in elephant numbers during the last national elephant census. If that's not conservation, then I don't know what conservation looks like. But let's take a step back. Let's get a definition of conservation. The International Union for Conservation of Nature that I had mentioned previously that I served that Adam's organization is a part of, they define conservation as, and I'm going to read here because I want to make sure that we get this right, Conservation is the protection, care, management, and maintenance of ecosystems, habitats, species, and populations within or outside of their natural environments in order to safeguard the natural conditions for their long term permanence. Because of this definition, a scientific consensus has emerged through the IUCN, the largest network of conservation scientists in the world. There is a consensus that hunters conserve wildlife. The IUCN just recently sent a briefing paper to the European Parliament that was influential in convincing that parliament not to adopt trade bans that would interfere with African hunting programs. Now, you will always find scientists on the fringe who are willing to say, That's not true, who are willing to buck the consensus. Climate change deniers do this all the time. But for those of us who care about wildlife, we should listen to the consensus that hunters are an indispensable part of the conservation ecosystem. And this isn't to say that we're the only part. We need birdwatchers as much as we need duck hunters. This isn't an either/or question. This is about a holistic, sustainable approach to wildlife conservation that Anthony, myself, and the people who HOPE serves are grateful to be a part of because we want to pass down a rich, natural heritage that's filled with elephants, sable, cape buffalo, wolves, grizzly bears, whitetailed deer. And for all of those reasons I just said, you should vote in favor of the motion, Hunters Conserve Wildlife. Thank you."

    "data": "Walter Palmer used his wealth to travel halfway around the world to shoot a magnificent lion not for management, not for food, but to add another trophy to his home collection. In pursuit of more and more trophies as we see so many members of the Safari Club International, this globetrotting enterprise of killing the biggest and rarest animals in the world. Now, we are outraged as a nation and so many people around the world were outraged about it. And part of that is explained by our growing sensitivity to animals. We're less tolerant of factory farming. We don't like dogfighting and cockfighting. We don't accept horse slaughter for human consumption. There are all sorts of abuses of animals that we once accepted, but now don't meet our moral tests in our society. So there is obviously a very big ethical debate about trophy killing or other forms of hunting, sport hunting, and commercial trapping. I think there are gradations in that world. I think Walter Palmer and the other trophy hunting advocates who travel around the world to kill rare species are one category, and a guy in West Virginia or Pennsylvania who kills a deer to eat meat and fill the freezer is a whole other beast, if you will. And we're not going to really get into all the elements of that debate, because tonight we're talking about this motion, that hunters conserve wildlife. And I want to prove to you tonight, with Adam, that that is a really gross overstatement. It's really a bromide. It's something that's been repeated decade after decade, and there's very little evidence to support it at this time. You know, most hunters are going out into the woods for, you know, their own reasons. Walter Palmer traveled to Zimbabwe to kill a lion because he wanted to kill a lion and get a trophy. Other people want to go out and be with their friends or family members. Some like to experience nature. Some may do it for meat purposes. But most people are not going out to kill these creatures because they support conservation. If you do that, you can give money to a land trust, or you can support conservation in all sorts of ways  very tangible ways  to help creatures who were really facing so many pressures from those of us  our species  that is crowding so many of these animals out. You know, when you think about the United States, two billion acres is the land mass of this country. 700 million acres is owned by the federal government. Just 2 or 3 percent of that land has been purchased as a consequence of huntingoriented programs, like Duck Stamps or the federal PittmanRobertson Act, which sets aside money  it's a tax on guns and ammunition. Actually, all gun owners and ammunition buyers, not just hunters. There are many more people who have guns in the world than have an interest in hunting. So, it's a tiny percentage of the lands that has been preserved or saved from development. And when you think about the land trusts in this country, the nature conservancy, and hundreds and hundreds of other land trusts, almost none of them have a hunting orientation. They're out to save the land. They're out to protect wildlife because they just want it to be, not because they want to use these creatures and shoot them for recreation, for trophies, for other purposes. And you know, when we start to take a proper accounting, when we really think about conservation, we think about protecting land, saving threatened and endangered species, preserving ecosystems, let's think about some of the things that are the collateral effects of hunting. Hunters are one of the biggest sources of lead dispersed into the environment. Now we have copper shot, we have bismuth, we have steel. All of these forms of shot can be used by hunters, but we're putting millions of pounds of lead into the environment that's poisoning 15 to 20 million animals a year. Loons and other species  also, the highly endangered California condor. Why are we using lead when we have alternatives? If you're conservation minded, you're not going to randomly poison millions of creatures. We have captive hunts that are tolerated by the NRA and the Safari Club International, and other organizations in this field, where exotic animals are stocked in fenced areas and shot for a fee, in an openair slaughterhouse house sort of arrangement. It's disguised hunting. But all of the national hunting groups support it, they defend it. They oppose our legislative efforts to stop it. And many of these exotic species that they're shooting in the United States have escaped and they're colonizing our habitats. That's the reason we have wild boars in so many parts of the country that are degrading landscapes and are considered a nuisance by federal land managers and state wildlife managers. We have this Safari Club program globally  you want to get the Africa Big 5 award? You shoot a lion, a leopard, a rhino, an elephant, and a cape buffalo. You want to shoot  you want to get the Cats of the World award? You shoot five of the big cats. I mean, these folks are going after some of the rarest animals in the world. Hunting is not  and the idea of hunting as conservation, you know, it sounds like a wonderful slogan, but what are the details? What are the specific terms? Because they pay hunting license fees? Because they buy a Duck Stamp? Well, there's a tax on tobacco, and some of that money goes to the healthcare system. Does that make tobacco companies and smokers healthcare advocates? The oil companies are taxed under the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and some of that money goes to protect habitat. Do we think of the oil companies and the gas companies as leading wildlife and land protectors? No. It just happens to be that they're taxed because there are costs to the enterprise. And much of the money that is used, you know, for those purposes goes to just maintain the hunting program in a quasiagricultural program to provide more deer and more game animals for hunters to shoot, when the reality is there are dozens and dozens of other species that desperately need our attention. So, hunting is an ethical issue and it's declining in terms of its popularity, but the idea that hunting is conservation, that's not why anybody goes out into the woods when they want to kill an animal. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you. Tonight, we're going to show you how hunting has, in fact, protected wildlife and habitats throughout North America through this wonderful North American model. I was really happy to hear Wayne ask for details, because I could have  I have some. And I would like everyone else's opinion about some of the numbers that he's poohpoohed to see if they really are all that small. And the fact is, hunting provides a sustainable, repeatable model on which wildlife could be managed and protected. I want to give you some history first. At the turn of the 20th century, habitat loss and market hunting had had our species at the point of extinction. Bears, elk, moose, even whitetailed deer. Around this time, concerned hunters, including the editors of Field & Stream and New Yorker Theodore Roosevelt, pushed to set game laws, base wildlife management on science, and make it managed by the public. The principles that formed this are called the North American Wildlife Model. It still drives much of what we do for a simple reason. It works. The system is not perfect, but there is no other form of wildlife management that has the results that this model has had. Hunting is at the center of this story. It's a tool for managing wildlife, but it also makes hunters a powerful tool and advocate for wildlife  supporters of wildlife. But let's talk about numbers, some of those pieces of land and some of those programs that Wayne mentioned. Hunters provide 80 percent of the funding to fish and game wildlife agencies. There's about 37 million hunters in the United States, and every single one of them contributes. All told, sportsmen contribute a billion dollars a year to wildlife conservation. To me, that's not a small number. These funds come from a variety of ways. The first source of these funds is through hunting licenses. These monies go directly to the state that sold them, and these dollars can only be used for wildlife management and conservation. Big numbers, small numbers  since 1965, they generated $22 billion. Just last year, in 2015, they generated $821 million. Wayne explained Pittman Robertson. This is the excise tax on sales of ammunition. Something to know here is that this law was advocated for, lobbied, supported, by hunters  voluntarily. It has generated more than 12 billion for state wildlife management and conservation. Of those funds, 62 percent are used to buy, develop, and maintain wildlife habitat. Since the Act became law, states have purchased about four million acres of wildlife habitat, an additional 40 million acres are managed under agreements with private landowners. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service credits PittmanRobertson with rebuilding these populations of these animals and extending the ranges from wild turkey, whitetailed deer, mule deer, elk, black bear, bobcat, mountain lions. For example, in 1910, there were 20,000 elk in Montana. Now, there's 120,000  in large part, thanks to these monies. Mule, deer, all the other ungulates have had similar recoveries. What's that done? It's allowed wolves and mountain lions to make a recovery as well. Right now, money generated by PittmanRobertson is working to conserve wolves around the Great Lakes and run the wolf conservation program in Oregon. Nongame benefits as well. It's not just about hunters having more. Here in New York State there's efforts in the Albany Pine Bush area to protect the endangered Karner Blue Butterfly. This is a butterfly so rare that even the loss of a few could be devastating to the population. This program has received significant funds from PittmanRobertson paid for by hunters. The truth is, most of the budgets for wildlife management, which takes place on some of those federal lands that Wayne mentioned, come from these fees. Eighty percent of Wyoming’s budget comes from that. In Michigan it's 76. In Colorado it's 70. A third component is the federal Duck Stamp. Again, this was an idea made by hunters, lobbied by hunters, supported by hunters. It's generated $800 million in money for wetland conservation since its introduction with 98 cents of every dollar going to purchase wetlands or acquire easements that feed into the national wildlife refuge system that we can all enjoy. The Duck Stamp has preserved six and a half million acres of wetlands. Here in New York it's 20 thousand acres. I don't think that's so small. A fourth source of hunter generated income comes from the many nonprofit hunterrun conservation groups. These groups are organizations like Ducks Unlimited, the Boone and Crockett Club, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, Pheasants Forever, and many more. Let's look at Ducks Unlimited as just one example. This group protects wetlands for ducks, but because hunters know that wildlife needs intact, functioning healthy ecosystems to live, it also benefits insects, fish, salamanders, mink, martin, shrews, beavers, all the animals that depend on a healthy wetland. In 2014 and 2015 alone, DU raised $238 million that went to wildlife conservation. Eightyfive percent of that money goes directly into waterfowl habitat restoration and acquiring lands. I don't think that's a small number. With the money that is raised, DU has conserved more than 13.5 million acres of wetlands across North America. This doesn't take into account all the volunteer hours that hunters give working on grass roots conservation projects. What's important to note here is that these groups and all this money is all driven by people's love of hunting. They love the sports. They love the animals. They love the places. It's their desire to preserve these species, to preserve these places that drive all these efforts. When you consider these facts, this history, the billions, literally billions of dollars raised by hunters for conservation, the millions of acres preserved, the hundreds of species that have benefited, I think it's clear that hunting plays a very critical role in wildlife conservation, and that's why I hope that you will agree with me tonight and support this proposition."

    "data": "Thank you very much, John. It's interesting being the fourth speaker, because I have the benefit of hearing the 14 minutes of argumentation presented by the affirmative side of today's debate and I think I'd like to start my comments the same way Anthony started. He said something very interesting about hunting. He called it a sustainable repeatable model, which I think is a very interesting phrase, a sustainable, repeatable model. Unless you're the bull elephant that's been killed, taken away from the family system and the ecosystem depriving of the local community of ecotourism revenue for generation after generation, that doesn't seem to me to be sustainable. And obviously we've heard a lot of different arguments in these 14 minutes and I tried very hard to figure out how I can sum them all up in a simple way for you all in the time that I'm allotted. And I think the way I can best do that is with two words. Two very simple words to describe the entire argument for the affirmative of today's debate. Trust us. That is what they're really telling you. Trust us that politically we have the wherewithal in countries around the world to ensure that hunting quotas are set by potentially corrupt governments sustainably to ensure that it's based on the sound scientific evidence in biology to ensure that no animal is ever overhunted. Trust us. That law of setting bag limits and hunt seasons are always going to be followed to the letter by every hunter, Walter Palmer excluded. Trust us that economically, the revenue that's generated by every hunting license, every fee that's paid, $10,000, $20,000 to hunt a lion in Tanzania is actually going to go back into local communities, back into conservation on the ground where it matters most. Trust us and trust us that, as hunters, we are always going to be sportsmen and women who are ethical and do what is right by animals and never overhunt, never take too many. Trust us that the logic of these arguments hold the day. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what your vote was at the beginning of the debate, but at the end of the debate, if you can consider politically, legally, economically, reproductive biology and logic all dictate that hunters conserve wildlife, then yes, you have to vote in the affirmative. But I think what Wayne and I are showing today is that, that is a folly. And we have to take a slightly global view when we look at these things. So let's look at them one at a time politically. We have a regime in Zimbabwe, a very prohunting nation run by a dictator named Robert Mugabe whose cronies are taking over land, former farmlands, turning them into hunting concessions. But those hunting concessions are not just for the lawful sportsmen, the Walter Palmer of the world, and by the way, we really have to stop talking about the separation between the lawful sportsman and the poacher because I think he proved that the line all too often gets blurred. But in a place like Zimbabwe, those same hunting concessions were legal hunters are going with their permit to kill animals, you are having rhinos being poached for their horn, elephants being poached for their ivory, and those products being shipped off to Asia. In Tanzania, one of the bastions of hunting, a strongly prohunting nation always saying how our neighbors in Kenya don't have hunting. And look what's happening to the wildlife there. In the Selous ecosystem alone, you have the absolute decimation of lions, the bastion of the country because of overhunting. So, politically, we can see that globally there is no justification for the argument that hunters conserve wildlife. In fact, we see that politically, the deck is stacked against animals. Legally, Conservation International has done a study in which they show that you have Vietnamese poachers going in South Africa where each individual can only get one permit to hunt a rhino and they're bringing in people to hunt rhinos with those permits, including prostitutes from Thailand to take back the rhino horn because that's not commercial trade, that's a trophy. And they are taking that trophy back and it's finding its way into the black market. Legally, the deck is stacked against animals when we look at trophies. But economically is perhaps the most interesting argument of all because it's the one we hear all too often, that the hunter pays for the privilege of the thrill kill. The hunter pays for the privilege of killing animals for sport and, therefore, there is an absolute nexus between that payment of money and what happens on the ground. Well, let's look at some facts and, again, this is globally. A new study by CREST out of Washington, D.C., looked at the great bear rainforest in British Columbia and found that looking at ecotourism related to bears and other carnivores versus hunting, for ecotourism, you have 12 times more visitor spending than you do hunting, 11 times more direct revenue going to the government than you do from hunting and, in 2012, you have 510 jobs generated because of ecotourism and only 11 because of the hunting industry. Look at wolves in Yellowstone. Thirtyfive million dollars generated through ecotourism more than four times as much as hunting in the same area. And, lastly, I would leave you with three numbers. Just remember these three numbers, .27 percent, 1.8 percent, three percent. Looking at nations in Africa that have both ecotourism and hunting  and hunting, the type of big five hunting that Wayne discussed, in no nation that has that condition is more than .27, about a quarter percent of the GDP, generated from hunting revenue. Of all the tourism revenue combined, only 1.8 percent is generated from hunting. Now, I'm not mathematician, but that says to me that more than 98 percent is generated by ecotourism, a drastically different sum. And when Catherine talks about needing to think about the people on the ground in Africa, I'd say, If you really want to help the people on the ground in Africa, you help them with sustainable ecotourism models, not hunting models. And, lastly, three percent. The U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization and the hunting industry itself has noted that only three percent of hunting revenue actually makes it back to the local communities. The rest of it is held in government coffers and foreign operators. Remember, it's not the people on the ground in Tanzania or Zambia that are running these ecotourism operations  these hunting operations, it's foreign operations. And then biology  we know that in 1980, there were estimated to be 78,500 lions left in Africa. Today, there are fewer than 20,000. And this is a species that, for those same three decades, were hunted. American trophy hunters taking more than 500 lions on average, year after year, after year. I encourage you  since we've already talked about the IUCN, to go back on your computer. Look up the IUCN red list, and look at all the species that are listed as critically endangered, endangered, threatened, near threatened, and see how many of them have, as one of the factors threatening those species' survival overhunting. What we see time, after time, after time is that politically, legally, economically, biologically, and logically, the argument fails. Hunters overall globally do not conserve wildlife. And if we really care about both people and wildlife, we do need to generate sustainable models for the long term, and that's keeping animals alive, not dead. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you. Good evening. I have to tell you, if somebody told me 10 years ago that I'd be standing on stage in Manhattan, partnered with a progressive liberal Democrat Congressional candidate, arguing against corporate subsidies  I would have thought that as likely as seeing a panda perform brain surgery, or even more unlikely, seeing Donald Trump within 500 delegates of being nominated by the Republican Party. So, it's an odd evening in some ways, for me. Particularly, we're kind of an odd couple, Zephyr and I. Zephyr, of course, is from the left. I'm from the right. And yet, we approach this issue together, we come to the same conclusion. Not always do we agree on everything  in fact, this evening, we may wind up disagreeing on some things. But I think, to some degree, that gives us strength that builds our team in a certain interesting way, because we both represent major segments of the country. And the approaches of these segments of the country  which many of you may share one or the other, or somewhere in the middle  offer a consensus that something's out of control in Washington, that subsidies, unfortunately  and the other activities that go on down in Washington, some of which I participated in in my former career  are really driving the nation in a direction that's very troubling. Now, we could actually have a debate tonight of what does it mean to be a subsidy, because obviously, that's a very interesting discussion. Some of the things that I would support  constitutional expenditures of the government  some others would look at subsidies. Other things that Zephyr might support, that I would not support, I might look at as a subsidy. So, finding out what is a subsidy is very difficult to figure out. So, I'd like to take kind of the Potter Stewart approach, if you remember the justice talking about obscenity  which, a subsidy is an obscenity, and some discussions are easily conflated  which is, basically, you can recognize it when you see it. And most of the discussion of subsidies really needs to center on the vast amount of money that is purveyed to corporations and to others in this country, either through giving out money or through tax breaks. And we sort of know it when we see it. Zephyr is going to come up and she's going to make an argument that these things  these subsidies aren't fair, and they distort the economy. I am going to argue tonight, and right now, that we can't afford subsidies. We can't afford them economically. We can't afford them constitutionally. We can't afford them ethically. And we cannot afford them socially and politically any longer. Sure, it would be great if we had unlimited money in our country and we can give away anything to anybody who wants anything. That would be wonderful. But we don't live in that world. We live in a world of $20 trillion debt. $20 trillion. It's unfortunately something people have gotten so used to that they ignore it. But in a world where you have $20 trillion in debt, and you have a half a trillion dollars in a budget deficit, the fact that the Congress is appropriating, and the administration is giving out, $100 billion a year plus to corporate subsidies, and a $100 billion a year plus to tax breaks for corporations and others  special interests  that is a big chunk of the annual deficit that we run. And in fact, we can't afford this. So, we can't afford subsidies economically. We can't afford them constitutionally. And this is more of an argument, certainly, that comes from the right. But we have a constitution. And based on some of the recent political candidates, it's a good thing we do have a constitution, even if some of them aren't necessarily interested in all their provisions. But we as Americans have to protect our constitution. And one of the things the Constitution does is limit the scope of our federal government. Well, people in Washington  and these are people  Republicans and Democrats  don't really care about that. They expand the scope of our government. And unfortunately, this scope has expanded so much that the government is basically in everybody's lives and in every activity. And, as a consequence, lots of money flows out. And we shouldn't mistake the fact that when there's one dollar available, there is at least 10 lobbyists who are chasing that dollar. And those dollars, unfortunately, their subsidies and tax breaks are made by public servants. And unfortunately, these public servants are pilloried by these lobbyists, are set upon by the lobbyists. I know this very well, and I may know it better than anyone in the room because I was one of those lobbyists. And I'm telling you that every program has, attended to it, tons of lobbyists. And that gets to the ethics question. We can't afford it ethically. It is bred  the subsidy culture has bred a culture of corruption in Washington, where the special interests have tilted the playing field in a way that Americans are very sick of this, which brings us to the we can't afford this socially and politically. I think anyone who looks fairly at what's been going on politically in our country has noticed something, that there's a rebellion out there, whether it's the Bernie Sanders on the left or it's the Donald Trump, wherever he is on the right, or  among Trumps, Trumpians, or Ted Cruz. People are dissatisfied. Congress' ratings are so bad, their approval ratings are so low that people would actually rather have a colonoscopy than be in favor of Congress. That cockroaches are more favorable to people than congressmen, that, in fact  and this is my favorite  replacement referees in the National Football League are more popular than Congress. And a lot of it has to do, unfortunately, with the fact we have a culture in Washington about taking our money and giving it out to those who can lobby the best. And even good ideas, altruistic ideas, things that people say, Well, the government should be involved in, the truth is, unfortunately, we now live in a culture where companies go first to the government to get their advantage, and that's our money. And shouldn't that  the bureaucrats in Washington be making decisions that for  with our money, that people in the private sector perhaps might go into those activities and spend a lot more time and a lot more of their life being expert in? That is the question. I'd say the answer to that is no, that, in fact, our subsidy culture, our corporate subsidies are out of control. And while, again, I wouldn't eliminate everything, and certainly there are good things the government is doing, that they need to be doing, and I'm not an anarchist. The culture itself is pervasive and unfortunately is corrosive. And it has affected the nation in a dramatic way, and it needs to stop. So I hope you will support us with the resolution to eliminate corporate subsidies. Thank you."

    "data": "Bonus depreciation for horses. If you own a racehorse in the United States, you can treat it as a depreciating asset over a threeyear period. That's insane. It's corrupt. It's nuts to treat a pony as a depreciating asset for business purposes, and yet that's part of our tax code. Our tax code, our subsidy code, it's full of crazy, stupid, horrible subsidies. So now you're thinking, didn't he get the memo he's supposed to be arguing against this corporate subsidies, you know, Eliminate corporate subsidies. Well, my partner, Kate Gordon and I, we are not arguing in favor of every stupid, insane, corrupt, criminal subsidy by the federal, state, or local governments. It may very well be that most of them are worthless. But you have to vote against the motion if we can persuade you tonight that there are some significant public objectives that are served by corporate subsidies. Now, Jack Abramoff brought up the question of definitions. And the definitions of what is a subsidy vary. The very narrow definition is a direct benefit to a particular corporation or an industry. It's a tax break, it's a low interest loan, it's a loan guarantee. The problem is that isn't very much money when you define it that way as a share of the economy in a federal government. So in doing our research, what we've discovered is that people who want to drum up outrage about corporate subsidies have to throw in all sorts of other things which indirectly benefit corporations, including defense contracts, including the bailouts of the financial system, you know, in the great recession and so on. We will  that's fine. Whatever the definition is, our thesis is, there are two kinds of corporate subsidies, good and bad. Now, the bad one was like bonus depreciation for horses. You know, well, what are the good ones? What's a good  why would you ever give money directly or indirectly to a corporation to pursue a public objective? Well, there are basically three tests, in my view. The first is, would the company or the industry do this on its own anyway? If it would, then the taxpayer is being swindled, right? You know, this is just  there's no purpose to the subsidy. So that's the first test. If they're going to do it anyway, then you don't subsidize them. The second test is, can this public objective  and it could be climate change mitigation, it could be helping poor people afford heating in the winter, it could be having universal Internet access, whatever it may be. It could be promoting, you know, nano tech innovation. Whatever the public objective, could this be more efficiently pursued by other means? For example, could the government do it directly itself? Our government, we have a mixed economy. We don't have a purely capitalist system. We have a public defense department. We don't hire pirates, you know. We have a navy, right? We have a public K12 system. So, you know, you can do things directly through government agencies. However, in our country  and I think it's a good thing  much of our productive sector, which is really crucial to economic growth, manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, is in private ownership, and is driven by the profit motive. So unless we're going to nationalize the factories and the oil wells and these solar power plants and so on, then the government has to use other methods than direct government provision to pursue a public objective in some of these very important areas, which, most of them in the productive economy. Well, one of them is regulation. The government has the power of command. It can say, you're going to do this, corporation, and you're going to swallow the cost. It's just a cost of doing business in the United States. And this is appropriate sometimes. We do this with workers safety. We do it with pollution. Just the company is going to bear the entire cost of achieving this public objective and pass the cost on to the customers. There are other cases where you may not want the company to bear the entire cost or pass it on to its customers because there may be a larger public good, and it may make sense to share the cost among taxpayers as a whole instead of making the customers pay for it all. And then the final test of this threepart test is, do the benefits outweigh the costs? Because even if you  you know, if these other tests are met, if you're paying more than you're getting in benefits, it's a waste of time. Now, all of this is very abstract, so I'll give you a specific example. After 9/11, there's great concern among the public reflected in our representatives about the safety of transportation, obviously. In intercity bus transportation, which has grown in importance between New York and Washington, for example, in the last decade, was a source of concern. So the Department of Homeland Security has an intercity bus grant program. And this is a corporate subsidy in the purest form. It's the government writes checks to particular motor coach companies if they will  to help them comply with these federal security guidelines. To my mind, you know, this fits all of the tests. Would the buses have been doing these additional security measures otherwise? No. But can we know that? Because they weren't doing it. Could it be done otherwise? No, unless we're going to nationalize intercity buses. We don't have a federal intercity bus monopoly. It's a private industry. And is the cost worth the benefit? Say, well, you know, we've seen buses attacked in other countries. So if you compare the cost and the benefits, you may disagree. But  and this is a reasonable sort of thing. So if the bonus horse depreciation is an example of a bad subsidy, I would argue the intercity bus security grants  you know, this is one that makes sense. And so we just have to be very careful. Our opponents will persuade you that all corporate subsidies are a big pile of horse manure, and it's our task to persuade you to vote against the motion on the theory that when shoveling out the manure you don't want to mistakenly throw out any ponies that may be buried somewhere inside."

    "data": "Thank you. I am a huge admirer of Michael Lind and often agree with him. It's strange to be up here disagreeing on some things, because he certainly challenged my own thinking. And it is enjoyable to be here with a conservative with whom I often disagree, with Jack, but we do agree on this and I want to urge you to get away from the little examples and talk about this not as a semantic fight, but as a fundamental democratic fight. Because we have a crisis of corruption, a democratic crisis in this country and a key driver of that crisis of corruption is corporate subsidies. So I'm going to talk about three things. First I'm going to talk about how subsidies are used only when law and all other interventions have failed and we should recognize subsidies as a moment of failure not as a moment of success. Second, I'm going to talk about how the rise in corporate subsidies has led to a devastation, a decimation, of our small business economy, which is the heart and soul of so much of America. And third, I'm going to talk about how corporate subsidies change who we are at a very fundamental level, who we are as business owners, who we are as citizens, who we are as democrats, small d democrats. So first, very briefly, like Michael Lind, I believe that the government has a role in shaping policy. Should we be moving towards renewable energy? Or should we be moving towards fossil fuel? Do we want to have universal high speed broadband? Yes. These are serious questions that I think collectively people should come together and answer. However, I think the best way for government to intervene in most circumstance is by setting rules that create the opportunity for those renewable energy industries for that cable to develop. So when you have a subsidy it's probably because you have bad rules. We should have better rules and less cash handouts. That's my general view. Second, I want to talk about small businesses and I  you know, I really see, along with big industry, small businesses, family farms, as being fundamental to some of the best parts of a truly thriving economy. It's where innovation happens. It's where community happens. It's where new things are built. It's where we find the next, next thing. We had a 25year collapse in the small business economy in this country. If you look at what real small businesses are, they can't survive. I talked to a woman the other day who's shutting down her diner who said to me, Don't forget the mamas and the papas. The mamas and the papas aren't getting the cash handout. She said, I started my diner to get  so people could get a cup of coffee near Amenia, and right now all the big guys, she said, are coming in and they've got the cash and they've got the handouts and if we keep going this way everything is going to look the same and we can't compete. Now, she's right. She is right on the facts, because guess who gets corporate subsidies. It's not the metro diner. In fact, 75 percent of all corporate subsidies, 75 percent, are going to less than a thousand companies. Just think of a thousand companies in the Kingston area alone that aren't getting that. So it's a handful of big monopolists who are using their lobbying power to go in and get those subsidies and the small companies and the small family farms are getting shut out. Now that isn't to say those big companies don't use the small companies as fronts. They'll march them in and say like 82 percent of small family farms get some form of government subsidy. That doesn't mean they're actually getting the benefit. The reason they need those subsidies is because the overwhelming majority of cash, actual cash, is going to a handful of big ag companies. So we're using subsidies to compete against subsidies instead of creating real open playing fields. So what does this do to who we are? I think this is so important. I want to live in an economy where the farmer in Cooperstown wakes up in the morning and thinks how do I get a ground source heat pump in so I can compete better? Not what joke can I tell the congressman so he'll laugh so I can get some cash. Our corporate subsidy model as a way to do federal policy is turning us, as citizens, as business owners, as members of our communities, into beggars, into sycophants, into people asking for favors instead of innovating. And think about what that does to our communities. If two neighbors are competing against each other for who gets the favor from the Congresswoman, that tears apart a community. If they're competing against each other with  for who puts in the better ground for a heat pump, that's great. Everybody benefits. But when it's about power and bootlicking, that undermines who we are. Our country was built on the premise of  We need to build a society where everyone has an equal voice and is not afraid to speak negatively about the king or the person in power. A core premise of that is that we are no fears, no favors. That's the core premise of American society. We had a revolution to reject the culture of bootlickers and flatterers. What I'm really concerned about is not the examples on the margins, but that as a whole, the way we are making  even good people with good ideas are choosing to make federal policy is, they're saying, If we give out enough cash, we can change policy. And that is turning us into a culture which supports bootlicking and flattery. So, I urge you, in this vote, for those of you who are uncertain, for those of you who might find little examples that make you question, to say This is actually a core question about who we are, about democracy, about corruption, and about our future and to vote for the resolution. Thank you."

    "data": "So, I feel a little bit like we're at a celebrity boxing match, and we have the  you know, the comeback kid over here, Jack Abramoff, and the new kid star, Zephyr Teachout. And Mike and I are sort of the underdogs, but but the thing about those movie is that the underdogs always win, and then  and there's a reason that we will win tonight, which is that we are not absolutists. As Mike said, we concede there are bad subsidies that should end today. We concede that government should be fully in charge of certain things. Absolutely. Regulation can be very important. But most things fall in that middle ground. Most of you probably fall in that middle ground and  where you think there should be some wellregulated government intervention when it's necessary for a public purpose. So, let's talk about why we do subsidies. We've been doing it a long time. This is not new in American history. There's three big reasons that subsidies tend to happen. The first is promoting new technologies that the private sector can't get its head around. They're too risky. They're too new. We see a lot of that in subsidies through history. Paying the difference between the value of an activity to the private sector and the value to the public sector   a big reason we do subsidies. When the private sector doesn't see value in a proposition and needs the public sector. And then, finally, in times of crisis. The New Deal, of course, is a time when we did a lot of subsidizing. One of the big areas  and it's not in the margins, as Zephyr said, but really central, where we subsidize and have historically subsidized is energy. The top  Good Jobs First just did a subsidy tracker. They're a group that does a lot of antisubsidy work. They just did a subsidy tracker. The biggest subsidies since 2000 in this country have been energy companies, the single biggest one to a Spanish wind company, actually, that built wind turbines, with money from the Recovery Act. So, subsidizing energy is not new. We've been doing it for centuries. We've subsidized the transition from wood to coal. We subsidized the transition from coal to oil. Today we are looking at subsidizing a transition  I hope  away from oil and towards something different. Many of those subsidies  in fact, if you look at energy subsidies, most of them go to oil and gas. About $5 billion a year since 1918 going to oil and gas. Those subsidies are still happening. This would be a great example of a bad one. We give oil companies a manufacturing credit for drilling in the places where they find oil, if those places are in the United States. So, think about that for a minute. We're trying to give them the incentive to drill in the U.S., but the oil is in the U.S., so they already have the incentive to drill in the U.S., so it doesn't make any sense. It plays out badly. Montana gives this subsidy, North Dakota does not. They both sit on the Bakken shale. The only difference is Montana's getting about a million dollars less to its citizens because it pays this subsidy. On the other hand, as Mike pointed out earlier, we also give lowincome consumers a subsidy to help them pay their energy bills. That is money that goes directly to utilities to help pay energy bills. That is a corporate subsidy, but it's one that serves the public purpose that is not otherwise served by the private sector. To me, the big, you know, gorilla in the room on this is climate change. Climate change meets all of the categories that we have traditionally used when thinking about whether subsidies serve a public purpose. It is risky in the long term. It will create enormous economic risk if we don't deal with it. But there's not a lot of upside to dealing with it today if you're in the private sector. Oil is super cheap. Why wouldn't you just keep using oil? It's even cheaper today than it was two years ago. Why would anybody switch off of it if they were looking at their bottom line? They would do it if they cared about the longterm impact of climate change. That's not a private sector consideration most of the time. It involves new emerging technologies that aren't yet on the market, but that we need, and we need them quickly to build up and try to deal with this climate change problem. It's global in scope, it's global in scale. It isn't just regional, it isn't just one place pitted against another. It's everyone. We don't do that so well in the private sector. And if we don't take action today  and this is to Jack's point  if we don't act on climate change today, you don't want government in your lives, just wait. We don't act on climate change today, we are going to see FEMA taking over towns to save them from sea level rise, to save them from heatstroke. This is a hedge against future government action. So climate change, to me, meets all of the categories of sort of what makes it  what makes a subsidy good. And, you know, to Zephyr's point, I a hundred percent agree. I would rather see regulation. I would rather see a price on carbon. However, we keep not being able to do that politically. In the interim, we are putting carbon emissions into the atmosphere. That is a public problem. In the interim, we need to be incentivizing people to build these technologies to solve this problem. That is where subsidies come in. So just some good examples. Subsidies for solar, back in the 1970s, NASA creates the solar panel through a military project. Now, some antisubsidy people exempt the military from this conversation. The military is the biggest subsidizing organization in this country. It basically throws money at problems and doesn't worry that much if it's a bad bet. It happens all the time. One good example is the solar panels. The microwave is another good example. The Internet is another good example. GPS is another good example. So NASA creates the solar panel and puts a lot of money into it, loses a whole bunch of money. Private sector starts to get involved. The recovery act puts a lot of money into solar development. We now see solar 10 times cheaper than it was in 2000. It is now competitive with coal, which is on the decline. And that  and it now, I would argue, sunset that subsidy soon, because we're now past maturing technology and into mature technology. So this shouldn't be a debate about are subsidies  you know, are subsidies inherently corrupt? No. Should we deal with the corruption? Yes. Should we deal with inefficiency? Yes. But you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater or the pony out with the manure  [laughs]  just because you see corruption. To address one  one other, I think, good one. You know, many people will point to the government's loan guarantee program as a bad example of renewable subsidies. You actually look at that program, the government did a good job with it overall. Three  or 2 percent default rate on the loans from the recovery program. What was the one big default? Solyndra. What was the rest of the program? Successful. Better default rate than any bank, better default rate by far than venture capital. That is a program that worked, and I would stake, you know, my reputation on this stage by that. So again, I would just say, you can't say this is on the margins. You can't say this is a semantic issue. This is an issue, particularly with climate change, a big, hairy problem the private sector isn't equipped to deal with on its own. This is an area where we need some government intervention. We would argue that you should vote against the motion, because you eliminate corporate subsidies, these are the kinds of programs you're eliminating. Thank you."

    "data": "Hey. I can't possibly be talking about artificial intelligence right now without remembering Marvin Minsky who is my dear mentor who just passed away very recently. And Marvin was infinitely sweet to me. And decades ago we would have the same argument, more or less. The spirit was a little different though because back then it seemed a little clearer where the line was between the philosophy and the technology. So Marvin would argue the hard AI position and he was largely the author of a lot of the ideas that I suppose I find myself arguing against now. Oh, but he loved to argue. And I just remember these arguments with such joy. And I wish that people who have come along since retained that sense of openmindedness and didn't take it all so seriously. I feel as though the ideas about AI have evolved into something of an orthodoxy, where they started off as an element of good humor and camaraderie. And I regret seeing that. And I wonder if similar progressions happened with some of our great religious and philosophical traditions. It's been interesting to see it. So, from my perspective, as a practitioner, I must add, I  my friends and I sold the Machine Vision company to Google. I'm in the thick of it. I'm not antiAI algorithms. I make them, you know? And I'm fascinated by them. So, from my perspective, there has to be a division made between the work itself  the engineering and the science on the one hand, and then on the other, the storytelling about it, the narrative that we have about it, the fantasy life of it   perhaps the religion of it. These are two distinct things. It doesn't mean one is good and one is bad, but they're just different sorts of beasts. So, to say, What is the promise of an area of research? We fundamentally don't know. It's research. It's basic research. We just observed gravity waves for the first time. Does that mean we'll suddenly have antigravity devices? Well, you know, maybe someday. We have absolutely no clue what we're going to discover. And in the same sense, we currently don't know what a thought is, in terms of scientific description. We can kind of find collections of neurons that seem to active at certain times. It's provocative. We can replicate certain functions. It's provocative. Do we understand how brains work? No. And yet, the work is fascinating, the work is important. A lot of our existential threats as a species involve great complexity. We wouldn't even know about climate change if it weren't for masses of sensors networked together that would allow us to get a big picture. We would be blind to our perils without it. So, to say that there isn't promise in pursuing science information systems and sensing systems, and algorithms to understand it all, like the  it would be crazy to argue that. I can't imagine any serious person taking that position. So, the only form of this proposition that I can possibly argue against is this other realm, the fantasy life, the culture. And here, I do find myself not enjoying it. And I'd like to just say a few things about where it fails. And this is rather personal, perhaps, but I will share it with you. One issue is, as an engineer, if I say, Oh, I'm making this algorithm into something that's intelligent, or conscious, or whatever  or cultured, or whatever it is  form an engineering point of view, I can't define those terms. So, it makes me nuts. I have no baseline. And this is a really crucial, crucial point. A lot of the systems you call smart systems are kind of derailed from the empirical process. As an example, I frequently review student work. And some people say, Well, here I've made an intelligent system. For instance I saw a machine that makes beverages. And it had quite fancy software. And it's to choose the beverage for a person. People found it hard to use. And what I'm saying is nobody cares how fancy your algorithm is. The only thing you can measure is how well the machine works, in the end. So, if you don't define a baseline that's measurable, you're off in fantasy land. And this  this might seem like a bit of a wonky point to you, but it's absolutely crucial. Engineering without clear concrete grounding in reality goes off the rails and does become dangerous. So, for a more important example, if you have some sort of drone that goes around killing the wrong people, whether it did so because of an intelligent algorithm that made the wrong decisions, or just because it's malfunctioning  who cares? That distinction is not actionable or meaningful. The only thing that matters is whether people can use machines that we design responsibly, with intention. That is the meaningful question. Everything else is fantasy. And so, adding this whole layer about power transcending and everything, it's  it just confuses matters. There is an economic angle to it. I love automatic machine translation. I love that you can go online and get something converted to German automatically. My own lab does that. We have realtime Skype translation now. But the only way we do it is by scraping the efforts of millions of translators who don't even know what's happening to them to get the examples. And in order to have the fantasy that this thing is a freestanding creature, we're pretending these other people don't exist and we're creating potentially a massive wave of technologydriven unemployment that doesn't need to happen. We shouldn't be shrinking the economy over a fantasy, if we just acknowledge that the people are just contributing in new ways. Their Go games are informing a Go algorithm. Pay those people instead of having to resort to some sort of weird socialist solution. You know, this fantasy of these artificial creatures makes us ignore our own lives, our own contributions. And so, it creates a needless economic peril  absolutely silly. But then I have to say something else. I understand that for many people, these ideas of AI have become very tender and dear to them. They've become part of the way they think about their lives, and their loved ones, and their future. They think they might become immortal or something. I have absolutely no interest in ridiculing or opposing that. I absolutely believe in religious freedom, and I would never, never, never speak against somebody's beliefs. I respect them. All I ask for is the separation of church and state. Without a separation of church and state, there can be no religious freedom. Never more true than when it comes to AI."

    "data": "Thank you. It's my pleasure to speak on  in favor of the motion that we should trust the promise of artificial intelligence. And in thinking about this question, I thought the major theme sort of orbited around three key words. And these words came to me when I asked myself, Well, what do we mean by the promise of AI? As Jaron said so well, there are so many different words thrown around. Define your terms. So, to me, the promise of AI revolves around the three terms: replication, and application, and then fascination. So, with regard to replication, the promise of AI is that we will be able to replicate the human mind. And that is a  you know, a startling statement. It's a  kind of an aweinspiring statement, because, I think, for most of us, for all the beauty and credulousness that we have about life around us, human minds are just like the most awesome things anybody can imagine. So now we're talking about replicating. The promise of AI is that we can replicate the human mind. But I believe that this promise will be fulfilled because we're not talking about replicating the structure of the human brain with the hundreds and billions of different subtle neural connections, of which, as Jaron says, we have slight knowledge. Instead, we're talking about replicating the function of a human mind, much in the way that we're not able to replicate a bird, that we're able to replicate flight. And certainly, the flight that we have with an airplane or helicopter is not the same as the flight of a hummingbird, but it's flight nonetheless. And the promise of artificial intelligence is not that we will replicate every little nuance of a biologicallyhuman mind, but it will be a replication of human consciousness, nevertheless. The second term that to me kind of embraces the concept of the promise of artificial intelligence is the term application. So, from replication to application. What do we mean? The promise of AI is that this stuff will be good for things, that we will really have uses for artificial intelligence. Otherwise, why bother developing it? And in fact, lots of people all over the world are enthralled with the promise of AI. We talk about it being helpful in helping to navigate our airspace, our ground space, our traffic. We talk about it being helpful in terms of health care, discovering cures for new diseases  for  new cures for diseases. The application of artificial intelligence that I find most amazing is the application of it to diseases of the mind, specifically diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's. And if we are able to go ahead and develop artificial intelligence so that it can serve as a kind of mental wheelchair, something that a person that has lost a lot of the faculties of their mind can instead rely upon because it provides a pretty damn good replication of their thoughts, of their responses, of their ability to recognize loved ones and respond to one, the ability to talk and form sentences and have an interior sense of reality. That promise of artificial intelligence, I believe, will come to pass because there's an enormous demand for it. Everybody who thinks about it wants to contribute to it in some part, small or large, depending on their capability and their skills. So I think it's all of the incredible applications of AI that will pull AI forward into the future and realize its potential. Finally, once we've replicated our minds and once we've been able to develop applications that makes these AIs so useful to us and such an important part of our life, far more than a personal digital assistant, far more than a great educational tool. In fact, it's a mind. It's something that we develop a relationship with. The next thing that comes to me is fascination. We will love these AIs. We'll love them in the same way that we love our cats and our dogs, that we love our friends, ones that we see distantly or the ones that we see frequently, because if it is a replicated human mind it'll have all the cool features of human minds, being able to answer questions, be able to really frame the rest of the sentence before a sentence is finished, be able to feel empathy and when we're sad help us feel better and we're happy join in that joy. Now part of the fascination of AI is that I believe the fascination part will only attach to the friendly AI, and this is why I believe when people offer a promise of AI as it being friendly and not be kind of the scary AI that you see out of Hollywood, I think that is a reality that we can expect to pass. Our fascination with AI will be for the AI that is friendly to us. We have no fascination with cars that don't stop when you put on your brake. In fact, we run from them. We have no fascination with stoves that when you turn on the stove they explode. We don't buy those. AI will arise in a natural environment in which humans are the agents of selection. We will select for the friendly AI and we will stamp out the unfriendly AI. So I believe that the promise of AI will be a good one and we should believe it because the environment in which AI evolves will be a human selection environment and the mass activities of hundreds of millions of people will select for the friendliest AI. This does not mean that there will never be bad AI. This does not mean that there will never be broken applications and that some replicated minds will be as messed up as people who are suffering from something like an antisocial personality disorder, but ultimately it will be the efforts of millions of individual hackers throughout the world in a decentralized process drawn forward by the promise of the positive applications of AI, such as helping to save relatives and loved ones that will result in a beautiful AI that will be the fascination of all of us and therefore will be a definite survivor in the future to come. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you, John. So this is a big deal. Very, very big deal. You just heard Martine given an extremely good speech in which she talked about replicating the human mind. Nobody laughed. You all sat there. You took that seriously, the notion that we can replicate our minds, that they'll live forever in the cloud or some other digital space is not outrageous. Jaron might argue it's not practical at this very moment, but it isn't outrageous. This is a huge issue. The notion that we can replicate ourselves, our intelligence, our being, our identities, our souls, whatever other word you want to use. So this is not a debate irrelevant to the future. Indeed, it is probably the central debate of the 21st century for better or worse. Important to remind ourselves of this debate, we are not talking about trusting artificial intelligence. That is not what Jaron and I are arguing against. We're arguing that we shouldn't trust the promise of artificial intelligence. We're not against the technology in itself. That is not the subject of the debate tonight. Jaron talked about the Separation of Church and State. We talked about this over lunch today. What I think he means is that we need to separate the science from the belief. And, all too often in this enormously important debate about whether or not we should trust the promise of artificial intelligence, of smart machines that are indeed so smart that they are able to replicate us as a species both collectively and individually, Jaron is arguing that we're muddling them up. Jaron is arguing that there's too much state in the church and too much church in the state. And the philosophers are intervening. The philosophers are telling us that this science is good, is moral, is liberating. And that's, I think, the argument that our team is making, or certainly that I am making. It is that there's a problem not with the technology but with its promise, with the ideology around that technology. We already heard a little bit about it from Martine who talked about something called good versus bad AI. I have no idea who she can make those moral judgments. I have no idea how you moralize I  AI unless you humanize it, which itself is deeply problematic. But the problem today, I think, is that the philosophers have got hold of this technology and they're presenting it as liberation theology. At least some of them are. We've been through this, of course, before in the middle of the 19th century in the midst of industrial revolution. The philosophers got hold of that. Marx thought the Industrial Revolution would free us from work, would free us from inequality. He was of course entirely wrong. And we have a similar kind of discourse, a similar kind of philosophical debate emerging today about the promise of AI. We're told that this AI will liberate us from our bodies. That's really what Martine is saying, that we'll live forever, that our minds will be replicated, they'll be up in the cloud. We'll never die. If we go insane, if we get Alzheimer's, somehow our essence, our kernel will remain. We're told that AI will liberate us from work because we'll have these smart machines which will do our labor for us. They'll drive our cars. They'll do our medicine. We'll go to an artificial intelligent agent, an algorithm to be taught. Perhaps one benefit is we'll avoid lawyers, but apart from lawyers, I worry deeply about the impact of AI on the expert professions of the 19th and 20th century. The very professions that represent the backbone of our economy. The problem with this promise is it's not being thought through. It's being thought through philosophically, idealistically. We're not thinking about it in the context of the real world. We're not thinking about it in the way in which these technologies  and we've already had a great deal of example of this during the digital revolution, that in spite of all the great promise of the Internet, and I've written extensively about this  in spite of all its great promise of democracy and egalitarianism and opportunity, it's actually created new elites. The promise of artificial intelligence, these grand philosophical frameworks, they forget about the realities. Jaron already talked about the art  the AI of language being owned and people of labor being appropriated. Who is going to own these platforms? Will it be Google? We all love Google, of course, in some ways. And yet, Google is the largest, the most valuable, the most powerful company in the world. Google are the ones who just made the breakthrough when it comes to this artificial agent being able to play Go. Google is pouring billions of dollars into AI, as is Facebook, as is Amazon, as are the other giants of Silicon Valley. Do you trust these guys to benefit mankind? Do you think they care about us? These aren't bad people or bad companies, but they're focused on profit. They're focused on monopoly. They're focused on owning that technology. We haven't thought this stuff through. The promise is scary. The promise is that the technology is moving way faster than we are  politically, culturally, existentially. We're not ready for this yet. We're not ready to replicate ourselves, whether it's in 50 or 100 years. We haven't thought it through. We can't imagine the cultural, the social, the economic impact. We haven't thought about AI and the way it will destroy labor, destroy jobs. What are we going to do when we have these machines that do everything for us? How are we going to create value? How are we going to feed and clothe ourselves in a world where all this technology will be owned by increasingly monopolistic companies? So, we can't, at the moment, trust AI. We can't trust its promise. One day, perhaps. But there are a lot of problems still to be resolved. And for the moment, I would strongly argue that you should not trust the promise of AI. Thank you."

    "data": "So, it's been very useful. We've narrowed down to, I think, what is an intelligible question, because obviously, Martine and I don't want to defend the most extreme hyperbole in this debate. But there is an ideological question around promise. And it's an ideological question that I would frame as the promise of human intelligence itself. And that is that artificial intelligence is a crystallization, a condensation, a manifestation of human intelligence, an extension of our capacity. And the promise is the same promise that we have been suggesting since the Enlightenment, that human beings, by taking control, by understanding how we think, and understanding the world  that we can take control of the natural, and political, and social circumstances that determine our affairs and make a better world. Now, the anarchist philosopher John Zerzan, I think, has the most trenchant critique of this. He thinks we went off the rails when we invented symbolic thought. As soon as we began to have language, we were downloading the contents of our minds onto external storage media and uploading them again through our eyes  we became cyborgs. That was the beginning of the end of the human project. I would argue that if you share my intuition that it's better to be alive in the 21st century than to have been one of our huntergatherer or peasant ancestors, an intuition that it's better not to have a gutful of intestinal worms, better to live to 80, better to have literacy, better to be less likely to be killed in a violent death, less likely to live in a life of slavery and oppression  there is something about modernity, and this promise of the Enlightenment, that I think we should explore. And artificial intelligence, I would argue  I have a slightly different definition that Martine does. I would argue that artificial intelligence has been with us for a while. Artificial intelligence can be reframed as the codification of the way that we do things together. Civilization is a form of artificial intelligence. It's what allows us to build cathedrals, and aqueducts, and banking systems. It's what allowed us to create laws and universities, and standard operating procedures. And today, that crystallization is taking the form of workers figuring out how to make things faster, and better, and smarter. And yes, change in the nature of work and ways that we should discuss. Today, artificial intelligence is applied to our genomes, to our healthcare systems, to trying to figure out how to diagnose and treat disease in ways that yes, no one physician or nurse will ever be able to comprehend, that we will be able to put in the hands of every healthcare provider and in the hands of ourselves. Those tools which will allow us the empowerment of understanding our own bodies. And this AI today is allowing us to understand the ecosystem, allowing us to understand the myriad of consequences that we are wrought  that we have wrought on the ecosystem, to mitigate, to predict, and to reverse those trends. It is also armies figuring out who to kill and how to kill the most efficiently. It is also advertisers and totalitarian governments figuring out how to suppress dissent and how to manipulate opinions. It is stockbrokers trying to figure out the best ways to exploit workers and accumulate wealth into the hands of the .1%. So, reason and technology can be applied to all these different ends. And the question of the difference between one end and the other is a value difference. It is a difference that comes out of the values, as I said, of the Enlightenment. If we fight for free and equal societies in the future, the applications of technology  including artificial intelligence, will be applied in free and equal ways. But our decisions to be pessimistic about artificial intelligence will have no effect on the application by China or North Korea, or other authoritarian regimes. It is our own embrace in liberal democracy of these powerful tools, making our society as strong and as effective as possible that will determine its future. So, future AI will allow us to understand the complexity of the genome, unlock health and longevity for our children. It will not determine whether there's universal access to health care. That is on us. Future AI will allow us to displace routine labor and make possible abundance and leisure for all. But it will not tax the rich. It will not determine if we create a safety net, and universal basic income so that we can all benefit from that universal abundance. That is on us. Future AI will allow us to make better collective decisions, to understand the consequences of our actions. But it will not determine whether we have a totalitarian government or a democratic one. That is on us. Focusing on AI as either a panacea or a cause of social ills is a distraction from the political project that will allow us to use AI and all technologies for good versus ill. It's the flip side. Technology itself does not determine these outcomes. We need to focus on creating the political contexts so that these powerful tools, the productive tools that we've been working on for tens of thousands of years, will be applied in the best possible way. So, I urge you to vote against this proposition, the proposition that we not trust the promise of AI, because if you do vote for it, you are voting against the promise of human intelligence itself. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. I'm very pleased to be here, and I want to acknowledge at the outset that we are all here tonight debating free speech because it is still valued on campus. But it is also true that we are debating free speech because its values are under siege. At the University of South Carolina, students have been investigated for discrimination for advocating free speech, for holding a small free speech event, displaying posters describing recent campus censorship cases. They were investigated after a few students complained that the posters were offensive and triggering. At a California college, students had to go to court to vindicate their right to distribute copies of the Constitution on Constitution Day. These are not anomalous cases. They are typical. Speech policing of faculty, students, and speakers has become routine. You could look it up at TheFire.org. For now, I'd like to review some of the ideas behind his hostility toward free speech. And also, to note the role of government censorship on private as well as public campuses. My partner, Professor McWhorter, will talk about how we regard and respond to ideas. He will elaborate on the meaning of free speech. Campus speech codes date back decades. This is not a new debate. But it has intensified in recent years, partly in response to guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Education. President Obama has criticized the clampdown on student speech, but his own administration is responsible for some of it. The Education Department has declared that Title IX requires all colleges and universities receiving federal funds  which is basically all of them  to restrict verbal harassment, especially sexual harassment, in allegedly hostile environments. The trouble is that the administration defined harassment quite broadly, more broadly than it has been or should be defined under the First Amendment  so broadly that it may consist of nothing more than speech of a sexual nature considered unwelcome by some students. Title IX has been turned into an ad hoc national campus speech code, as the investigation of Northwestern professor Laura Kipnis has shown. Kipnis was investigated after publishing an article on sexual politics in the Chronicle of Higher Ed. She's a tenured professor who vigorously challenged the investigation and debunked it in a scathing expose. And she escaped punishment. But it's easy to imagine the effect of this on untenured junior faculty. Now, courts may yet decide the legality of these contested Title IX guidelines, but in the meantime, the government is censoring campus speech. How did this regime evolve? It is partly a response to concern about free speech, and campuses struggling with diversity and the problem of sexual violence. It is practically axiomatic on many campuses that speech considered hateful to disadvantaged or vulnerable students is a form of discrimination or even violence. Whenever people want to restrict speech, they call it verbal conduct. Free speech is said to be an instrument of privilege used to silence the relatively powerless. This means that equality requires the unequal distribution of speech rights, but also means that the right of listeners not to be offended can be elevated over the right to speak, which means that your right to speak may defend on the unpredictable, subjective responses of your audience. But free speech can't consist simply of what people don't mind hearing said. But words are weapons, advocates of restricting hate speech like to say, and I agree, words are weapons. That's precisely why we protect them. Weaponized speech is the ideal form of nonviolent political combat. It is especially important to people in positions of relative powerlessness. It has fueled virtually every moment for social change and social justice, including today's student protest movements which you might point to as evidence that free speech is thriving on campus. The trouble is that so many of these movements aim to punish and suppress other people's speech by labeling them micro aggressions, forms of discrimination. Again, it's called verbal conduct, or even likening it to violence. But there are essential, it seems to me, extremely obvious and important differences between the metaphoric violence of the word and actual violence. And that's a distinction that is often lost in these debates. But when you confuse the metaphoric power of allegedly hateful speech with actual violence  and I think this is important. When you confuse the metaphoric power of hate speech with actual violence, you risk justifying the use of violence in response to speech. So I urge you to vote yes on the motion, that free speech is threatened on campus. And I hope you'll agree that that is not a good thing. Thank you."

    "data": "Wendy, I'm afraid I'm going to have to respectfully disagree with you. Free speech is alive and well in America's universities as you will see if you walk around this campus. Debate and discourse in classrooms, dining halls, dormitories, and even drama school stages, as our gathering tonight proves. Tonight may seem special with the lights and cameras and a distinguished moderator. But what is truly special is that what we are doing is what we are supposed to be doing on campus, thinking, arguing, speaking, listening, agreeing, and disagreeing. And this happens in every imaginable way on campuses across Connecticut and our nation. I teach here as do David Brooks, Stan McChrystal and people of all different political persuasions. We're on a campus, after all, where one of the most popular courses sings the praises of Henry Kissinger. I have debated the Yale Political Union in the past year, so has John Ashcroft and Bob Levy, chairman of the Cato Institute. William F. Buckley's debate with Gore Vidal is a tradition to which Yale  we Yalees lay proud claim. I'm a philosopher, so I'm going to begin where my tribe often begins, with Aristotle. In book one of The Politics, Aristotle says that the gift of speech is given to us to lay  to lay out the expedient from the inexpedient, the just from the unjust. And these lines are extremely relevant to our current debate. Contemporary students stand accused by some of violating the liberal idea  ideal of free speech. In fact, many students are using the gift of speech as we western philosophers were taught it was meant to lay out the inexpedient and unjust. As Mark Lamont Hill said on ABC back in November, August 9th, 2014 started everything, right after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson. We see protests all around the country. And these young people haven't stopped protesting. They haven't stopped talking, and so we're raising other issues. Police killings of unarmed black citizens began to get more media attention, a catalyst for a social movement that swept the nation, and as always, swept up our campus, campuses with it. We must consider that it is actually the ones who criticize these students for being cry bullies who are the threats to free speech. Some cast today's campus climate as attention between antiracism and free speech. This is a false dichotomy. We've seen this pattern before. Those guilty of something often accuse others of the purported crime. We must consider the possibility that what is really happening is that the language of free speech has been coopted by dominant social groups, distorted to serve their interests, and used to silence the marginalized. All too often when people cry for justice and represent that it threats the free speech, what is really meant is just be quiet. A senior philosophy major told me that my class was the first in which she had encountered any woman or person of color on the syllabus. And I'm wondering, what's a coddled, safe space then? Is it one in which white men like me are never exposed to the idea that women have minds? Exercising free speech to urge someone not to say or do racist things is not the denial of the right to say racist things. When I ask my mother to stop nagging me  which I do a lot  I am not denying her the freedom of speech. Many of us believe racist statements are false. So when we call a statement racist, what we're doing is we're putting into question a perceived falsehood. And how could that be in tension with the mission of the university, which is the pursuit of truth? The act of protesting is not the denial of free speech. It is the exercise of free speech. What's happening on more  on campuses today is more speech, not less. Voices too often unheard are kept at the margins, are finally being raised and being heard. A central purpose of the university is to allow disputes that too often happen on the battlefield to occur in campus  on campus and in classrooms instead. I for one am glad that robust discourse, sometimes difficult, is taking place on our campuses. When I hear that student protesters  protests are silencing and intimidating people, I scratch my head. Students are advocating for open political discussion, sometimes heated, and justice for all. That is what we philosophers were taught freedom of speech is. As a philosopher, it is especially fitting that we debate this topic in a forum much like the one envisages by Aristotle. The resolve is: free speech is threatened on campus. Our very gathering tonight proves that it's not. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you very much. It's often said, as Jason just reminded us, that students and professors and administrators who are painting today's college campuses as hot beds of racism, sexism and other kinds of description, are just whining, are just crybabies. That is definitely a highly flawed argument. In terms of the protests that we're seeing, there are many valuable points. If I had been an undergraduate at Princeton, I would always have been appalled, whether or not anybody told me to be appalled, at Woodrow Wilson being emblazoned on buildings. I completely get that. If there is a culture that would allow someone to say that only white women are allowed at a fraternity party, well, that should be shouted to the heavens most certainly. And furthermore, the idea that we're ever going to have perfectly free speech on a campus is ridiculous. That is boilerplate for editorials because no college campus worth the name would have completely free speech. We're not going to have a debate about whether or not genocide is okay. We're not going to have a debate about whether or not slavery is okay. Those things are not subject to free speech. We're going to let those things alone. They are things that one must let pass. Our problem today is that we're being taught by many people that, that zone that genocide and slavery and women occupies is much more crowded than it is. Many of the things that we're being told we shouldn't even discuss and that the mere discussion of it constitutes a space becoming unsafe are really things which in an intelligent and moral environment people will reasonably have discussions about. So, for example, does affirmative action continue forever and for what reason? One can debate the various places it might go. To bring it up, however, does not make somebody an immoral person. What is cultural appropriation? What is the line between cultural appropriation and cultural mixture? That's a tough one. It's subtle. It's worth debate. It's not a matter of just shouting people down if a certain subject comes up or if a certain action is performed. How perfect do we want society to be in the sociological sense? Micro aggression is real. I've written about it. How do we respond to it? What constitutes a micro aggression? What we're dealing with is a general argument which indeed has become higher pitched since Ferguson in favor of a leftist position. And I am glad. However, what we're too often being told is that the leftist position is truth incarnate and that on that position, if on no other one, there can be no further debate. And that's problematic. It's problematic on a campus, for example, because it's fundamentally antiintellectual. It simply does not involve what most of us would consider cogitation or constructive thoughts. So, for example, too often language is being misused. Safe space is not an argument simply because both words begin with S. Black body is not an argument simply because both words begin with B. The word, justice, is not an argument. Justice is very complicated, as Aristotle told us very well. We have to be careful how we use language and understand that these things are not, as one might say, black and white, or the idea that, that which offends me is wrong is anti intellectual. It simply isn't logically that simple. They give you one because we're talking about real things here, the idea that if you are black, which I think I am, and you are in a classroom and you're asked to represent the black experience, that, that's racist, okay. I remember how that felt. I didn't like it either. But the idea that, that constitutes a micro aggression, that, that's racist, that's up for debate, given that often affirmative action is justified on the basis of we, black students, doing exactly that in classrooms. That's hard. It's worth debate. It's not as simple as we're being told. Instead I'm afraid that what we're seeing on one campus after another is an idea that shaming people and shutting them down via the ample use of buzzwords and slogans and sonorous cadence is somehow okay when it comes to espousing a leftist agenda. It's as if we're at the end of ideas. I don't think that that's appropriate, and I highly suspect that a lot of people watching this and listening to this are not scratching their heads at the idea that this shaming and shutting down is happening. Frankly, there is no possible disagreement. It is happening. The only question is whether or not that's justified. Many reasonable people would suppose that it's not justified. And for that reason, and only that reason, I think we can say, Free Speech Is Being Threatened on College Campuses. I think you should think so as well. Thank you."

    "data": "I recently spoke at a large, predominantly white university, where I met Damien [spelled phonetically], a black undergraduate man who shared with me a disturbing story. Damien was the only nonwhite person in a large, 200person lecturestyle engineering course. It was a very rigorous course, Damien said. At the beginning of one class session, the professor told seven students who had received perfect scores on a previous test that they were excused from class and exempt from the remaining exams in the sequence, which is a really generous deal, right? As the seven students began to gather their belongings, they walked down the stairs of the lecture hall, one by one. And according to Damien, they had to walk past the professor's podium to get out of the classroom door. Six of them exited the lecture hall uninterrupted. It was only the seventh, Damien, the only black student in the class, who was stopped by the professor, who said to him, Wait, you got 100 percent? in a tone of shock and disbelief. Some version of this happens over and over again to students of color on predominantly white campuses. I repeatedly hear stories like this one at just about every single institution where we go  the center that I direct at Penn, where we go to assess the campus racial climate. Damien was embarrassed. He was hurt. But he said nothing to his professor. Students who participate in our climate studies often tell us that they say nothing to their professors, to administrators, to campus police officers, and to their peers when they say hurtful things to them that contaminate their experience on predominantly white campuses. Proponents of the motion we are debating tonight would likely argue that maybe Damien was being too sensitive  or for sure, it would have been outrageous, had he told the professor that what he did to him in that lecture hall that day felt racist to him. My debate partner, Jason Stanley, and I intend to convince you that it was Damien's  not the professor's  freedom of speech that was suppressed in that moment. What we saw at the University of Missouri, here at Yale, and on dozens of other predominantly white campuses across our nation last fall were students of color finally exercising their freedom of speech. Ryan Wilson, a Yale undergraduate who is my guest tonight, wrote a beautiful column in the student newspaper here addressing the Halloween costume incident that occurred here last semester. Ryan explains in his column that Yale's InterCultural Affairs Committee sent out an email encouraging students to consider the unintended consequences that wearing certain costumes could have on their peers and on the sense of community here on campus. Notice that Ryan did not say in his column that the email forbade students from wearing racist or otherwise offensive costumes, but rather encouraged them to consider the marginalizing effect of their choices on other students. That's all. There was no policy that said, You can't wear your racist costume. It's just encouraging people to consider the effects of their actions. Jason and I invite our opponents to present us more than a handful of written, institutional policies  where it's been put in writing that you can't say certain things. You can't wear certain costumes. Sure, students would be encouraged to do or not do something. But I, as a higher education scholar who studied thousands of colleges and universities, have never seen a written institutional policy. Ryan goes on to say in his column, and I quote, Many welcomed the email, glad that Yale administrators were acknowledging the need for sensitivity. To many students, including myself, he says, the email meant that the voices of minority and marginalized students were finally being heard end quote. Ryan, like the now thousands of students of color who participated in my center’s campus climate studies was not attempting to shut down conversation. Instead, he wanted the voices of marginalized students like his  like himself, to finally be heard. When a person of color says that What you just said to me sounded or felt racist, we're not attempting to shut down the conversation. In fact, it's exactly the opposite. We are inviting you to engage with us. We're inviting you to learn, right? I mean, it is a university after all. Should this not be the place where one learns that thing that all Muslims are terrorists and all Mexicans are rapists is extremely problematic? Surely, John and Wendy do not believe that we should send college educated persons into the world without some understanding of how their speech and actions might unknowingly harm others."

    "data": "So, thanks very much . A philosopher and a social scientist are about to debate two scientists. And I invite you to look and think about the different ways that we approach this than the way they will . I'm going to take a sociological and psychological perspective . And my esteemed colleague, Ian, will take a philosophical perspective . It's hard in seven minutes to cover this kind of question and say why it is that I think the pursuit of immortality is a wrongheaded idea, or as Ian has coined it, Indefinitely long life. And I invite you to think about that acronym . I'm all for healthy aging . And I'm all for what we call biogerontology . To make ourselves more healthy and to make our lives more productive . First, before we continue, there's one important clarification . And this gets conflated a lot . And if we conflate it, we'll get nowhere . Life expectancy has increased, almost doubled . Lifespan has not. All right? People lived into their 90s and even into their hundreds for centuries. Nobody has lived to 130, as far as we know. But lots of people hav e lived to 100, 105, 110. And that's our lifespan . It seems to be programmed into us that we can't live any longer than that. So, let's not conflate life expectancy  which has increased  and lifespan, which has not. We all want to live longer. May be even forever. But I think the quest for immortality is a kind of narcissistic fantasy . It's about us. It's about me . It's not about what's good for society . It's not about what's good for everybody . It's what I want for myself . And there's a certain adolescent nature to it . Who thinks they're going to live forever? Who thinks of themselves as immortal? It's when we're young. And as we get older, we get a certain kind of wisdom, I think, that mitigates against that . The goal of anti aging is not to lengthen days, but to actually conquer death. It's part of a larger scientific, technological utopianism  very post humanist in its presentation  that has this kind of idealized view of how technology is going to change the basic nature of the human condition. It's a modern utopian fantasy . And it's not about whether it's possible . It's about whether it's desirable . And if we just put enough time and energy into our technology, we can have a kind of perfect world on Earth. It h as no connection to the live reality, in my view, of being a human being . And in fact, I think of it as rather dystopian. Why? For millennia, we've tried to solve the problems of poverty, of war, famine, nationalism. We still have all of these problems. We haven't conquered them . Technology hasn't conquered them . We always think the solutions are right around the corner. But suddenly, if we get to live to be 200 or 300, somehow, things will be better . Things won't be better . I don't believe. Not for us. Not for society, and where should we put our energy? So I am not up here to argue that lifespans are long enough. And I think the question is phrased wrong . What I want to argue is the pursuit of indefinitely long life, to make that a goal in and of itself is wrong headed . Will life extension make the world a better place, a kinder place ? Has extended  has life expectancy increase made it better ? I don't think so. I've never heard a single argument from the other side about how t his would benefit society ever because I don't think there is a plausible one . It would benefit me to live for a very long time. It has all kinds of problems when you think of it as a social expectation. It's a deep desire of individuals . But, as John said, the life expectancy has doubled. Does that mean that now we respect our elders and we have so many more older people that we turn to them for wisdom? No. Almost exactly tracking life expectancy increase has been a fetishization of yout h in the West, a youth culture. And we haven't become more attentive to the wisdom of all these old people we have produced, and there's no reason to think if they were 200 or 500 that we would be any more attentive to them either, not to mention the fact that it has been shown over and over again that as people get older they get more conservative and that youth come in with new ideas and new innovations. And there is a wisdom to the evolutionary process of letting the older generation disappear . If the World War I generation and World War II generation and perhaps, you know, the Civil War generation were still alive, do you really think that we would have civil rights in this country, gay marriage? That's a generational shift that happens o ver time. We would be obliterating generational shift and inculcating a deep kind of conservatism . I think we underestimate the cost, as Bob was saying . Look at Japan . Overpopulation is one possibility, over resource utilization, disruption of work . You know, we work for 50, 60, 70 years and then we're tired . We're still going to be tired if we live to be 200 . So the idea that if we live to be 200 we'll work for 150 years and then retire just makes no sense to me . You want to be a longshoreman for 1 50 years? I don't think so . It's more strain on social services . There's this idea that we're going to be perfectly healthy and live to 200 or 300 and, I don't know, get hit by a bus or something. B ut I'm just not sure that the lived experience of being human maps with the kind of utopian vision that we hear about this . There are already generational tensions. They're just going to get worse. Prolonged life will also help the older people accrue greater wealth . It will actually contribute to, I think , inequality . So I want to end by suggesting that this is a fantasy we all have. It's something we all want to some degree . But when you actually go deep to the social desirability of it, what its impact is going to be for us as societies, it's not going to be something we want . We already have older people who are retired who spend their days nonproductively . I was just talking to someone beforehand about his mother and my mother, who live really waiting for the time that it's over . Their spouses are dead . Their attachment to life has diminished . That's why Ezekiel Emanuel wrote in the New York Times that he is not going to want to live past age 75 and he will stop all medication at that time."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you . I'm glad to see such a large audience for this debate . I know that it's been a passion for me since a long  for a long time now . I think really, you know, it's the most important question facing humanity . I believe that the defeat of aging is the most important challenge facing humanity. And I'm pleased to see that the people of New York seem to agree. So I have of course prepared some remarks, but of course I also want to respond to some of the things that Paul just said. I'm going to talk about the question whether there is really a dichotomy between the individual benefit and the societal benefit of the extension of life. I'm also going to talk a little bit about the question of why longevity has increased when measured in terms of life expectancy, but not in terms of maximum longevity, which Paul called lifespan . And I think I'll also talk about the difference between health span and lifespan and why that difference is often raised as a kind of straw man with regards to this whole question. So I'm going to start with this question about the alleged conflict  tension  between the individual desire and societal good . Hands up anyone who wants to get Alzheimer's disease . All right. Hands up anyone who wants anyone else to get Alzheimer's disease . Right. Think about that, right? It's a societal good because we don't like each other to get sick any more than we want to get sick. And I say Alzheimer's disease just because it's an easy thing to point out, but I'm not trying to pull the wool over your eyes here either, because from a biology perspective it is incorrect, though very popular, to think that aging itself is something completely distinct from the diseases of old age like Alzheimer's or most cancers and so on . Most people kind of have this vision of aging as this mysterious nebulous, nonspecific phenomenon of the things that we don't call diseases . You know, things like loss of muscle mass and declining function of the immune system . And they don't think of those as somehow connected to the diseases of old age . And that gives overoptimistic impressions of what medical research is like , of the kind that is mostly done today is likely to achieve . Most people seem to think that there is some chance of curing Alzheimer's disease in the same way that we might cure the common cold, and not have any effect on agin g itself, whatever the hell that is. This is a mistake . Once you realize it's a mistake, one thing that arises very easily is the understanding that there is no danger whatsoever of extending longevity to any significant extent other than by extending healthy life . In other words, postponing rather than stretching the period at the end of life when we are not well and when we are going downhill. It's absolutely vital to bear that in mind at all times . But coming to the societal questions, there is another feature of this debate which Paul indeed touched on that I want to address . It's extraordinarily seductive , so  in my experience, for people to look at the question of some big change that might happen as a result of some technological progress and to presume that nothing else changes . So to look, for example, the world of it might be a hundred years from now when we had aging under complete medical control for, let's say 70 years for the sake of argument , and to presume that everyone would still have jobs and so there would be some kind of problem of, you know, what would people do and how would we make sure that the chronologically eldest people didn't have a disproportionate amount of income and disproportionate amount of capital. And people just kind of forget that hello, we've got artificial intelligence, which is going to be the focus of another debate that's coming up in a few weeks from now and the increase of automation, which is going to completely transform what it means to have a career at all. These things have to be taken into account when you consider the societal impact of some other major technological advance, such as the medical control of aging. And this very rarely happens, which annoys the hell out of me . So, I mean, here's the thing . If we are talking about increasing the amount of time that people stay healthy and not increasing the amount of time that people are sick at the end of life. And if we are talking about this happening in a gradual way, which of course it will because people only get older one year per year, you know, if that's what we're talking about, then we're talking about a situation which society has the opportunity to look at these questions, to adjust its priorities, which is at the level of just like prioritizing more education or taxing people differently or whatever . If it changes priorities so as to avoid any of the problems that might occur, you know, that might be created as a result of solving the problem we have today, the problem of age related ill health . So, I mean, we have to ask ourselves, why are we scared of this ? A simple way to put it is to say well, look, even in the worst case scenario where some  for some reason we can't figure out how to, you know, distribute what the  access to these therapies equally or how to stop dictators from living forever or whatever it might be. Supposing this happened, h ow bad a problem would that be and how bad a problem do we have today ? And, again, I am posing this question both at the individual level and at the societal level. And I believe that there is absolutely no way to make the case that there is the faintest possibility of problems being created that are anywhere near as cataclysmically horrifying at the problem we have today . Let me tell you exactly how bad the problem that we have today actually is . Worldwide roughly 150, 160,000 people die each day, all right ? And more than two thirds of those people die of aging. They die of aspect of ill health that predominantly affect people who were born a long time ago . So, in other words, they die of aging, more than two thirds . In fact, that proportion has gone up a lot. When I first tried to do these statistics, it was about two thirds, and that was 10 years ago . It's now more than 70 percent and still rising rapidly. It's crazy. In the industrialized world, of course we're talking more like 90 percent of all death. Let's actually do something about it . So, in conclusion, I would say I oppose the motion and I invite you to oppose it, too, because it is in your interest both individually and collectively . Thank you."

    "data": "The interesting question here and the real question is , Are lifespans ever long enough? I'm here to try and persuade you that if we answer that question as human beings , and that question is about human beings, the answer must be yes . What is an indefinitely long life ? Well, it's a life which , from the point of view of its owner , can be led with no thought as to its ending or decline . Our opponents think, one, we would all rationally choose such a life . Two, we all have the right to have this choice fulfilled . Three, as you've just heard, this right trumps everything else including the issues that affect our societies and our species, humanity . This reasoning is, first, based on an error, second, depends upon an impoverished conception of morality and what matters and, third, ultimately amounts to our rejection of the human. Why the error? Look, we all want to live . We always want to live . They think it was from that that we want to live always . This is invalid. There are some goods which we might  we might say we want more of, but they are in fact intrinsically finite . I might say, I don't want this movie I'm enjoying to end and I'm really sad when the credits roll. But that doesn't mean I want to see movies that never have endings  and therefore no middles or beginnings for then they wouldn't be movies . What we actually want when we say we always want to live is more of this life, at least more of the good things about this life in our world in which this kind of life still has meaning and value. And how does our life get meaning and value because this human life is one shaped from the inside start to end, top to bottom, by the facts of growth and development, our experiences and choices, and our relationships with others and their life stories and our place amongst the generations and the human story . We should not assume that a life unstructured by those facts is just more of our current life, a recognizably human life . It is not. Think of a decision like, Maybe it's time I settle d down and made a commitment to this career or this person or this place. What makes that a choice in the economy of human motivation and evaluation and decision are the opportunity costs. Well, these opportunity costs are priced in the currency of our most precious resource  time . You might think, Ah, wouldn't it be wonderful if I had an indefinite amount of that precious resource? But spending that precious currency is, in reality, the price of being a particular person. Being this kind of person rather than that. We become particular people by making those choices . So, to say we address the most profound problem of life by abolishing death is like saying, we'll solve world poverty by abolishing money . By contrast, actual human liv es, in all their glorious particularity, the indefinitely long life is the life indefinite . To embrace it, we'd have to rethink why we value what we do. For example, since few occupations are indefinitely satisfying, we'll need to live life with our finger on the soft reset button. Burned out as a teacher ? Ah, retrain as a neurosurgeon. Got bored with that ? Great . We need more people in sales . You can start in the mailroom. How many of us really want to start all over again from the bottom like that ? And do we really think that , if only we live long enough, we could all be neurosurgeons . To say otherwise is not to deny human potentiality . It's to recognize that with natural capacities come natural limitations . Fueling a fantasy here is the idea that what we really are are just things called disembodied minds, that we can kind of liberate from our biology and from the past. Our opponents are keen to point out that the human condition is biology all the way down . Hey, it's also biology all the way up. For it's not just our bodies that age. It is we who age . It is we who acquire memories and experiences, characters, and capacities . Natural gifts and natural limits . So maybe I have to get reset altogether. I get set back to kind of factory defaults . I get whole  lose my experiences, my capacities, my memories, have new ones . But hang on a minute. Wasn't it supposed to be me with the indefinitely long life ? What's the difference between this factory reset guy being me and it being just someone ? So, the opposition seems to require two things  that enough occupations are indefinitely satisfying. So, they all want to flip burgers for 300 years ? No . Or that human beings are indefinitely malleable, that they are something other than particular people . So I think this indefinitely long life is unrecognizable as a human life , as a particular life, as my life. And our opponents, having argued invalidly from the thought that we al ways want to live, so we want to live always, compound this error by saying that choice overrides absolutely . So, believing we have a right to an indefinitely long life amounts to believing we have the right to be other than human. That's why they embrace posthumanism, or trans humanism . Now sure, you can embrace that . You can think that, you know, being human sucks, especially the dying bit. And we better to be a cyborg, or a computer program, or an elf . But the thing is, you can't rationally want to be any of those things . You can want there to be elves, or cyborgs, or computer programs, but none of those can be you. So if you vote this evening, vote as humans, vote for humans, vote for the motion. Thank you."

    "data": "So, thank you for having me . It's a wonderful debate. And I'm going to try to use my time to get back to a little bit more pragmatism. We've heard a lot of speculation from the three speakers already about what's life going to be like when we live to 150 . How society is going to change . Maybe we'll get bored. I don't know what those answers are . I don't think any of us do . I do think technology is going to change dramatically over that time period . But I think there's a more immediate problem to deal with . And that's the one I want to tell you about. And when you ask me the question, Should people live longer? my answer is, It depends. You know, if I'm 80 years old and I'm having trouble getting out of bed and I'm taking 20 pills a day and I'm in pain all the time and I can't get out of the house, then maybe I don't want to live longer . Maybe I don't want to go through that period of decline . If I'm 80 years old and I'm healthy and I can go to the golf course, if I can go to work, if I can raise my grandkids and be with them, then I think my answer's going to be, I want to be healthy a lot longer . I want to be alive a lot longer. And so I think that the question of lifespan is really not the question. The question is health span. So let's think a little bit more about what health span  means. So I would define that as the period of time when you're disease  free, mostly at least, and when you're still highly functional. And you can compare the statistics on what's happening to lifespan versus what's happening to health span. Lifespan's going up . It's been going up pretty steadily over the last two centuries . Over the last 20 years  it kind of depends on what gender you are and where you're from but essentially lifespan is going up about one year in every four . So you're getting about a 25 percent return on investment. For every four years you live, you can live one year longer. But we have a problem . And the problem is healthy life expectancy is not going up at anywhere near the same rate . So the current approach we're taking is to keep you alive longer but to keep you sick longer. And that's what's failing . And if you look at the health care system, we're spending 19 percent of our GDP on health care . And most of that is spent in the last six months of a person's life. And what are we doing ? We're focusing on treatment and not prevention. We're trying to wait till you get sick and then spend a fortune treating you and trying to make you better . And if you look at the chronic diseases of aging, we're being very ineffective at that. The two places where we're having effects are diabetes and cardiovascular disease. And one of the major reasons why is we've defined risk factors for these diseases . Cholesterol is a 3.5fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease . High glucose is a risk of diabetes . And so when we define those risks and identify them to that person, we start treating it before they have the fullblown disease . We give them drugs . They have reduced cholesterol, reduced glucose . That's called, early stage prevention of disease, and it's very effective. Well, I've got news . Aging is the biggest risk factor for all of these diseases. It's the biggest risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it's far higher than cholesterol, for diabetes, for most forms of cancer, for all the neurodegenerative syndromes you're scared of, like Alzheimer's, macular degeneration, cataracts  I can go on . And so what I'm saying is, let's look at this common risk factor and target that . And if we do that, we're going to be effective at preventing multiple chronic diseases simultaneously and keeping you healthy. I don't see that as very different than targeting one disease at a time . All we're doing is taking the thing that's in common with all of these diseases and trying to target that as a means to effectively prevent all of them or as many as possible. The good news is we can already do this in animals . We can give a drug to a mouse and it lives 30 percent longer. And not only does it live longer, it's healthy longer, it's functional longer, it's protected from cancer, it's protected from neuro degeneration and a range of other diseases. It doesn't delay  it delays disease, it doesn't prevent it. The animal still gets sick, but it compresses their morbidity . They're sick for a less period of time before they die, already achievable in animals . Let's go back a minute and also talk about the demographics. And I'm going to try to make this case for how slowing aging would benefit society because we need to look at what's going on now in the first half of the 21st century. We're going to lo ok back at this and we're going to call it the  Age Age, because that's what happening  that's what's happening . We have more older people on the planet now than ever before, and the numbers are staggering . 25 percent of people in 2050 are going to be over the age of 60 . You've already heard about Japan, 40 percent of the people are over the age of 65 . And they have a crisis because there's not enough workers, so worker shortages, health care costs going through the roofs . This is a problem, and people have defined it . They've called it the silver tsunami. So, you know, it's not a question of What are we going to do if we keep you healthy and you retire and you have nothing to do? You're going to be working longer. And I think it's important that we think about ways to keep you healthy . If we do that, if we can make health span go up as fast as lifespan, people will continue to be productive . They'll continue to be active. They'll be  have much less health care costs . We'll improve quality of life, and in this first half of the 21st century we're going to dramatically improve the economic structure of society . So I think immortality's interesting. I think it's a great debate to talk about. I have my thoughts on it . I can share them later. But I think that gets away from the main challenge we have right now, which is what to do about this aging population and how do we treat or prevent al l of these chronic diseases that are having a staggering impact on society . You all know somebody that has Alzheimer's disease . It's terrifying. And I think that we can actually prevent this . I think that it's a little bit like  aging research is essentially prevention . It's like a car . It's doing the maintenance on the car to keep it working so that it breaks down later and that's what extending health span is . I think it's entirely possible if we put the effort into it . So, you know, we've heard about what's going to happen when we're 150 . Maybe we're going to be bored. Well, you know, if you ask me do I want to have cancer at 75 ? Do I want to have Alzheimer's disease at 85 ? Or do I want to be bored at 110 ? I know which one I'm going to take . So, I'm happy to have this debate . Thank you for coming ."

    "data": "Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank Intelligence Squared for bringing us together tonight and I want to thank you and our opponents for coming here tonight to debate this vital topic. Our case for the motion rests on three pillars: that admitting 100,000 Syrian refugees to the United States is the right thing to do, that it's a practical thing to do, and that it's a smart thing to do. It's the right thing to do not just because these are people in great need, but because the history of this country speaks to refugee resettlement as a core part of the American story. It will also transform obviously 100,000 lives and bring wider benefits to the U.S. Secondly, we will argue that it's a practical thing to do, because the U.S. has a proven, secure and effective system for refugee resettlement  far, far better than the chaotic scenes you see in Europe at the moment. We will show tonight that there is no parallel between the boat loads of people arriving in Europe and the pipeline of admissions that exist in the United States. And the third thing is that we will show you it's a smart thing to do to support this motion, because the last thing that ISIS and other hatemongers around the world want is for the U.S. to be a beacon of hope and inclusion and a beacon of tolerance for the world. The battle against extremism is fought not just by bombs and special forces. It's a battle of ideas and it's a battle of examples. And our greatest weapon is the living reality of communities that show how to cross boundaries of race, religion, and color. Support the motion and you will do what is right, what is practical, and what is smart. I want to explain how Ambassador Ford and I are going to share the work tonight. The International Rescue Committee has 2,000 staff working inside Syria today. We have 1,500 staff in the neighboring states of Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, and Turkey. We also have 400 staff now in Greece, welcoming refugees as they come off the boats. And we also have 800 staff in 26 U.S. cities organizing refugee resettlement. Because of that, I'm going to use my opening statement to explain why refugee resettlement is a core part of a comprehensive approach to the Syrian catastrophe. And then we have the genuinely unique advantage of Ambassador Ford using all of his insight into the Middle East to show why significant refugee resettlement is secure, how refugees are the most vetted population to arrive in the United States, and also how refugee resettlement is an important part of the battle against ISIS. Now, the Syria war shows few signs of ending. And the refugees desperately need help. Most of them are in the Middle East. And that's where most of the help is going. But for a minority, refugee resettlement is an essential part of the response. Let me explain why. Refugee resettlement in richer countries, safer countries, offers unique benefits. For those who are most vulnerable, for the kids with autism, for the people who have had their limbs blown off by barrel bombs, the care that is on offer in countries like this has no parallel. Secondly, and importantly, resettlement is essential, because countries like Lebanon and Jordan simply cannot cope with the millions of refugees that they have. Jordan is your second closest ally in the Middle East. It's a country of six million people. It has 650,000 refugees. That is like the whole of Poland coming to America in the space of four years. They're dealing with it alone at the moment. And thirdly, resettlement is needed now, because an organized, legal route to hope in the U.S., as well as in Canada and Australia, will disempower the smugglers who are currently charging 1,200 euros for desperate people to get the six kilometers from Turkey to Greece. Now, no one is saying that the majority of Syrian refugees will end up coming to the U.S. No one is saying that refugee resettlement is an alternative to aid in the Middle East or will bring the war to the end. But resettlement of 100,000 refugees is important. And for goodness sake, if Australia can take 18,000, if Canada can take 25,000, if France can take 35,000, then the United States, 10 times the size of Canada, can take 100,000 refugees. I can say this as a foreigner in this country who's working here. The U.S. has shown the world how to make refugee resettlement work. Get the kids into school. Teach the parents English. Get them a job. Get them on the path to citizenship. And you have patriotic and productive citizens. Don't just ask me. Ask Madeline Albright. Ask the founders of great companies around the country. Ask Elie Wiesel. Ask them and think of the contribution that they've made to the United States. The direct federal cost of services and benefits associated with resettling 100,000 refugees in this country  let me tell you what it is. It's 1.4 cents per American per day. That's the direct federal cost of services and benefits. It's true that that doesn't include health care costs or school costs. But nor does it include the taxes that Syrians pay when they work. And let me give you figures from my organization. 415 Syrians resettled by the IRC. Our services show that last year, 8 out of 10 Syrians who we resettled were in work within six months of getting to the United States. And there's one other unique resource of this country: SyrianAmerican communities across the country who are successful. The business people in San Diego, the doctors in Cleveland, the shopkeepers in New York  there are SyrianAmerican communities ready to welcome and integrate more Syrians who come here. Our opponents will ask you tonight to shatter the American dream for 100,000 people in desperate need of hope. And we ask you to keep that dream alive. These people are sitting in Beirut, and they're sitting in Amman, and they're sitting in Istanbul. And they're asking themselves a simple question: Does America stand for anything anymore? We say it does. The motion affirms America's historic contribution to a world defined by respect, not retribution. And ask yourself: Do a limited number of Syrian refugees need help and a fresh start in life? We say, Yes. Has America got a good record of making a success of refugee resettlement? We say, Yes. And doesn't the battle against extremism require our countries to set an example of inclusion and integration? We say the answer to all these questions is a resounding Yes. we don't say the policies are easy. They're not. They're not simple or easy. But they are clear. We urge you to support the motion with your head and your heart. Thank you very much indeed."

    "data": "Tonight, we debate how to respond to one of the most terrible humanitarian disasters of the postCold War era  perhaps the very most terrible disaster of them all. Human beings are at risk, are suffering, are dying, have died. As we convene tonight, the forces of Hezbollah and the Assad Regime are deliberately starving thousands of besieged people in the town of Madaya. All sides of this debate take these grim issues deeply and seriously to heart. What is to be done? At the time when this debate topic was proposed, in October, President Obama was mocking concerns about the Syrian refugees as fear of widows and orphans. Since then have come the coordinated mass sexual assaults by migrants and refugees in Cologne and other German cities. This past weekend, three Syrian refugees were arrested in Munich for attacking two German girls at a public school, raping one. The victims of sexual abuse by refugees and migrants in Germany, and Austria, and Sweden  since the turn of the year  now number nearly 1,000. The giddy mood of the fall has faded. Almost twothirds of Germans say their country has accepted too many refugees. And here in the United States, too, a new sobriety about Syrian refugees is taking hold. Jessica and I welcome tonight's debate as a step toward this new sobriety. Here's our plan for tonight. I will open by arguing that mass resettlement of refugees in the Middle East is not in the American interest. When I say mass, I mean mass. Clearly, there are individuals and families who need to be in the West, who have family connections, who belong to the small but real former Syrian urban elite. Many of them have actually already resettled themselves with friends and family here in the West. That is not who we are talking about tonight. Tonight we are talking about what is to be done with the very, very large numbers of Syrian refugees who do not have prior connections to the West, who are not  who have no family, who are not connected to people here, and who lack the aptitudes and skills that would normally qualify them for the usual immigration processes. Jessica will then continue the argument by demonstrating that mass resettlement isn't in the refugees' interests either, for one simple economic reason. It costs about 13 times as much to resettle one refugee family in the United States as it does to resettle them closer to home. We hope, tonight, that we can reason together. Yet, there are people  not our opponents  distinguished men of great accomplishment. But there are people urging mass resettlement of refugees to the West, who relied heavily on bullying and namecalling to make their case. Those who don't agree are cowards, or racists, or worse. The memory of the victims of the Nazi Holocaust has been invoked to justify policy that actually puts at even greater risk than already is the case the desperately imperiled last Jewish communities of Europe. When Jessica and I speak to your reason and judgment, it is not because we lack compassion for those in danger and need. We'll show you policy alternatives for the crisis in Syria that meet every call of conscience. But policy must not be  policy that is supported by untruths, by concealments, and epithets is no compassion at all. So, here are some truths. Despite the posters that remind us that Albert Einstein was once a refugee, the social, economic, and cultural gap between the global South and the global North, between the Middle East and the Middle West, is extremely wide and very difficult to cross. Before the Syrian Civil War began in 2010, the average Syrian had less than six years of formal schooling  less even than Egypt, according to the  less even than in Egypt, according to the U.N. Development Index. About onefifth of Syrians made their living as agricultural laborers. Women were harshly subordinated. Only about 13 percent of Syrian women worked outside the home, and their literacy levels were significantly lower than those of men. Prewar Syria was a tribal society characterized by lawlessness, high levels of religious fundamentalism, and deep, deep sectarian animosities. It's often suggested that because the Syrian population has been caught in the crossfire between ISIS and the Assad Regime, that, that population must, therefore, be unsympathetic to radical Islam. But rejecting ISIS, the demented and murderous ideology of ISIS, is not the same thing as accepting liberal democracy or the equality of women and gays or coexistence with Christians and Jews. We've seen in the reception centers of Germany that SyrianSunni Muslim refugees have violently attacked Christians, the Yazidis, and people they perceive as gay. The New York Times reported on January 2nd on the brutal abuse of Syrian refugee women by their husbands and family members, including the unwillingness of many refugee men to allow their wives to attend classes unsupervised or even to go out once a week for a walk in an allfemale group. We may be told that migrants to the United States will be screened more carefully than the noquestionsasked approach taken in Germany and across Europe. As Jessica will show in her remarks, this talk is empty. But what needs to be stressed even more is that screening is impossible. Radicalization is increasingly something that happens in the West among the second generation of Middle Eastern migrants, those who will be born here. It was people born in the West who carried out the Paris massacres, who murdered the editorial staff at Charlie Hebdo, and the shoppers at Paris's Kosher Hyper Cacher, who shot up the Brussels Jewish Community Center and a Jewish School in Toulouse. It was a man born in Chicago, Illinois, who committed mass slaughter in San Bernardino. To date, the United States has suffered far less from this internal self radicalization than Europe has suffered. Americans owe their greater security to a very practical fact. While the United States has experienced a large surge of lowskilled migration from countries in this hemisphere, its migration from the greater Middle East has been more carefully selected. Migrants who bring with them the skills and values that lead to success in the United States are likely to raise successful and wellintegrated children. Those who don't, won't. We have a very relevant precedent for what's proposed with the Syrians, America's experience with Somalian refugees. Since 1990, the United States has admitted the same  about the same round number of Somalian refugees that is proposed for Syria tonight, about 100,000 people. A quarter century onward, unemployment amongst Somali Americans exceeds 20 percent, and the second largest Somali community in the country, in the state of Maine, half the men never worked at all in the five years before the Great Recession started. Almost all Somali Americans, to this day, receive some form of cash or food assistance."

    "data": "John, thank you very much. And thank you, all, for attending. Syria is a huge human tragedy. I think it's worth remembering this little statistic, which I came across yesterday when I was doing some reading, the Syrian conflict, which has been going on now for four years, has affected more people than Hurricane Katrina, the Indian Ocean tsunami, and the Haitian earthquake, combined. This is not a normal situation. This is not a normal situation. And in an abnormal situation, people look to the United States. That's what global leadership is about. We are special that way. And I have to tell you, having served as an American ambassador in Algeria and having served as an American ambassador in Syria, it's a huge honor to represent a country that is known for its humanistic values and is known for its willingness to make hard decisions and to lead. And so what David and I are asking tonight of you, as you think about this motion, is not to let your fear dominate, but rather to let both your reason and your hearts dominate. I want to say a few things about security since David raised some of the issues that have come up in Germany. Yes, there have been problems in Germany. We can discuss that in greater detail, David, if you'd like. The process by which people are brought into the United States is completely different from what's going on in Germany and other countries in Europe. It is a very orderly process. Is it perfect? No. No human endeavor is perfect, but it's quite, quite good. How many of you have seen a terrorist incident by a refugee here in the United States? Anybody seen one? 785,000 refugees, 115,000, more than 115,000, Iraqi refugees have come into the United States. Has anybody seen any of them commit a mass shooting? Terrorist incident at a mall? No. There have been some Iraqis arrested for terrorism, that is true. I think the latest number, given events last week, is five out of roughly 115,000. That is actually a small number and in each of these cases federal authorities were able to intervene before they did any damage. By the way, out of those five arrested, three of them were arrested for activities outside the United States that were not targeted at Americans. So I ask you to sort of put in relative context the security risk, but I want to add also what U.S. government agencies do to help bring that risk down. I won't go into all of the detail now, although I would be delighted if David and Jessica want to do that. I would just say this. The process of screening is very long. It takes 18 to 24 months for the average Syrian refugee to get through the security screening process. Multiple U.S. government intelligence agencies, including the CIA, the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI, the Defense Department, the State Department, and other intelligence agencies are involved in building a dossier for each refugee case. Let me say that again. Each refugee case has an intelligence community driven dossier. That's why it takes 18 to 24 months. So we can bring them in with an assurance of very good safety, and the record shows that. The record shows that safety. Now I want to talk also because I was in the Middle East, yesterday I was in front of the Congress talking about the Islamic State and our efforts to battle and to eliminate the Islamic State. I want you to understand that the Islamic State wants the Americans to reject refugees from Syria. The Islamic State wants the United States to say we don't want Syrian refugees. We don't want Muslims coming to the United States. The Islamic State wants to paint this as a battle between the Christian West and the Muslim world. That helps their recruitment. That helps their recruitment. It's not an accident that a terrorist organization with links to alQaeda and the Islamic State in Somalia called AlShabaab put a Donald Trump spot in some of their online recruitment materials. It helps them recruit. And so as we think about how to pursue the battle against the Islamic State, which involves military operations, diplomatic efforts to build a coalition, efforts to cut off their finances and other things, our policy on refugees must fit into that broader policy context. Otherwise, our right hand is undermining what our military diplomatic treasury departmentled financial efforts are doing. We don't want that. We don't want that. Finally, I just want to conclude with one remark about what David said. I lived in Syria for a bit over a year and I visited it as a tourist several times. I never saw that Syria was lawless. I never saw that Syria was particularly tribal. Most Syrians are not tribal because they live in big cities. Damascus, Homs  they did before the conflict. They're big cities, very urban. And they're exceptionally sophisticated. And in fact, if you look at the Syrian immigrant population here in the United States, the SyrianAmerican communities here in the United States, you will see that as well. Doctors, business owners  here in New York City, many, many SyrianAmericanowned businesses. It is an urbane culture. It is not a lawless culture. And it is most certainly not a radical Islamic culture. Definitely not. And so, again, I ask you to think about the security, think about the safety, think about our values. And vote for the motion. Thank you so much."

    "data": "Thank you. And thank you, John. So, David very eloquently outlined the big picture around  surrounding the reasons why we are opposed to this motion to bring in 100,000 Syrian refugees. And I'm going to fill that in with some details. This motion is irresponsible in the extreme. I'm going to explain the two main reasons why 60 percent of the American public is opposed to this proposal and why you should be too. The main reason is that it's simply an enormous and unacceptable security risk to our country. It's also an enormous and unacceptable financial burden on the communities where these refugees will be placed, and on American taxpayers. 100,000 is a huge number. It's two times the current annual flow of refugees, two times the number that we've been bringing in in recent years. It's five times the number  annual number of Iraqis that we've been bringing it. It's so large and disproportionate to our agency's capacity to process them that one top State Department official, the woman who's in charge of managing the refugee program, said  and I'm quoting  The notion that we could get to 100,000 refugees from Syria just isn't possible. And it's not that it's a question of a will to do something or, you know, organizing logistics. The security situation today is really different from other times in our history. And this population of Syrians is really different from some of the other refugee populations that we admit. The main thing is that  I mean, we know that terror groups are trying to infiltrate the refugee flow. I'm willing to take them at their word. They've told us that. They're seeking to exploit it. It has  it's  we need to pay attention to what's happening in Europe, not just Paris and other  but other places. But these refugees have all  who were terrorists have already succeeded in in infiltrating our flow. There have been 15 instances, just since 2014, of either refugees who were terrorists, who were admitted, mistakenly. We didn't catch them. Or people admitted as refugees who later became terrorists. And this is not a small problem. Right now, the FBI has something like 900 ongoing investigations into people who are associated with ISIS. But there has been more than a dozen  probably more like 15 instances  of people who really were terrorists. They were training people to make bombs so that they could attack American soldiers. They had already attacked American soldiers overseas. It's real. It's a risk. And it's just not a couple of people. We've  when you hear these stories of actual terrorists who came in as actual refugees, and then we hear the president and his allies, who are pushing for this 100,000 Syrian refugees to be admitted  and talk about the 18 to 24month vetting period, which is really, you know, more of a waiting period than  no one spends 18 to 24 months investigating refugees. We hear that they have three interviews. We hear that they're fingerprinted. We hear that we check databases. The truth is that even our fabulous screening system, which is supposedly better than anyone else's in the world has made some mistakes before. And that's why  don't believe me  believe the Director of the FBI, who, with his top staff, has testified before Congress to say that it simply can't be done. We don't have the assets there to vet them against. As he says, we can check databases until the cows come home. But we have no information from the government, no one we know that we can talk to about these individuals. And we have to remember  these are  these refugees are chosen by U.N. employees who are hired locally. You heard it. We actually outsource the selection of refugees and the first two most important interviews to U.N. staff from the  this region. They're, I'm sure, great, hardworking people. But their mission is to help people, not to worry about what's going to happen once that refugee arrives in the United States. That job is done by our government officials. But they simply don't have the tools to do it. It's an impossible task. Now, even if we were able to overcome the very real security concerns and risks, and even if we were to find a machine that could read people's mind or, you know, see into the future whether or not they're going to become a terrorist, there's another huge reason to vote  to say no to this proposal, to admit 100,000 Syrian refugees. And that is the huge fiscal cost to taxpayers and to the communities where they're going to be placed. The U.N. has two options to help refugees. One is integration near where they are. And the other is resettlement. And resettlement is definitely the luxury option, for sure. 100,000 Syrian refugees, quite simply, will break the bank of many communities. My organization has added up the cost of  both the federal costs that David referred to  cash, housing assistance, job training, health care, language training, special education  but also the local costs. According to the federal government, 91 percent of refugees from the Middle East are on food stamps. 68 percent of them are qualifying for cash assistance. The total fiveyear cost for one Syrian refugee is going to be $64,000. That figure is, as David said, 12 times the cost of what the U.N. spends locally helping Syrians in Syria. And as is typical in these programs that cost money, the cost is going to be borne by the communities where people are  that are forced to absorb these individuals, not by the people who were talking the loudest and trying to push it on these communities. They're not going to Stanford, Connecticut and Short Hills, New Jersey. They're going to Springfield, Massachusetts, and Idaho, and Allentown, Pennsylvania, where there are lower costs of living. High unemployment. People already there who need services. Schools are already overwhelmed. Let's be clear. We have to acknowledge that our compassion has to be backed up by our wallets. And if we don't provide the problems that David  the services that they need, the problems that David so eloquently articulated are going to be something that we have to deal with in the future. And that's why the better, responsible thing to do is to say No to the proposal to bring in 100,000 Syrian refugees."

    "data": "Thank you and good evening. Roger and I thank Intelligence Squared for the opportunity to debate this violent  this  I'm sorry, not violent  this vital issue. We thank Professor Archer and Dean Chemerinsky for  in advance, for a respectful exchange. Now, in candor, we're not counting on persuading the two of you. But we are counting on persuading everyone else in the room. Roger, batting cleanup, will focus on how racial preferences violate the clear text and bedrock principles of the 14th Amendment, and how they have costs to constitutional values that far exceed any benefits. I focus on facts showing how the large racial preferences  very large  used by almost all selective universities in the country violate each of several equal protection rules laid down by the Supreme Court in its four racial preference and admissions precedents. The first of those rules  I'll read it  A raceconscious admissions program may not unduly harm members of any racial group. Our contention is that large racial preferences  and I emphasize large, because we're not talking about tiebreakers or balancetippers. We're talking about enormous differences in the average credentials of students of different racial groups entering universities and the costs those have. The first racial preference harm is obvious. Whites and Asians, who are excluded, are overlooked to admit less qualified members of raciallypreferred groups. They're harmed, clearly. And not enough so far to get the Supreme Court to say, You can't do this anymore. But they're harmed. Asian Americans in particular are the victims of systematic racial discrimination by just about all of the top universities in America. I think that's become fairly clear, although it's still disputed. And  but the most grievously harmed victims, we think, are the Hispanic and African American  especially, because they receive the largest racial preferences  supposed beneficiaries of racial preferences, who are misled by universities into thinking that they're going to do well academically when the universities know that on average, they're not going to do well because of their entering credentials. In fact, between 25 percent and 50 percent of African American students at our universities rank in the bottom 10th of their classes academically. This comes as a rude surprise to a lot of them, because that's not what they were led to expect. But the reason is obvious. The reason  use of very large racial preferences to bring into the universities the same racial gaps in academic accomplishment and preparation that people have when they exit high school is the reason for this. The average black 12th grader is about four years behind the average white 12th grader. Now, that's not true of everybody going to college, but it's some indication of how big the gaps are. Now, this sets black students in particular without warning to struggle and in many cases to fail, no matter how hard they work. There are, of course, excellent black students that do terrifically, but recipients of large racial preferences with some exceptions by and large have a very hard time no matter how hard they work. Most lose selfconfidence, become demoralized, avoid or drop out of the toughest courses, science, math, engineering, premed, courses that lead to some of the most desirable careers. And, therefore, as a result of racial preferences, I contend, and we contend in our book, Mismatch, my coauthor, Rick Sander, and I, we have fewer black and Hispanic lawyers, doctors, engineers, and scientists than we would if all universities had raceneutral admissions programs, because the people who are doing badly at universities where they are not well qualified would be doing well in universities where they're competitive. This pattern is called mismatch. Black law graduates fail the bar exam, for example, at four times the white rate. This is an enormous waste of their time, their money, and their ambitions. And if they were going to less prestigious law schools, they would be more likely to pass the bar exam. In fact, most recipients of racial preferences we contend would be better off, certainly academically, if they attended colleges for which they're well qualified. And, in fact, we think there's some evidence  this is pretty well disputed  that they might do better in their careers and they might have happier lives in that case. I'll try and give an example of that later. The universities' pervasive dishonesty about the size of racial preferences and about their academic effects on the supposed beneficiaries denies these people the opportunity to make informed decisions about where they want to go to college. At a minimum, there ought to be full disclosure of the size of racial preferences, which are a deeply dark secret among the universities. Second Supreme Court rule, I'll read this one, Universities must demonstrate, before they turn to racial preferences that race neutral alternatives do not suffice to provide adequate diversity. The Supreme Court has said that more or less verbatim. No university of which I know has ever made the slightest effort to explore raceneutral alternatives to racial preferences to promote diversity. Now, there's a very, very obvious race neutral alternative, which is class based recruitment and preferences for working class and poor students of all races. And there's a large supply of pretty strong academic students in that  in that category. Such class based preferences would add more diversity of background and of viewpoint than racial preferences do. But instead of trying classbased preferences, universities systematically prefer well off black and Hispanic students over less welloff white and Asian students who are better qualified academically. Think about that. The third Supreme Court equal protection rule holds that outright racial balancing is patently unconstitutional. And the facts on that are pretty brief. The information all over the country screams the conclusion that virtually all these universities are using outright racial balancing in the face of rough targets for how many students in each racial group, which they strive to meet."

    "data": "Good evening. It's such a pleasure to be with you. Every Supreme Court case to consider the issue has held that affirmative action by college universities is constitutional. The Supreme Court for decades has said that colleges and universities have a compelling interest in a diverse student body. The colleges and universities may use race as one factor among many to enhance diversity and benefit minorities. This has] had a tremendous beneficial effect. It's reduced the unfortunate legacy of racial discrimination in this country. It's enhanced the education of countless students. Tonight Professor Archer and I are arguing we should not abandon this policy that largely has worked so well. I am going to argue why affirmative action is consistent with the Equal Protection Clause. Professor Archer, in her time, will respond to the arguments that are made against affirmative action by Mr. Taylor and Mr. Clegg. I am going to make three points. First, affirmative action is consistent with the text and the history of the Equal Protection Clause. Second, affirmative action serves compelling purposes, especially diversity in college universities. And, third, there's no other way to achieve these goals, especially diversity, except through affirmative action. As to the first point, the Constitution says, No state shall deny any person equal protection of laws. Notice it doesn't say that everyone has to be treated the same. Long ago, Aristotle said, Equality means treating likes alike and unalikes unalike. To the extent that students are different, based on their history, based on what they bring to the campus, they must be treated differently. Notice it also doesn't say that the government must be colorblind. The 14th Amendment could've been written that way, but it wasn't. It is absurd to think of the government as always colorblind. If the police want to infiltrate a gang that's defined by race, surely they should be able to take that into account. Throughout American history, the Supreme Court has recognized that equal protection allows the government to take race into account. That's consistent with the history of the 14th Amendment. The very Congress that ratified the 14th Amendment adopted colorbased programs, things we call, affirmative action, today, like the Freedmen's Bureau. It's why the Supreme Court repeatedly has said, Colleges, universities can engage in affirmative action. My second point is that affirmative action serves compelling purposes, especially diversity. We cannot discuss affirmative action outside of the context of American history. Throughout American history, there have been separate and unequal schools based on race, and that's not a thing from long ago. Just a couple of decades ago, Harvard Professor Christopher Jencks found that an average 20 percent less is spent on an AfricanAmerican child's elementary and secondary school compared to a white child's elementary and secondary school. Today, about 90 percent of the students in private schools are white. The reality is that race matters enormously in how all of us experience society. College universities have long realized diversity matters. It's long been easy to get into Harvard or Yale if you're from Montana or North Dakota compared to if you're Boston or New York based. College universities have long accepted people who had relatives who went to that college or university. Legacies, I don't hear Mr. Taylor talking about the problem in mismatch for legacies. The reality is diversity matters, and racial diversity matters. Racial diversity helps to bring crossracial understanding. It breaks down stereotypes. It prepares students for the multicultural world in which they'll exist. That's why every Supreme Court case has found diversity to be a compelling interest. And my third point is there is no other way to achieve diversity except through affirmative action, no other way to achieve the goals that I've talked about except through this. This has been the experience in states that have tried to eliminate affirmative action. As I mentioned earlier, in California, after Proposition 209, there was a dramatic decrease in the presence of AfricanAmerican and Latino students, especially at UCLA Berkeley. There are still fewer AfricanAmerican students today at UCLA than there were prior to 1996. There are dramatically fewer AfricanAmerican and Latino students at Berkeley and UCLA law schools compared to Stanford and USC. But affirmative action programs work. Take the University of Texas program that's now before the Supreme Court. They look at race as one of many factors in admissions. In addition to grades and test scores and two letters of recommendation, race is just one of six factors, and yet doing that, together with taking the top 10 percent of high schools across the state, meant there was a 20 percent increase in AfricanAmerican students, a 15 percent increase in Latino students. Professor Archer will respond in detail to Mr. Taylor, but I want to disagree with a couple of things that he says. One thing that he says is they are against large racial preferences. I think all of us would be against large racial preferences, but that's not what you're asked to vote on tonight. In order to vote for the affirmative, you have to vote against all racial preferences, large or small, that's how the topic is written. He spent most of his time talking about his mismatch hypothesis. There's one problem with the mismatch theory. It's flat out wrong. The evidence doesn't support it. In fact, I'll quote to you from a brief that was recently filed in the Supreme Court by Richard Lempert a social scientist and professor at Michigan. He said, The overwhelming weight of the evidence suggests that affirmative action as currently practiced, does not harm minorities for academic mismatch, and may benefit students. If there's any mismatch problem it is that minorities are more likely to be in situations of under match. To vote for the affirmative tonight you must find one of two things. Either they must convince you that diversity is unimportant, disagreeing with the Supreme Court and almost every university in the country, or they must convince you that there is some other way to achieve diversity besides what we're discussing. No college or university has found it yet. Focusing on class doesn't do that because, although more percentage wise African American and Latinos are coming from disadvantages classes, the sheer number of white students who are disadvantaged greater. Focusing on class doesn't yield racial diversity. Nothing does. That's why you should continue the status quo and vote against the proposition."

    "data": "Thank you very much and thank you to Intelligence Squared for putting on this event. Let's begin by reading the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. No state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Note that it doesn't say anything about protecting some races differently from other races. It applies to all races. And, of course, any other interpretation would be inconsistent with equal protection of the laws, wouldn't it? It is also inconsistent with the necessary structure of a Constitution for We the People, the people that is increasingly multi racial and multiethnic. Now Erwin talked about how some kinds of discrimination are certainly okay. Colleges discriminate all the time on the basis of things like SAT scores and grades and so forth. But some kinds of discrimination are not okay under the Equal Protection Clause when you look at its historical context And the principle kind of discrimination that is not okay under the Equal Protection Clause is discrimination on the basis of race. It's true that the people who drafted the Equal Protection Clause had in the forefront of their minds protecting the rights of African Americans who had just been freed from slavery, but they deliberately chose words that were broader in protection than that. Words that protected whites, as well as blacks, from racial discrimination. And it would today protect Asian Americans from being treated less favorably because of their race than white Hispanics. And it's good that they did. It is after all the Constitution we are expounding, and it would be untenable to have a legal regime in 2015 that allowed the government to sort people according to skin color and what country their ancestors came from in our increasingly multiethnic and multiracial society. Bear in mind that our opponents interpret the Equal Protection Clause to permit racial discrimination against a racial minority, Asian Americans, in favor of white Hispanics. Now, it's sometimes said that the Constitution means what the Supreme Court says it means, and I don't buy that completely. But it's worth pointing out here that the basic approach the court has taken is the correct one, that all Americans are protected from racial discrimination and that exceptions to this rule will be allowed only in extraordinary circumstances when the government has a really, really, really, really good reason to discriminate, and no other way to accomplish this compelling end except through racial discrimination. If our opponents don't establish all four of those reallys, then they lose. It's as simple as that. So, do we have that in the case of racial preferences in state university admissions? We do not. And this is where the Supreme Court has gotten wrong  where I hope it will correct itself in the year ahead. What the Court has said and what our opponents are arguing tonight is that what some students say in random conversations in and outside campus classrooms might be so insightful, and so unlikely and difficult to be learned in any other way besides these random conversations, that it is worth denying admission to some white and Asian American students because of their race so that other white and Asian American students might hear these random observations. That's it. That is what universities are arguing. I don't think that that is compelling at all. But there's something else that you need to keep in mind tonight. Even if you think that there is something to that argument, you have to weigh against that purported benefit the costs of racial discrimination. Now, my partner  Stuart Taylor tonight, has already described one of the heaviest of those heaviest costs, namely the mismatch of students in universities. But there are a lot of other costs too. And in my remaining time, I'm going to run through them. Here they are. It's personally unfair, passes over better qualified students, and sets a disturbing legal, political, and moral precedent in allowing racial discrimination. It creates resentment. It stigmatizes the socalled beneficiaries in the eyes of their classmates, teachers, and themselves as well as future employers, clients, and patients. It fosters a victim mindset, removes the incentive for academic excellence. It encourages separatism. It compromises the academic mission of the university and lowers the overall academic quality of the student body. It creates pressure to discriminate in grading and graduation. It breeds hypocrisy within the school. It encourages a scofflaw attitude among college officials. It papers over the real social problem of why so many African Americans and Latinos are academically uncompetitive. As Stuart said, they typically emerge from K through 12 schools four years behind their white and Asian peers academically. That's a problem that should be addressed, but we are not  there's not the urgency to address it because of the existence of racial preferences. Another cost  perhaps most fundamental of all  it gets states, state governments, and their schools involved in unsavory activities like deciding which racial and ethnic minorities will be favored and which ones not  and how much blood is required to establish group membership? An untenable legal regime in America that is becoming increasingly multiracial and multiethnic. And where individual Americans are more and more likely themselves to be multiracial and multiethnic, starting with our president. I think that it is very hard to say that all of those costs are outweighed by anything that might be learned in a random campus conversation. Please vote against a pro preference interpretation of the Constitution and in favor of the motion tonight. Thank you."

    "data": "Good evening, everyone. My partner has explained the legal analysis that firmly establishes the constitutionality of affirmative action programs. Although there is a push to interpret the Equal Protection Clause in a way that ignores race and racial context, the very purpose of the 14th Amendment is to counter the oppression of historically subjugated racial minorities. You've also heard a laundry list of the alleged harm that affirmative action causes to black and Latino students. Those harms are not real. Affirmative action has offered a pathway to opportunity for generations of students of color. It has taken steps to diversify our campuses and has made for a more just America. The weight of the evidence demonstrates that affirmative action is good policy. But whatever you think of affirmative action as a matter of policy, that's not the question you're asked to address today. The question is whether or not affirmative action violates the Equal Protection Clause, and I urge you to vote against that motion. It bears repeating that the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that raceconscious admissions programs in public colleges and universities are constitutional with substantial, not trivial, substantial benefits that flow to the educational institution, the larger society, and individual students, both students of color and white students. Pursuing the educational value of a racially diverse student body is a compelling state interest. Arguing  arguments about whether extra points set aside substantial preferences, whether or not those are constitutional are all  they're all red herrings. The court has already held that universities cannot have specific racial targets, universities cannot set aside spots for students of certain racial backgrounds, and universities can't consider race in an inflexible manner. The Equal Protection Clause does allow universities to use race as one consideration when choosing among a group of qualified students, not all with identical qualifications, but all qualified. Numbers are not the only thing that matter, and higher SAT scores does not make you more qualified or more deserving of admission. Universities are trying to admit people, not SAT scores. And universities don't exist to credential the best test takers. I'm not saying that race is a qualification, not at all, but race is a part of who we are. The Equal Protection Clause permits colleges and universities to consider many characteristics, including sexual orientation, political persuasion, gender, whether or not you're from Ohio. We can't exclude race and only race from that list of considerations. We couldn't possibly offer each student individualized holistic review without giving some consideration to race, especially when an applicant has indicated that race is important to their own sense of self identity, their own sense of who they are. For that student who says their race is important, it's critical to understanding their achievements, their accomplishments, and their perspectives. Now, the statistics that have been cited by the proponents of this resolution about disparities and outcomes for students of color are indeed troubling. But every assertion that they make is contested, and none can be the basis of a constitutional rule. The methods and conclusions they've reached have been criticized and rejected by almost every social scientist who has examined the data. There have been many studies that have found no evidence, whatsoever, of mismatch. There are numerous studies that say affirmative action programs have unequivocally benefitted minority students and society. There are studies that say minority students fair far better, the higher ranked school that they attend, and, very importantly, there are studies that say the problem of under matching, where students with strong academic credentials attend lower ranked schools even though they could get accepted to higher ranked schools, is far more a problem for minority students than mismatches. Even if you were to accept the proponents' assertions as true, they do not undermine the conclusion that achieving racial diversity is a compelling government interest. Those statistics they cite are just a snapshot of a much larger story. They ignore the fact that race continues to structure the opportunities and outlook for all Americans. To assess the impact of race conscious admissions programs, we must first acknowledge the critical factors that contribute to any alleged black or Latino underperformance in the classroom. And those include racial discrimination. They include discrimination by professors. They include inadequate K12 education systems. They include stereotype threat. The gap between the performance of some minority students and some white students is quite troubling, but race conscious admissions programs are not the cause of those troubles. Finally, the argument that race conscious admissions programs should be outlawed because minority students end up attending schools that are academically too challenging for them quite frankly is condescending. It inappropriately seeks to displace the independent, informed judgment of minority students about the potential costs and benefits of attending flagship universities and colleges. We should want all of our students to aim high and challenge our  themselves. We shouldn't be settling for less for minority students. The individual harm  the individual harms that affirmative action's opponents claim will befall minority students have not come to pass. For example, you heard about minority students who will experience stigma, both internal and external, doubting their own qualifications and sense of belonging and having their classmates, and their faculty members doubt their abilities. There is no causal connection between race conscious admissions programs and racial stigma. It's never been established. The fact remains the root causes of racial stigma reach back much further than race conscious admissions programs. We all know that minority students faced stigma before affirmative action programs and they would continue to face stigma without affirmative action programs. In fact, those who argue that race conscious admissions programs should be banned because they stigmatize minority students are part of the problem. Stamping all minority students with badges of inferiority by assuming they lack qualifications is racial discrimination. The fact that there were will be racists who assume that every black person or Latino person that he or she sees is unqualified cannot dictate the reach or meaning of the Constitution. The motion asks you to assess the constitutionality of race conscious admissions programs, not whether affirmative action is good policy. But on either question, the proponents of this motion are wrong, and I urge you to vote against the motion."

    "data": "Thank you. In this debate, I'm going to expound the case for the motion, in favor of central banks being able to print prosperity. And then my colleague, Simon Johnson, is going to hone in on the two keywords in this motion. That's to say: can and prosperity. This is a debate about the merits of central banks printing money to escape from or prevent a monetary collapse. In the jargon, the name given to the policy is quantitative easing, or QE for short. Under this policy, to be clear, the central bank buys financial assets in the markets  usually bonds  with money that it itself creates, thereby increasing both its assets and its liabilities. In practice, usually, hardly any extra notes are actually printed. Rather, the money is created electronically. The extra money corresponds to extra deposits at the Central Bank. But since such deposits are freely interchangeable with notes, it's a  I think, a fair approximation to discuss and describe this policy as printing money. And that's the convention I'm going to accept. This policy sounds extraordinary, even exotic, hence the apparent whiff of danger, doubtless soon to be puffed up  by the team sitting opposite. But in fact, this policy has featured in the standard economic textbooks for generations. Some of you may have read those textbooks  looking around the room, some of you may even have written them  under the name open market operations. Moreover, this policy has been advocated by many great economists, including the great Milton Friedman, the arch proponent of monetarism. Mind you, let's be clear about this. Printing money is not the answer to a maiden's prayer. There are limits to what it can achieve. And it's not for all seasons. It will not improve your sex life or fix your gammy leg. More prosaically, it won't even raise the longterm sustainable rate of economic growth. We know the factors that are responsible for that determinant. That's to say, the real factors; hard work, investment, technological progress and organizational efficiency. But these allimportant real factors operate through a financial and monetary system. And every so often that financial and monetary system breaks down  sometimes in spectacular fashion. And when that happens, all these wonderful real things like hard work and technological progress and capital investment  all that stuff, there is nothing. They're swept away from the tsunami of monetary collapse. There are three examples of monetary collapse in recent history: the 1930s, pretty much everywhere throughout the industrial world, Japan from the early 1990s onwards, and the financial crisis of 2008/9. Let's concentrate, first of all, on the 1930s. In the Great Depression in the U.S. in the 1930s, let's recall  some of us remember  U.S. output fell by 30 percent. Unemployment rose to 25 percent of the work force. And, interestingly, the money supply contracted by 25 percent. This monetary contraction played a huge role in creating and sustaining the Great Depression. At the time, the Federal Reserve did little to stop the process. Indeed, it probably exacerbated it. By contrast, after the events of 2008/9, the deflationary process was halted by QE here and in the Eurozone and in the UK and in Japan. Halted by central banks printing money. Now, although we refer to the years after 2008/9 as the Great Recession, the fall in output during that period, that downturn, was only about 4 percent. What could have been a rerun of the Great Depression, or even worse, was stopped in its tracks. Now, of course, the critics will say that this is all very well, but the policy will end in failure because inflation will pick up dramatically. In fact, there's no need for inflation to pick up dramatically. QE can be set into reverse. The central bank can impose reserve requirements, and indeed it can also raise interest rates. The oft quoted example of Zimbabwe, which is  which has suffered from hyperinflation, is simply not apposite at all. This is not a case of QE gone wrong. Rather, it's a result of gross government incompetence in bringing taxes to balance with expenditure. The U.S. isn't and can never become Zimbabwe. Other critics point to distortions in the economy created by the policy of QE. But to some extent, this is fair. There are some distortions created. But where are the distortions sufficient to outweigh the creation of 13 million U.S. jobs since the downturn? The greatest distortion is in fact in the critic's sense of balance and perspective. Other critics argue they accept the idea that QE has saved the economy from something like the Great Depression. But interestingly, against the other bunch of critics, they say it would have been better if we had had a repeat of the Great Depression. Collapse is good! It would have purged the system. And what would have emerged at the end of all this would have been something stronger. Well, all I can say is that this purging of the system didn't exactly bring great benefits in the 1930s either in this country or indeed in Germany. The conclusion is clear. When the need arises, not only can central banks print prosperity, but they must. It is their bounden duty."

    "data": "Good evening. I feel very privileged to be here tonight with these distinguished colleagues. I feel very privileged to be discussing a central bank like the Fed. In the case of the Fed, I have a great respect for the institution. These are smart, wellintentioned people. I know this because I worked with them for over 10 years. Indeed, as I hinted to you before, if you want to see what a central bank money printer looks like, you're looking at one right now, although just to level some expectations, most of them have a lot more hair than I do. My main argument tonight is a practice of a theory won. I, too, once believed that central banks could print prosperity, and I was assigned with the task of actually spending the Fed's money. Now, even in this debate, you will see that my partner and I come at this topic from somewhat different perspectives. But where I know that Ed and I both strongly agree is that central bank money printing, activist monetary policy, is an unproductive tool when it comes to creating prosperity. What I'd add from my own perspective is that I believe that if it works at all, activist monetary policy has become counterproductive. It's potentially impairing future prosperity. Let's be honest about something to begin with. You guys all deserve a gold star for being here. Monetary policy is a very arcane subject. Discussing it in class in Rutgers is the closest thing I've found thus far to prescribing Ambien to my students. Also, there's quite a bit of history. You can talk about the Burns Fed, you can talk about the Greenspan Fed. But I submit to you that what we're debating today is what the Fed and other central banks around the world began to do as of late 2008. Let me briefly take you back there. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the U.S. economy was contracting by 2 percent in just three months alone. 2 million Americans were losing their jobs. Enter the Fed. Before and around the collapse of Lehman Brothers two months earlier, it had already extended more than $1.5 trillion in emergency loans, which along with Congress' TARP, stabilized Wall Street. Now on Black Friday, 2008, on the day after Thanksgiving, the Fed launched something known as quantitative easing, the largest economic stimulus program in world history. The Fed was attempting a new experimental approach to try to help the larger economy, not just Wall Street. What is QE? Well, we've talked about it a little bit already. QE is basically a central bank like the Fed printing electronic money, known as reserves, and using those reserves to buy bonds, existing credit from Wall Street banks. The goal, essentially at the beginning, the Fed was pumping cash into banks with the intention of stimulating a new wave of Wall Street credit creation in America. By both artificially making credit cheaper while freeing up lending capacity within the banks, the Fed was hoping to get more credit into the hands of citizens and businesses struggling from the economic downturn. In fact, before quantitative easing, Chairman Bernanke first called the initiative credit easing. That's where I came into the picture. I was asked by the Fed to run a task with executing QE therapy's program, that $1.25 trillion initiative. And that's where, quite frankly, I started losing a lot more hair. My perspective today is shaped by what I saw inside the Fed. And what I saw inside the Fed is that in practice we were basically pushing on a string with our money printing. What does that mean? In the end, from 2008 until 2014, when QE ended in America, the Fed printed and spent almost $4 trillion. What happened with that cash? Well, two out of every three dollars has ended up sitting idle in Wall Street banks. Today, specifically, $2.6 trillion of the Fed's cash sits in the big Wall Street banks, being banked like them at the Fed for interest like you and I might have a savings account. What happened to the other onethird of the cash? My own program is instructive. With our bond buying, we were specifically trying to stimulate U.S. mortgage lending by Wall Street banks. More home loans and more refis. But from the first day of the bond buying to the last, while we were pumping $1.25 trillion in reserves into the banks, the banks consistently cut their mortgage lending. By the end of the program, U.S. mortgage lending was down by 33 percent. And yet at the same time, what we saw on the desk was that instead of lending, Wall Street banks began to use whatever cash they did deploy speculatively, investing it. J.P. Morgan, Citi, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, you name it. They were using the cash mainly to pile into stocks, bonds, and commodities. This wasn't illegal. It was simply unproductive. It was the Fed pushing on a string with its cash. The Fed wasn't inducing consumption or real business investment in the economy with QE. What was the ultimate impact of Fed QE? Well, just to start with, 2009, the first full year of QE, was the most profitable revenue year ever in Wall Street history. Let me repeat that. The most profitable revenue year ever in Wall Street history. It's incredible. Today our too big to fail banks are 37 percent bigger, generating 40 percent more income annually than they were before 2008. Much of that remains fueled by their massive speculative investments in the financial markets, which may be distorting those markets, as Roger has alluded to. By 2010, in fact, the Fed began to speak with the impacts of QE differently. It starts adjusting that QE was benefiting America by artificially stimulating the financial markets and generating the wealth effects, fueling consumption by making more welloff Americans wealthier. Basically, that's trickle down economics, Fed style. And yet the claim of QE, helping average Americans, remains dubious. In 2013, McKinsey, the consulting firm, put out a study on the impact of Fed money printing, saying that for every $1 that Wall Street was being subsidized by QE, the average American household was losing $2.50. The existential problem with Central Bank money printing is how the tool works. The transmission mechanism, pumping cash into Wall Street banks, is inherently flawed. It doesn't create prosperity, or even if it does so marginally it's basically creating prosperity for people who don't need the help, the Jamie Dimons and Lloyd Blankfeins of the world. It's not really helping that two thirds of Americans that are now living paycheck to paycheck. And unfortunately post financial crisis, what that really means is that money printing has only served to reinforce the reality of a chronically underperforming U.S. economy. In the end, Central Banks don't print prosperity. If anything, over time, money printing has only helped us kick the can of desperately needed reform further down the road. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you very much, and thank you for coming out to listen to this debate. Actually I hear that Intelligence Squared Debates are a very good date night, is that correct? There's some nervous laughter from the back. You know, this may seem arcane to you. And Andrew said it is arcane. I don't think it's arcane at all. I think this debate and this particular question goes to the heart of the nature of the American republic. I do have one of those strange British accents. I will concede that, but I do know also a lot of American history. And by my account, this is the sixth time in American history when there has been an intense public debate on exactly this question. Perhaps the wording was slightly different before. It was debated at the beginning of the republic. It was debated intensely under Andrew Jackson in the 1830s. It was debated before the Fed was set up in 1913. It was debated absolutely in this city in the 1970s, and here we are after 2008. And the question  the question, it's really of fundamental importance to focus on the question before us. And the wording matters, Central Banks Can Print, that's the first part. And I think we agree, and I think Andrew said he'll do some more printing for you at the back, if you're interested afterwards. So we know they can print, but what is it they are printing? And we don't even print money. I mean, that's obviously  and my partner explained to you exactly the mechanics of that. But what does it mean in an economy when the Central Bank prints money? And, remember, this is not the economy of the 1780s or the economy of Andrew Jackson or even the economy of New York City at the turn of the  beginning of the 20th century when people began to realize that industry was developing, commerce had become more complicated, and you could have crises and panics, and the private sector couldn't necessarily take care of that by itself. That was the beginning of the thinking that led to the Central Bank. But is it prosperity that the Central Bank can bring you by printing? Well, this question was answered directly in very  as close as you can get by looking at history to the relevant facts and a parallel to today's experience  in the 1930s. In the 1930s, people like our opponents today, distinguished practitioners, people with an immense amount of experience, and people to whom the nation looked for guidance on complex monetary matters, almost all of those people in the 1930s said categorically, based on an enormous amount of experience  they said in the 1930s, The Central Bank cannot print prosperity. And the Central Bank didn't. The Federal Reserve didn't. The Federal Reserve, which had a particular version of that in its mind that was linked to a belief in the gold standard, did not respond to the crisis, did not respond to the panic, did not respond to the run on banks, did not do what Milton Friedman said. Milton Friedman, not a man of the left, a great University of Chicago economist, his history  Monetary History of the United States, with Anna Schwartz, is a mustread  okay, maybe not on a date night  but it's a mustread. Friedman and Schwartz said, The Federal Reserve made a big mistake. They should have printed money and they didn't. And you got a Great Depression with cataclysmic results. Now, what happened after 2008? That's the question Andrew put to you, and I think he put it to you very fairly. I understand it was frustrating, Andrew. I understand it was difficult. But I would like to say  and I'm on this podium, on this stage today, at this podium right now to say, Thank you to Andrew. Thank you to people from the New York Fed who I know in the audience. Thank you to those other officials at the Federal Reserve. Thank you to Ben Bernanke. I have not agreed with these people on all matters. I do not agree with them on issues related, for example, to financial regulation. And I'm not happy with the fact we had a crisis. And I think it was a disaster for many  or most people in this country. A disaster that stays with us forever, John, lasting impact. But in  I'm the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, okay? And I've worked on crisis for 30 years. When you're in a crisis, when everything is going to hell, you have to step up if you're the Central Bank. You have to save the day. The option is to rerun a version of the 1930s. And if you want to do that, then take control of the Federal Reserve, put them in a straitjacket  this is actually a proposal right now in Washington, D.C.  and prevent them from responding to the next crisis. You will get another Great Depression under those circumstances. We need flexibility. We need pragmatism. We need people like Andrew and his colleagues when they were at the Fed. Smart, creative people who look at the situation and try to prevent it from getting worse. And I think that's the prosperity that I want to focus on, Andrew, which is  yes, I understand it was difficult. I understand you didn't get everything you wanted. You didn't get everything that any of us wanted. I understand it felt like you were pushing on a string some days. And I understand you lost some hair. And I'm sorry about that too. That may be  maybe nothing I can do about that one. But what would have happened if the Federal Reserve hadn't done that? Interest rates would have been higher. It would have been much harder to borrow. Credit would have been completely disrupted. This is not the 1830s. This is not 1913. It's not even 1930s. Credit is in every  you have credit in your wallets. You have credit connected with your mortgage. You have credit in every single part of your business life, your personal life, your financing of education, how you plan for your children's future, your retirement  it's all intertwined. If you let the credit system collapse  and that's what my partner emphasized to you  that is what would have happened. And that is what has happened in countries where the central bank has either not been willing to do this, or has refused to do this, or has been prevented by circumstances beyond their control from doing it. In the United States and in other leading industrial economies, central banks can print prosperity. If you let them do it under those circumstances, in the face of the crisis, you get a better economic outcome than you would otherwise. The options  the alternative is very, very bleak. So, it's not perfect, and we're surely not recommending that you do this every day and all day. But under these circumstances, when faced by a crisis and a panic  such as that one faced in the U.S. in 2008, such as that faced by the U.S. in the 1930s  central banks, under those circumstances, can, should, and must print prosperity. Thank you."

    "data": "Don't let our opponents hijack this debate. This is not a debate about whether the Fed should act as a lender of last resort in a run on the banks. We all agree with that point that they have made. And that's why they've taken this position, because you can't disagree with it. This is a debate about radical monetary policy that tries to print money in order to stimulate growth after a bank run in a recession. This is not QE1. This is QEinfinity. It's easiest to understand monetary policy by considering a simple corn economy. We can plant the corn. That's investment. We can eat it. That's consumption. Or we can store the corn in a silo and exchange it for a piece of paper that says, I owe you a bushel of corn. That's money. Recessions occur when people get scared and start storing corn instead of eating it or planting it. Growth slows and unemployment rises. It's important to recognize the Fed doesn't grow corn, nor can it teleport corn back from the future and spend it today. All it can do is print IOUs. By printing more IOUs, monetary policy tries to change your behavior today. It motivates you to stop saving and start spending again. It does this by threatening the value of your savings with price inflation in the future. With more IOUs outstanding, you should logically run to the bank, to the silo, withdraw your corn and use it before the economy recovers, people start exchanging IOUs for corn, and the silos run low on corn, when prices rise and the dollar is worth less. But here is the rub. The Fed increased the monetary base from 800 billion to 4 trillion, an unprecedented fivefold increase in the monetary base, and it had no effect on anyone's sphere of inflation whatsoever. No one ran to the banks to spend their savings. The money sat unused, neither lent nor borrowed, creating neither growth nor inflation. Why? Because the Fed has promised to prevent inflation by contracting the money supply before the economy recovers and people start exchanging IOUs for corn. With hard fought decades of successfully defeating price inflation, the Fed has earned its credibility. And with the Republicans threatening the Fed's independence if it doesn't fight inflation, the Fed's promise has even more credibility. Advocates of quantitative easing pretend that we can have our cake and eat it too, that we can scare savers into spending by printing money without needing to inflict the cost of inflation on the economy after it recovers. But it didn't work when we needed the stimulus. Even Ben Bernanke now admits quantitative easing will only work if it's permanent, if it's guaranteed to inflict inflation on the economy. But nowhere does he advocate making quantitative easing permanent because of the damage it inflicts. And the Fed increased the monetary base while the government was pumping $6 trillion of fiscal stimulus into the economy, increasing debt from 30 percent of GDP to 70 percent. That's six times more than the trilliondollar stimulus Krugman initially complained was too small. And even with aggressive fiscal stimulus, which advocates of stimulus contend is far more powerful than monetary stimulus, we saw no bounce back in growth whatsoever. Instead, we've seen tepid growth of a permanently lower base for six years and counting. It's true the Fed has recovered faster than Europe. But the U.S. has been growing faster than Europe for decades because of Silicon Valley and entrepreneurial risk taking. And for three decades and counting, Japan has tried the same thing; large fiscal deficits and near zero interest rates with nothing but slow growth to show for it. Now advocates of monetary policy insist, if the Fed recklessly throws the steering wheel out the window and balloons the monetary base to 9 trillion, that will scare everyone into spending. Perhaps it will. But the truth has been revealed. It takes a massive amount of monetary inflation to produce a miniscule increase in demand, enormous risk for little, if any, benefit. No mainstream economist takes these reckless proposals seriously. Our opponents will ignore these risks and claim only that lower interest rates and wealth effects stimulate investment, despite Ben Bernanke's admission that, Quantitative easing works in practice, just not in theory. But the economists in the audience know that after decades of research there's no consensus whether interest rates, especially shortterm overnight borrowing rates, affect real longterm investment. Why? Because unused corn lowers interest rates and makes investment cheaper, not more paper IOUs. Roger speculates in his oped the quantitative easing may account for about an additional onethird of a percentage point reduction in the interest rate. Who believes a reduction in interest rates, especially a measly third of a percentage point, determines how fast Apple develops the next generation iPhone? Like all companies, Apple can't afford not to innovate and invest as fast as it can, no matter the interest rate. Real increases in wealth might stimulate investment but nobody's fooled by equity prices inflated by low interest rates at an increased risk of inflation. If the Fed does nothing more than print IOUs, who here believes that increases wealth? Phony IOUs increase risk. Risk reduces wealth. The economy may not be perfectly rational, but business leaders who create prosperity aren't stupid either. They surely don't increase investment and risk taking in the face of increased government spending and the risk of inflation. They dial back. There is simply no compelling evidence that fiscal and monetary stimulus increases real business investment. If anything, the evidence shows the opposite, a dial back in business investment in the face of risky stimulus. And no surprise, in the wake of $3 trillion of monetary stimulus and $6 trillion of fiscal stimulus, lackluster business investment and unusually slow productivity growth have been chief reasons for the slow recovery. Financial speculators, many who borrow short to buy longterm financial assets may be sensitive to shortterm rates, doubly so given the amplifying effects of herd mentality. But financial arbitrage is a zero sum game that does nothing to grow the economy. Quantitative easing doesn't work in theory. That's why it doesn't work in practice either. After $4 trillion of quantitative easing, Ben Bernanke has reconsidered his view. Last month in the Wall Street Journal, he admitted, The Fed cannot print its way to prosperity because the Fed has no control over longterm economic fundamentals. Don't let these guys fool you. There's no free lunch. Don't give reckless monetary policy a BandAid. Only hard work, investment, innovation, successful risk taking create prosperity. Side with Ben Bernanke and vote against the motion, Central Banks Can Print Their Way to Prosperity. Don't let these guys hijack the debate and make it a debate about whether the Fed should have bailed out the banking system. I was on TV last week telling everybody that the Fed needed to bail out the banking system. There isn't a serious economist on the planet who disagrees with that. And the reason why they've taken the debate there instead of to QEinfinity, what has occurred for the six years after the bailout in the crisis is because it didn't work, and they know it. Vote against quantitative easing will create prosperity. It has created no prosperity."

    "data": "Six minutes. You have no idea how difficult this is for a former judge, but I'll do it. Let me set the stage. Mr. Alvarez, who is Hispanic, or Mr. Hargrove who is black is before me. I'm taking a plea. He's pleading guilty to distributing a quantity of drugs for which he's going to get a fiveyear mandatory minimum. I lean over and I say, Sir, has anyone coerced you into pleading guilty? Oh no, your honor, he says. I know that that's not true. It's not coercion like waterboarding or thumb screws, but it is coercion nonetheless. The prosecutor said to him, If you don't plead guilty to this one count I'll charge you with three. It'll be a 15year mandatory minimum, five years, 15. This was a coerced plea. The prosecutor might say, Plead now or the deal is going to change. It's like dealing with liberty as if it were a sale at Macy's. And when you rush to plead you won't know much about the case against you. The prosecutor is supposed to disclose evidence that is exonerating, evidence that is exculpating, but too often the rush to plead guilty means you don't get that information. Too often too many play hide the ball. Nevertheless, I turn to Mr. Alvarez or Mr. Hargrove and I say I accept the plea and I sentence him to five years. There's no judging going on here. Nothing is going on in an open courtroom. No one is subject to appeal. As Judge Gleeson said in a comparable situation in the southern district of New York, sentencing to a mandatory minimum has all the solemnity of a driver's license renewal. Make no mistake about it, I didn't sentence him. The prosecutor sentenced him. The prosecutor was the judge, jury, and executioner. And it's not just Mr. Alvarez or Hargrove. It's Aaron Swartz, the 26yearold Internet prodigy accused of computer fraud for downloading scholarly articles off of the organization called JSTOR. He was offered a sixmonth sentence if he pled guilty or seven years if he went to trial. And he committed suicide. Or Kevin Ring, who was prosecuted for a lobbying scandal. After trial, the prosecutor recommended 17 to 22 years. When Jack Abramowitz, who was the head of the scandal, who was the ring leader, was offered four on a plea. 90 percent of federal trials plead guilty. Ninetyfive percent of state trials you don't raise Constitutional challenges. It would interfere with the plea. You don't raise meaningful defenses. A battered women syndrome, for example, you don't want to raise that because if you do, the deal will be gone. You don't want to raise challenges to flawed forensic evidence. Coercion, yes. Now, Who cares? you might say. They all plead guilty. After all, they're probably guilty. There were 1,576 exonerations in the United States since 1989. 10 percent of them were pleas plainly in that group, because it's so difficult to get exonerations where other claims of innocence. Who cares, you might say? We get people to cooperate. The system becomes much more efficient. I'm from Boston. Jimmy Martorano pled guilty to 20 murders for which he got 14 years in exchange for his testimony against Whitey Bulger. Who cares? you might say. Cooperators give truthful testimony. It's the way the system works. The best way I can describe that is something a former partner of mine said. Sometimes, not always, cooperators don't just sing. They compose. It's not just mandatory minimums. It's vague statutes, vague laws that enable prosecutors to pick the person and then the crime. Harvey Silverglate calls it three felonies a day, where there are multiple counts for a single incident, vastly increasing the possibility that you'll get an extraordinary sentence. This can destroy companies. Arthur Anderson went under before the Supreme Court reversed the conviction. And Aaron Schwartz died. Surely, there are wonderful prosecutors that are on this stage today. They'll say they're doing God's work. Trust me, one said to me, charging a first offender with a 15year mandatory minimum. But we are rightly skeptical in this country about concentrations of power. Trust us, they will say, Not those judges, judges, after all, who are not accountable. These are things, you always talk about good prosecutors and bad judges. But judges can be appealed, reviewed, bound by precedent. We're the only country in the world in which there are not generally career prosecutors, where being a prosecutors is a stepping stone to higher office. David Hoffman, I understand, has run for higher office. Sadly, defendants are, too often, those stones. Prosecutors have too much power. My colleagues on this stage will talk about the fabulous decisions that they have made. But the issue is not the rogue prosecutor. It's the endemic risk of power misapplied. It is about balance, the check of a judge, of a jury, an appeal. It is about transparency. It is about mass incarcerations which prosecutorial decisions are largely responsible. It is about coercion, and it is about, as my partner will say on this stage  sadly, it is also about race. U.S. prosecutors have too much power, have much too much power. Vote one. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you very much. Reid and I plan on making three points throughout our presentation tonight. I'm going to focus on the first one, which is to talk about the importance of prosecutorial power. We're also going to talk about the limits of prosecutorial power. And I think you're going to hear a very different version about the realities of prosecutorial power than the one you just heard from Judge Gertner. And third, we're going to be talking about  and making sure there's a recognition that there are certainly various problems in our criminal justice system in our society. My guess then problems that the four of us may completely agree on from the stage, that are not issues regarding prosecutorial power. And we're going to try to focus on the question presented this evening. Regarding the importance of prosecutorial power, the people who benefit the most from strong, effective prosecutorial power are those with the least power and resources in our society. Prosecutors and strong prosecutorial offices are an antidote against the most powerful. And therefore, this issue is in fact a social justice issue. The reason that I became prosecutor and many are drawn to it, where the harm of crime, where the burden of crime falls hardest on those at society in the low end of the spectrum, often where the harms regarding the crime are the least visible. Prosecutors in our society have a duty  have a duty to use the powers that are appropriate and that are strong to minimize the harm from crime on those who are the least powerful. And I'm going to talk briefly in this opening statement about public corruption crimes and about gang and gun violence crimes, topics that in Chicago we have a great deal of experience with, unfortunately. When there is a conspiracy by public officials to hand out public jobs or public contracts or to give public services in exchange for bribes or political favors, there are victims from that conduct. And the victims are people who are the regular people without connections, not involved in politics, who can't get that good paying job with security and benefits because they don't have connections, the people who get less desirable services, people who then have the perception of a system  correctly at times  of haves and have nots, based on political connections. How do you stop  how do you stop a secret effort by the most powerful public officials to hand out public goods to the politically powerful so they can maintain office? Perhaps an election would do the trick. But unless the corruption is exposed, that's quite unlikely in our current system. What it requires is a strong, independent prosecutor’s office to investigate and prove the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, unanimously to a 12person jury, where the crime itself was usually kept hidden in sophisticated ways by sophisticated people. And the key tools in that regard are wiretaps, flipping cooperators, getting people on the inside to cooperate, one of the most difficult things to do in law enforcement, where there are very strong reasons, always, not to cooperate, but where that cooperation may be essential to proving the crime. The dynamic with gangs and gun violence in Chicago is similar. And we know this from the horrific news stories we read too often. But look at the chart of who the victims are of gun violence described. Look at the map. In our still segregated city, those killed from guns are overwhelmingly black and Hispanic, who live in our lowincome neighborhoods. In the early 2000s, when I was in the U.S. attorney’s office, we paired up with local police and prosecutors to apply our prosecutorial resources where there were the most dead bodies, not just to make cases, but to try to lower the murder rate by making cases. Our methods of making cases against gang leaders and those who were the most violent gang members were very similar to what happens in the public corruption or organized crime context; try to use wiretaps whenever you can, try to flip people on the inside when you can get them to flip, and conduct a secret and confidential investigation using the grand jury. We knew we had to be successful at stopping gang leaders in order to make change, but we also knew you cannot prosecute your way out of this problem. And so we used strong federal gun laws not just to make some cases, but also to persuade those most likely to pick up a gun in a highcrime neighborhood, that they shouldn't do so. We started something called parolee forums, where we brought into a gym 30 parolees who had been paroled for gun crimes to the most violent neighborhoods, had community service leaders and law enforcement, and delivered a message to try to persuade people not to use a gun. Now, you make think this sounds a little pie in the sky, but after several years of this, this was studied by academics and found to have been one of the leading causes, along with other things law enforcement, that lowered the murder rate. And let me just put some numbers on this and try to humanize this a bit. There are two police districts, one in Englewood on the south side, one in  on the west side that I want to talk about. And then there's a police district north of here on the lake front. All those have 100,000 people in them. In the year before we started this, in 2001, 62 people were killed in the Englewood District, 70 on the West Side, and five on the lakefront. The racial breakup of those  of those districts, 98 percent and 92 percent black in the districts where there were the most murders and 74 percent white in the relatively safe one. Three years later after the program, the murder rate had been cut in half. So if you just look at those two districts, that's 70 additional people who are alive because the homicide rate had lowered. Let's have some seats for those people here tonight. These are people who generally are not at these debates. Let's put the people who are alive, because of strong prosecutorial action that has lowered homicide rates, in this room."

    "data": "My name is Paul Butler, and I represent the United States. That's how I used to start my opening argument. I represented the government in criminal court in the District of Columbia, and I used that power to put black people in prison and Latino people and poor people. Like a lot of prosecutors, that was pretty much all I did. During the time I did that work, I learned some things. What I learned is that prosecutors have too much power. Prosecutors have turned our great nation into the world's leading jailer. We have five percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's inmates. Prosecutors have made prison our primary social policy for poor people. About 80 percent of people who are locked up are poor. For AfricanAmericans this is horrific. There are more black people under criminal justice supervision than there were slaves in 1850. If you're a black male without a high school degree, you're more likely to be in prison than you are to have a job. Imagine the impact of all these prosecutions on black families. It's not just the guy doing time on the inside, but we have a lot of people in our community, women and children, especially, who are doing time on the outside. It's not just a problem for minorities. We lock up more people of every race now than we did 20 or 30 years ago. Right now we have one in 100 Americans who have a criminal case. We know that this obscene expansion of the prison population has little to do with the crime rate. When crime goes up, prosecutors put more people in prison. When crime goes down, prosecutors put more people in prison. When the crime rate stays the same, prosecutors put more people in prison. I speak from whence I know. I became a prosecutor because I don't like bullies. I stopped being a prosecutor because I don't like bullies. My  my power to be a bully came from the Supreme Court case called, Bordenkircher versus Hayes. Mr. Hayes wrote a bad check for $88. The prosecutor said, I'll ask the judge to give you five years if you save us the trouble of going to trial. If you don't take this deal and lose  and you lose the trial, we're going to ask for life. Mr. Hayes went to trial, lost, and he got life, a life sentence for writing a bad check for $88. Supreme Court said, It's all good. That, my friends, is why 97 percent of people who are prosecuted today end up pleading guilty. Prosecutors tell defendants, Unless you take this deal, we're going to bury your ass. I'm a hometown kid. I grew up in the South Side in a neighborhood not far from here in miles but in another way of speaking it's a world away. The police were notorious in my neighborhood for how they treated black boys. I got to graduate high school and go to Yale, but lots of my homeboys went to jail. I knew these guys were talented and smart, and most of them didn't get a fair shake from the criminal justice system. So I went in as an undercover brother who hoped to make a difference from the inside. But rather than change the system, the system changed me. You know what we called defendants in the office where I worked, cretins and douchebags. Lawyers, including me, were competitive, were ambitious. The incentives to move up in a prosecutor's office are to lock up as many people as you can for as long as you can. And, frankly, because prosecutors have so much power, it was easy to do. We have so many crimes in the U.S., no one has even been able to count them all, on the federal side alone, 4,000  at least 4,000. Justice Scalia said, Prosecutors have so much power, they can find a crime to charge anybody with. We made our decisions about who to prosecute in a conference room that didn't have any windows. Well, imagine a group of 20 and 30 and 40 year olds sitting around kind of playing God. One of my cases was against this guy who was a supply clerk at a government office, and this guy had a little side hustle where he was selling film that belonged to the government. So we arranged this sting to send in this undercover agent to pretend to be somebody who wanted to buy film. The clerk says, I can sell you as much film as you'd like. Our agent was like, Well how much? Can you do $500? Yeah. 1,000? Yeah. $5,000? Yeah. Every time the clerk said yes his sentence went up by years and years. And in the office, we were watching this on video and we were cracking up. When the clerk had agreed to sell the amount of film that would send him to jail for about 20 years someone said okay, let's put that dumbass out of his misery. Now as a prosecutor I had this guy under my thumb. I don't have to charge him with a crime. No judge can make me. Or I can throw the book at him, or I can charge him with a misdemeanor. It's my decision whether he's looking at probation or 20 years, and I'm making that decision in the privacy of my office. I don't have to explain to anybody what I'm doing. So I ask the dude, What can you do for me? Who can you snitch on? You scratch my back, I scratch yours, and we think about all the wrongful convictions, innocent people who have been sent to jail. Many of those cases come from prosecutors making deals like I did. Prosecutors use this power to go after people like Eric Garner in Staten Island for selling a single tobacco cigarette. Prosecutors use this power to put people like Michael Brown  he was stopped by the police for walking in the street. They prosecute that case. And how do federal prosecutors like Reid and David use this power? David said it's antidote to the powerful, but about 50 percent of the people his office prosecute who go to jail, they go to jail for drug crimes. Why has no one gone to jail for the financial crisis? Those are the real criminals. So, when David comes forward  when Reid comes forward, I want to know whether there are too many black and Latino people in prison in Chicago. I want to know why half of the people your office prosecutes are for drug crimes. I want to know if you can guarantee me that nobody's being biased against because they're African American or Latino."

    "data": "So, this evening we're going to touch on a lot of those issues and we're going to deal with mandatory minimums on our side and we're going to deal with racial disparity and whatever else you want to talk about, because we have the answers to all those in what was just described as not the office that David and I grew up and practiced in. But what I want to talk about in my opening is what often isn't discussed in the context. As the judge indicated, the perception is that prosecutors are judge, jury, and executioner. Well, let's talk about the checks and balances, significant checks and balances that exist throughout the system from beginning to end that actually significantly limit what a prosecutor can do and how a case proceeds. Let's use it in the context of a hypothetical. Let's take a bank robbery. Bank robbery occurs in Chicago. Person runs into the bank, robs the bank, runs out with money, maybe uses a weapon, is gone. At this point in time there is a single person who knows exactly what happened in that robbery, the robber. The prosecutor knows virtually nothing. So now the question becomes well, the prosecutor, will he ever be able to make a case against that individual? Maybe. They're going to try. They're going to try to build a case, but what people don't talk about is the number of cases that never get made. Many, many cases are never solved. In Chicago, our homicide rate unfortunate  do you know how many cases are actually resolved that end up in homicide? Just below 50 percent at this point. Over half the murders in Chicago go unsolved. But in our hypothetical, let's assume the prosecutor and the agents were able to get to a point where they want to charge the case. They think they know who did it. So, at the federal system what do they do? They go to a neutral third party. They go to a magistrate judge, and they say to the judge here's the evidence I think proves that this person did it by probable cause. That's the standard at the arrest stage. They want an arrest warrant. Neutral magistrate has a decision to make. Either yes I agree with you or no I don’t. Sometimes they reject it. Let's assume the magistrate says okay. Agent goes out, arrests the individual. Now where do we go? We go back in front of the neutral third party, the judge. We're going to debate bond. Does the defendant get bond? He will be represented or she will be represented. The prosecutor will make his argument. Defendant will make his argument. Then we go potentially to a probable cause hearing, again in front of the magistrate. What happens in front of the probable cause hearing? The prosecution must put on its witness, open the cross examination. The judge, again, must decide is there probable cause to believe this crime was committed? In our hypothetical, let’s assume, the judge finds that in fact there is probable cause. Of course, he hasn't even been indicted yet, so now we go to the grand jury, a group of people made up of individuals from society who are brought in, who are asked to listen to evidence. Now we're in the grand jury city. Now, you probably heard the phrase, Well, how much of a check or balance is that? The grand jury will indict a ham sandwich. Well, there is  that's a bit of a trite phrase, and you need to go underneath it. Let's get underneath these issues. Why is that? Because, one, prosecutors often don't ask for votes on cases where they don't think they can meet the standard. And two, pursuant to Department of Justice policy, you don't seek an indictment unless you have proof beyond a reasonable doubt. So the standard for indictment is here. You're going in here. So in our case, grand jury returns an indictment. There is probable cause. Now where do we go in the system? Now we go to the judge’s room, to the trial court where there is a brandnew, neutral third party who is going to oversee everything that happens from here on out, whose job is to make sure, much like the prosecutor, that justice is done. And what happens? Well, now, what's the burden? The burden on the prosecutor is the highest burden known in the law in United States, proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendants unhappy with discovery? Defendants unhappy with the way the prosecutor's acting? Defendants unhappy with anything? Bring a motion. You've got a judge who will decide that motion. So how will the case resolve itself? Well, typically one of three ways. One, it could be dismissed. That does happen from time to time. Prosecutors exercise discretion. They choose not to go forward even at that point. Two, the defendant could plead guilty, which means  just so we're clear  the defendant walks into court, raises their right hand to take an oath to tell the truth, and admits that they committed the crime. It is the judge's job to determine whether they are satisfied with that determination. The judge has got to determine whether or not it's voluntarily, whether it's knowing. Or it goes to trial. And what happens at trial? In the United States  and it's a good system  the prosecutor must prove to 12 people unanimously that there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. One juror looks at that case and decides there's reasonable doubt, there's no conviction. And what happens after the conviction? Then the judge looks at it again, and the judge can decide, I think the jury got it wrong. I'm throwing the case out. Now we go to sentencing. Does the prosecutor from on high say what the sentence is? No. That's not what happens. Prosecutor makes their argument. Here is what I think is mitigating, aggravating. Here is what I think the sentence should be. Now it's the defendant's turn, through counsel. Here's what's aggravating, maybe, here's what's mitigating. And the defendant gets an opportunity to talk to the judge without being crossexamined. And then the judge decides what the sentence is. And we'll talk about mandatory minimums and how that comes into play. Then are we done? No, we're still not done, because now the defendant gets to go to a brandnew courtroom, the appellate court, where three brandnew judges look at the issue. They're completely neutral. And the defendant can raise whatever he or she wants, issues about the trial, issues about the plea, issues about the sentencing. It's all overseen through that check and balance. And then when that is done, they still can come back through what's called a 2255, which is basically the federal version of a habeas. So if we're going to have a discussion about whether prosecutors have too much power, let's at least frame it within the system that we have today, that puts significant checks and balances. And at the end of the evening, what you are going to see is that prosecutors do not have too much power, and the correct vote is against the vote  the motion, number 2."

    "data": "Good evening. Thank you to our host, moderator, and participants in this debate. My name is Nita Farahany . And I am here to convince you that college students should be allowed to take smart drugs. In a little while, you'll hear from my partner, Anjan Chatterjee, who will debunk many of the scientific claims against smart drugs. Before that, I want to convince you of two things. First, colleges should empower students to make their own choices about how they will change their brains. And, second, the gradual improvement of our brains is a social good that we should pursue in society. Colleges should educate and empower students to make informed choices about smart drugs. There's a common saying in education that we should teach students how to think, not what to think. Teaching a student how to think encourages them to question their own bel ief and to question the claims that they are presented with. Banning smart drugs disempowers students from making educated choices for themselves. And it denies them their ability to think smarter. Being protective of students and telling them what to do to change their brains leaves students poorly prepared for life after college in a world that will present them with choices and with pressure. A campus culture built on prohibitions and policing students is a campus that is at odds with encouraging freedom of thought and liberty. It fosters fear and ignorance instead of courageous deliberation. A recent online poll found one in five of the 1,400 respondents had used Ritalin, Provigil, or beta blockers for non medical purposes. Polls at in coming college freshmen show that at least one in three has used smart drugs. We can pretend that this isn't a choice that large swaths of people are already making. Or we can embrace that smart drugs are just one of the many ways that people exercise free choices in their lives. Colleges are incredibly wellpositioned to equip students with the information and the skills necessary to balance the risks and benefits of taking or foregoing these drugs. It's time that we recognize that college students are moral agents, capable of acting freely and making judgments for which they can be praised, blamed, or held responsible. We should respect their dignity and enable them to decide whether caffeine, prep classes, neural stimulation, exercise, or smart drugs are ways that they want to change their brains. Look what's happening in high schools around the country when bans on so called dangerous substances are being made. One school administrator from Indiana testified before Congress that high school students in his district are trafficking banned foods on school property thanks to a federal law prohibiting what can be served in school lunch rooms. Students have been caught bringing in  even selling  salt, pepper, sugar in schools  add taste to the bland and tasteless cafeteria food. This is a sad reality of what bans do in educational settings. They spur underground markets where the very goods prohibited become more alluring and go unchecked. This puts students at greater danger of ta king tampered substances without the benefit of transparency. Instead of banning salt, pepper, sugar, soda, or smart drugs, let's teach students how to weigh the risks and benefits and to make choices for themselves. This says nothing, of course, about the frightening intrusion into private lives of college students to enforce a ban on smart drugs. Can you imagine regular screening and testing of students to try to detect taking these drugs? But I want to convince you of a second thin: that enhancing our brains is a social good that we should be pursuing. The gradual improvement in how our brains function is a social good worth pursuing, and a social good we pursue all the time. We enhance our brains all the time and every day, from coffee we drink first thing in the morning, to SAT prep classes we take to gain college admission, the music classes we enroll in, the basic nutrition we follow, the exercise we undertake, the classes we attend. All of these things change our brains, and that's a great thing. To the extent that smart drugs work to improve focus, motivation, attention, concentration, or memory  we should celebrate them, not prohibit them. What if taking a smart drug gives us the capacity to study harder, longer, and better such that we cure cancer? Or develop tools for staying in better touch, resolving social ills, or for improving our overall happiness? Shouldn't we encourage, rather than ban, these opportunities? Improving our brain functioning can influence important outcomes for individuals, like making them more successful at work, enhancing their earning potential, alleviating their likelihood of experiencing social and economic difficulties, and improving their overall wellbeing. Widespread improvement i n cognitive function would result in widespread societal benefits, like economic gains or even reducing dangerous errors. Shouldn't we encourage this? We shouldn't think of smart drugs like taking steroids in sports. Life isn't a competitive game, where there are winners and there are losers and spectators on the sidelines. Improving our brains is inherently valuable in and of itself. And not because it offers some kind of competitive advantage for one person versus another. Improving our memory, our motivation, our concentration, our capacities improves our opportunities in life, which can mean better living conditions and greater flourishing for all of us. Knowledge is a good in and of itself. And using smart drugs to give us access to even more knowledge is truly invaluable. We should celebrate and not prohibit these opportunities. You'll hear fear mongering talks about coercion and the vulnerability of students tonight, on being on the slippery slope toward a dystopia and a rat race of enhancements. These fear tactics are just that: fear. Not only are smart drugs not bad, they may offer significant good. But regardless, it's up to college students as moral agents to decide for themselves. I urge you to vote in favor of personal choice and freedom, to vote in favor of educational institutions serving as educators and not nannies. And in favor of collectively improving our insights and our opportunities in life. Thank you."

    "data": "Good evening, members of the public, fellow debaters, and thank you, organizers for allowing me to come to Washington. It's always a welcome opportunity to warm up a little bit from the cold weather in Montreal. So tonight I hope to convince you that we should reject the motion that we have before us. And this won't be an enigmatic stance on my behalf. I think the facts, the scientific facts and sound reasoning and policy bring us there. I'll make two remarks in my short introductory remarks. First of all, I try to unpack a little bit the proposition before us. What do we mean by smart drugs, for example? Second, I'll try to highlight that there have been two major moral criteria put forward to assess these smart drugs. Moral acceptability and moral praise worthiness .And I think if you're committed to the foundations of both these tenses, you will reject the motion before us. So first, a couple of remarks on the proposition. Smart drugs, do they exist? Well, if we look at scientific reviews that have been published on this, it doesn't seem to be the case. There is no scientific reviews suggesting that these drugs are efficacious, that they actually improve cognition and intelligence in those who use them. Furthermore, we don't even know for whom they would work and what would be the risks entailed by their use on the long run. So I think smart drugs don't exist, so we don't have to allow them because, really, they're not  we're not there yet. A second important piece of the proposition tonight is the allowing. Who should be doing the allowing? Should it be college students? Obviously, that would be a bit contradictory. Should it be college administrations? I could  I think it could have destined [spelled phonetically] interests in pressure their students to use drugs to gain advantage. Physicians, probably not also  they could have also an interest in caring for the worried well. So I think this is really a question that we should be answering and tackling at the very highest level of moral and political analysis. It concerns all of us, because if once, if ever, these drugs are out of the barn and start getting more traction, all of us will be concerned. It will impact college environments, the workplace and so on. Second set of remarks: Now, what are the moral criteria to assess if this is ethical? Should we be engaging in cognitive enhancement and the use of smart drugs? As I mentioned, two major moral positions have been put on the table. I'll try to explain them very briefly and come back to it in the Q and A. First of all, moral acceptability is basically capturing a basic set of concerns and trying at liberal democracy. If, for example, tonight you were worried from the ethics standpoint, if ever college students would be free and autonomous in making such decisions, that's a concern reflected in moral acceptability. If you thought that perhaps we didn't have or were concerned that we didn't have the data to suggest that these drugs were safe and efficacious, that's also a fundamental condition of basic moral acceptability. And we don't have these data. We don't pilot studies about the autonomy of students. We don't have convincing data that these drugs work. So I think from the standpoint of moral acceptability, we need to reject the proposition. But furthermore, if you were concerned by other types of issues that we capture under the label of moral praiseworthiness, you could also be rejecting the motion. If, for example, from the ethics standpoint, you were worried that perhaps this is not a genuine way to achieve oneself, it is not a proper way to seek self fulfillment. That it's somehow cheating or threatening our moral ideals. That's a concern captured under the label of moral praiseworthiness. If, from the medical and scientific standpoint you were worried that perhaps physicians would be diverted as a resource from attending to important neurological or psychiatric conditions, for example, that would be a concern captured under the umbrella of moral praiseworthiness, i.e., is this practice morally laudable and praiseworthy? And the answer is no. No, because we haven't really debated this issue. We haven't made up our minds. We haven't been discussing with our neighbors and in public enough to really know if this is something we w ant to generally pursue. So I hope to have convinced you that it is premature at this point in time to consider the practice of using smart drugs to be, A, morally acceptable, and B, moreover, morally praiseworthy. And if you're still convinced yet, my colleague and partner, Nicole Vincent, will stretch the arguments further to show that even if you would grant some minimal moral acceptability to the practice, there would be still substantive issues to grasp with. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. When people come to see me in the clinic, they have choices. They can choose not to see me, but if they're there, they presumably have already made that choice. They even have choices not to follow the recommendations I might make. Gone are the days when physicians basically told patients what to do and expected them to obey. And it's a good thing. We're in partnership with our patients to try to provide decent care. People have the right to choose. This is not the motion under consideration, but I would suggest this radical claim that college students are people. People have the right to choose what they would do or have done to their bodies, and college students have the right to choose what is done  or what they would do to their bodies. Of course, these choices have to be made with a certain amount of knowledge. We want people to be informed about their choices. And so what is the information? Eric correctly pointed out that the data that we have is woefully inadequate. What we do know is that most of these medications work on the Catecholamine systems, that is that they increase the level of norepinephrine and dopamine within neuronal synapses. And as best we can tell, these have effects on arousal, on attention, and sometimes on parts of our memory and parts of executive function, our ability to be  to navigate complex arenas. Now, you might be concerned about side effects. And some of the effects themselves are counterintuitive. So to the extent that there is data that some people actually improve with these medications, some studies suggest that people who are at the lower end of the distribution, with some of these abilities like working memory, actually improve more than people at the higher end of the spectrum. T here's some people who think that these don't actually improve cognition, but these are really drive drugs, that they increase motivation, and people feel good about themselves and motivated to work harder. Adverse effects, as a physician, the thing I would be most concerned about would be cardiovascular effects. People can have cardiac arrhythmias, can have heart attacks, can even have sudden death. Well, there were two studies published in 2011, one in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and the other in the New England Journal of Medicine. These are sort of standard top line medical journals that looked at many, many, many patients as a retrospective study, and basically found that the use of these kinds of stimulant medications did not confer any added risk, cardiovascular risks as compared to nonuser populations. There is a hypothetical risk of addiction, and we just don't know what the rates are of that. In my own practice of treating some people with ADD, not students that decided to come see me for this, that  one isn't struck by addiction being a very big issue. But, nonetheless, it is something to be aware of. But the point about all of this is that both the promise and the perils of smart drugs are probably overblown. And students should be made aware of what these promises and these perils are and, as Nita said, that what colleges are in the business of doing is educating students, educating students to navigate complicated situations when  where there's a certain amount of ambiguity.And we should not take that educational opportunity away from colleges as students are thinking about this. Now, I'm an empiricist by nature, and so what I would like to do  it looks like a fairly young crowd  is t hat for people in the audience that are either students now or have graduated from college in the last four years, raise your hands up and raise them real high so the people in the podcast can hear you. Okay. Keep your hands up. Keep them up. Keep them up. Okay, if you  I would say, I don't know, maybe 75, 80 percent, would you agree with that? Okay. All right, so keep your hands up. If you or someone you know has taken a smart drug, put down your hand. I think I see one, maybe two. Okay. So the cat is out of the bag. Let's just be real about this, okay? It is happening, and if you are concerned about this, one might be concerned about the coercive properties that  the coercive conditions in which students want to take these kinds of drugs. One might be concerned about the fact that we live in intensely competitive times where there are winner takeall environments where small incremental advantages produce disproportionate rewards. And we might be concerned about that, and I am; however, if one is concerned about that, we should be concerned about the social milieu in which we live. And prohibiting drugs is not the solution to that. It is as if one were then lopping off a minor head of a hydra when the monster still remains unphased. I would say, Take students seriously. Don't infantilize them. And if you respect their autonomy, vote for the motion that College Students Should Be Allowed to Take Smart Drugs. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. So in March this year, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues released a report called, Gray Matters: Volume Two. The report recommended, among other things, that once we develop safe and effective medications, safe and effective smart drugs, we should make sure that they are made available equally to everyone. I am very much in favor of equality, and I'm really glad that the commission which Nita over there is indeed on recognized and was sensitive to this right. This  we need more of this in politics. But here is my worry, that in focusing on the medical side effects, on all the medical problems, what they've actually overlooked is they've overlooked all the other ways that our lives can go really bad, not just because we've had various medical problems, worse than this. What I'm going to argue is that actually by providing equal access to these medications to everyone, all the things that we really value are going to be jeopardized. So what are the arguments in favor of smart drugs? So I'm just going to be talking about the safe and effective ones, right? These are the  this is the science fiction future. Presume that the arguments would go something like this. Here's one, Hey, maybe if I can have access to these medications, which don't have any bad side effects, maybe I can get through all the work that I need to get through quickly. And what then? Well, I’ll have spare time, right? And why is that good? Because then I can go and do the things that I really want to do  spend time with my family, maybe stare at the ceiling, which is my, you know, favorite occupation, while listening to music. Or perhaps being students  hey, you need to make sure that you can earn an income. Actually have enough time for a part time job. But would this actually happen? I don't think that would. And here's why. So, when you start taking these medications   and suppose that they work, like they do for everyone.And you think, Great, now I want to make sure that I'll get this work done and in half the time, maybe, and then I'll go off home. Do you think everybody else is going to do this as well? Or do yo u think some people might say, Huh, I'm going to work as much time as I would have, but I'll now get much better grades. Some people might say, Actually, look, guess what, I'm still not tired. I'm going to keep working. I'm going to make sure that I get awesome grades. Think of what this does to your grades  you've done a sufficiently good job. You've pulled the party line. Unfortunately, their actions are going to force you to not be able to get the very thing that you wanted  the extra time to make sure that you get those things that you wanted, right? Time with family. Time for you to relax or whatever else it is. They're going to force you to have to also give those things up through competition. Very simple. Here's another way in which I think people think that smart drugs might be helpful. It could get  maybe you can get better grades. Get that really awesome job, right? But remember, if everyone has access to those awesome medications, the ones that work for everyone  what if we figured it out  and in that particular scenario, all of us get exactly the same advantages. So, all the people who could get into those lovely professions  it's still them who can only get into those professions. So, unless you get a head start, you're an early adopter, you won't get the advantage. But think of what happens if you do get the early advantage, because you're an early adopter. Well, you initially extend your reach and you get into that position. Great. But then, of course, you've gotten into this new cadre. You've made life more difficult for them. The more people like you get into that particular cadre, the more they're going to feel like, Man, now I've got to compete harder. Either they work harder or they say  draw the obvious conclusion  l so take the smart drugs. The longer you remain committed to this position, all that's going to happen is that more people will enter into this particular field and start using smart drugs for exactly those same reasons. Eventually, once everybody else is on smart drugs, you will simply lose all that investment and time. And you will lose your job, because we'll simply go back up to the same normal. Everybody's going to equally benefit. It doesn't strike me that either of those strategies is going to actually get us those things that we want. If anything, they may even lead us to disaster. Now, the real arguments, I think, have to do with the sort of things that Nita over there pointed out  the possibility of scientific discovery, the possibility of better learning, right? Maybe we can develop better medications, cure cancer. Maybe we can develop better smart drugs. But this does not come without a cost. What  the cost is that when you insert smart drugs into the equation, into a really competitive society, what you are doing is you are increasing competition. You are making it possible for some people to up the ante even more. They can now say, I am actually going to try and get a further advantage. And I am going to work harder. Competition will increase. It's not going to decrease. The amount of time that you're going to have to do all those other things isn't going to be greater. It'll be less. If you care for all the other things in your life, think about what you will be using to purchase that lifestyle. I only came to this country two and a half y ears ago. And I've lived in six countries. People here work so hard  harder than any other country I've lived in. Do you really want to smart drugs, that are going to make you into even better oiled machines that can be like gladiators  getting rid of all the time in your life and not be able to get all the things that make life worth living? Nita and Anjan would you like you to vote for the proposition. That vote closes the door on the this particular discussion."

    "data": "So, thank you very much. I appreciate all of you being here. And I want to thank the organizers for having this debate. Not just because it's an important issue, but because my wife gave birth to our second daughter about 10 weeks ago, and that was the best night of sleep I've had in a long time last night here in New York. So, I will be asking for your support, along with Alison, for raising the gas tax by 10 cents. Now, in full disclosure, I want to admit that I prefer to pay less for gas. All right? I recognize that this initiative, while important, is not necessarily very popular. So I was trying to think back in my mind, when have I had to advocate for something that was important to me but not very popular? And I go back to 1992, when I needed a date for prom, right? Very important to me, not very popular. I hope I have more success here tonight. So, what else happened in 1992? It was the last time that the federal gas tax had been raised. Now, if the gas tax had been indexed back in 1992 to inflation, just like many other things are, right, it would be about 10 cents higher today. But because of political inability to take a tough vote on this issue, right, the gas tax has remained where it has been. So, think about that, though? That 1992 dollar, its purchasing power has been cut more than in half. So, a dollar today from 1992 is worth about 40 cents, right? So, a skeptic of  skeptics of government often say, Well, why can't government be more like business? Well, what business is out there taking in 1992 dollars in revenue and paying out 2015 dollars. Could you pay your expenses right now on what you were making in 1992, inflation adjusted? And other folks will say, well, you know, there are more cars on the road, and they're burning more gas. Well, cars today are much more fuel efficient. Some cars don't even use any gas. So  and more cars and trucks will mean more wear and tear on our highways. So the right thing to do is just to raise it, just like the cost of everything else has gone up. And as state DOTs, we are very focused on doing more with less and stretching those dollars further and further. In fact, if you look at state DOTs now, the vast majority of them have moved from expanding the system, even in our places that still need capacity, to maintaining the assets that we have, right? These are big, important systems, and we need to maintain them. Unfortunately  and in Colorado, all of  almost all of the money that we get goes to system preservation.We're not expanding the system right now. But the money that we're putting into that system does not equal a system that is improving. It's actually declining, and it's hard. It's a tough decision to say, let that bridge, or let that road go. It's not a good way to run a business. And government skeptics say things like, you know, why can't you do more with less? Why can't you be more efficient? I would argue we are doing more with less. We're doing a lot more with less. You know, we have changed, we have shrunk our agencies. We have changed the techniques and technologies we have used to extend the life of our roads. We repair bridges now in a weekend instead of taking months to do that, right? But even though our systems are not expanding, the demands are growing ever more. You know, I was talking to one of our, you know , people on the other side earlier, and they said they lived in MacLaine, Virginia. If you think about MacLaine, Virginia, right, it has grown up with lots of subdivisions. People want signals. They want new lanes. A new signal can cost $100,000 up front, and then it must be maintained seven days a week, 365 days a year, right? So we can't keep doing more with less. In we don't raise the federal gas tax, we're going to have to do less with less. And that means the system is going to suffer. But it's not just about maintaining our system. You know, Colorado is going through an economic boom right now, thanks to Governor Hickenlooper. And, you know, but our interstate system is causing us to choke on that growth. So the interstate system was designed in the 1960s in Colorado for a population of the 1980s that they thought would be about 3.3 million. We're at 5 1/2 people today. We're going to 8 million people in the next 20 years. Where are all those cars and drivers going to go, right? Are they going to sit on that existing system? So in Colorado right now, hundreds of thousands of motorists lose 40 hours a year out of their life sitting in congestion. Now, we have one project that's ready to go, just like there are projects across the country that could go, but for a lack of funding. And that project is to widen I25. It'll save lives, it'll reduce congestion. And that project will  at current funding levels, we'll get to that project in 2070. That means an entire generation of people will be born and likely die before we widen that roadway, right? That's not a good way to run a system. And it's not just about roadways. So here on the north  in the northeast where I used to work, I worked on the Northeast Corridor Commission. This is the  the trains that run from Washington, D.C. to Boston. And to call that system antiquated would be polite, right? There's a tunnel in Baltimore that was built in the 1870s. Trains have to go through it at 30 miles an hour. There's  there's a  there's a major bridge that takes 30 men and women to open by hand.That doesn't sound terribly efficient. The Bridge on the River Kwai was more modern, right? We desperately need a new tunnel underneath the Hudson to relieve train congestion here in New York. And people say, well, let the states pay for it. It's $10 billion. New Jersey says, We can't afford it. Let New York pay for it. New York says, We can't afford $10 billion. That's why you need a properly funded federal system. This has profound impacts on our country. I am the son of immigrants. And I can remember people talking about moving to this country because they thought that the streets were paved with gold, right? And our transportation system used to be the envy of the world, up until a very recent time. But in a very short period of time, it has changed dramatically. Now, many of you have probably flown internationally, right? If you fly into Newark or LAX from Mumbai, Dubai, Shanghai, right, are you flying into an airport that shouts, American primacy? Or are you thinking that the infrastructure I left was actually kind of nicer than the one we have here? And that has profound impacts for our country. And it's something we need to consider when we think about, well that's tough  it's a tough vote to take. We used to be able to build great things in this country. But in the last few years, this partisan politics has frozen our ability to raise the gas tax or do much of anything. You know, but to those who say that this is a partisan issue, you know, transportation used to be a bipartisan rallying cry. Even Libertarians could point to the words of Adam Smith who said, in The Wealth of Nations, that infrastructure was one of the few things that governments should invest in. Ronald Reagan, the patron saint of the Republican Party, raised the gas tax. And he said, in 1982, We simply cannot allow this magnificent system to deteriorate beyond repair. The bridges and haze we fail to repair today will have to be rebuilt tomorrow at many times the cost. It was true in '82, and it's true today. But I would close with the words of Adrian Moore, who is across the stage tonight, who, after participating in that commission which recommended a 10state gas tax increase, in 2009, said, I'm not excited about a gas tax increase, but the reality is, our current gas tax doesn't pay for the upkeep of the system. We can either let the roads go to hell, or we can pay more in gas tax. So join me, join Alison, and join Adrian. Thank you."

    "data": "Well, thanks a lot. I didn't know it was three against one  but it's great to be here. Look, I am pro roads. I am pro bridges, I am pro highways, I am pro electric grid, I am pro infrastructure, I'm pro cars, and I’m pro growth. So I don't think there's any of us who would disagree. We do need a renovation, a modernization of our transportation system in this country. There's no question about it. I think we would all agree with that. The question is really how best do we fund that. And I would make the argument that instead of raising the gas  federal gasoline tax  we should, we should reduce the federal gasoline tax. And what we ought to do is use the  lower the federal gasoline tax from 18 cents a gallon to somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 cents a gallon to pay for the interstate highway. But look, there's  you're exactly right. There's 42,000 miles of interstate highways in this country. It's one of the great triumphs of our country. But you know what? The interstate highway system was completed many, many, many years ago. It was completed in the mid1980s. Now it's basically a system that just needs to be kept up. We need to continue to fix potholes and so on. But that's a lot cheaper than it is to build the system in the first place. So what I'm going to do is devote about 5 cents of federal gasoline tax to modernizing our interstate highway system. And the rest of the money, reduce the federal gasoline tax and let every state raise its gas tax as is appropriate. So in Colorado, you could raise your gas tax to pay for your roads. In Illinois, my home state, we  we pay for the projects that we want to. And this gets to the point that Robert  that Bob Rosenkranz made, which is that the gas tax is  I agree with him. It's an efficient tax. It's not as efficient as we would like. There's probably better ways now to finance  finance roads than the gas tax, but it's a pretty good user fee system. But it's not a very good user fee system if I have to pay a gas tax living in Virginia to pay for roads and transit projects and other things in California. It doesn't make sense. The people in California should pay for those. And that's what I would  would favor. And by the way, many states, it is true that the federal gasoline tax has not been raised in many, many years, but states do raise their gas tax as voters demand better roads and so on. By the way, there are also times when voters say we don't want to raise the gas tax. So in Michigan, for example, there was a major  a referendum about 18 months ago where they were going to raise the gas tax for roads and other projects. And it was  it was defeated 8020. The voters said no, we don't want to pay higher gas taxes. Gas taxes come right out of the pocketbook of Americans. And every time you raise the federal gasoline tax by 1 penny, it takes a billion dollars, $1 million out of pockets of consumers. So I would say that there's a couple of other inefficiencies with the federal gas tax, that if we get rid of these inefficiencies, we wouldn't have to raise the gas tax at all. For  the most important one that we need to   the most problem we need to readdress right now is that when you pay your federal gasoline tax, many of you are probably not aware of this, but only about 75 cents of every dollar you pay in federal gasoline taxes goes to paying for roads and bridges and highways. Wow. That's a small  what happens to the other 25 cents, right? And the answer is, the other 25 cents goes to other types of systems that have nothing to do with roads and bridges and highways that people use  use the highway system. So a big percentage of that goes to transit projects. Now, look, you have transit. New York City is one of the few places in America where actually transit probably does make sense. I'm from Washington, D.C. where transit makes sense. But most  most other industries, transit is extraordinarily inefficient. More people in this country walk to work than use transit. So it's not a very good system of transporting people from one destination to another. And even if it is, the people who use the transit system should pay for the transit through the fees that they pay and the  the costs of riding the system. There's certainly no reason why somebody who's driving their car should have to pay for people who use transit. And if we do that  and, by the way, there's also a lot of this money that gets intercepted by just ridiculous projects. I mean, I live in Virginia where we built a  an extension of our transit project out to Dulles Airport. I don't know many  how you get out there. It is probably the most absurd transportation project in American history. Nobody's riding it. It cost $6 billion. For one tenth of the cost, we could have built just one more lane of highway and we could have gotten rid of all the congestion problems. You also have things like the California train to nowhere that probably many of you are aware of. It's a $70 billion project. Very few people are going to ride this train. It's paid for with federal money, and there's no way California would have ever paid for it if the people who  in California had to pay for it themselves. But they said, Yeah, let's build this because we're going to get money from other states. Those are inefficiencies. And when I'm  what I was telling you is that if we simply devoted every single penny of federal gasoline tax at 18 cents a gallon to building roads, we wouldn't have a problem  we wouldn't have any of the problems that you just heard about. That's all we have to do. And this gets to the user pays idea. People who use roads should pay for them, and they should pay for them through the federal gasoline tax, but people who are using the roads shouldn't have to pay for other things that they're not using. One of the things that you brought up was efficiency. And I just did a big study comparing Texas and California and the way that they spend money. And it turns out there is actually massive inefficiency in the way roads or bridges  roads are built in this country. And it has to do a lot of  with, you know, labor laws, environmental laws, and things like that. But let me just give you an example. So in Texas it costs about $100,000 per mile to build or repair a road, $100,000 a mile. In California, where you were from, it costs 250,000 to $300,000. It costs two to three times more to build a mile of highway. So I would submit to you there are a lot of ways to sweat out inefficiencies and cost excesses, and it would be more likely to happen if states had to pay for it themselves than if they got federal money. There's one other bugaboo out there that needs to be addressed, and that is if we were to repeal something called the DavisBacon Act  which is a law that requires kind of a super minimum wage that's paid on roads projects, it's essentially a law that benefits the unions. If we were to simply allow these projects to be competitively bid, we could substantially reduce the cost of federal road building. And if we did that  let me put it very simply  if we simply get rid of DavisBacon Act, for every four bridges that we build now, we get a fifth one for free. We get a fifth one for free. For every highways we build, for every four roads that we build, we get a fifth one for free. Why wouldn't we want to do that? And before we do things like raise people's taxes, why don't we do things like repeal the DavisBacon Act that will make roads more efficient? And, finally, we are moving into a new age of transportation, and that new age is going to involve things like the Google car, and it's going to involve things like tolling and things like that that are going to make, and, in my opinion, the gas tax obsolete. it's not going to be a good way to fund roads any longer. So thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you very much. I think if we're going to have a debate about raising the federal gas tax and asking the users to pay more, we also have to talk about the benefits that they'll get from that increase in investment in our highway and bridge program as well as the challenges we're going to face as a country if we do not make those needed investments. So raising the federal gas tax means increasing investment to repair and reconstruct the highways and bridges that are the backbone of our economy. It also means increasing investment in transit which provides mobility choices to millions of Americans every day and also gets cars off of our congested roadways. It also means raising  or increasing employment and economic output in every state as well as most importantly we're also talking about saving lives. Roadway conditions are a factor in about a third of all highway fatalities in this country. And when we make investments to improve our roads and bridges, we significantly can help reduce that number. So I want to talk tonight about how the National Transportation System is the foundation of our economy and why federal investment is so important to that, and how the federal gas tax is also a sustainable source of revenue over the next 10 to 20 years. And when we're talking about investing in our federal highway system, these are the roads and bridges that are key to our national economy. We're not talking about filling a pothole in your neighborhood street. This is investment that has to go towards our interstate highway system, our national highway system, the roads that connect our airports, our ports, and those highways that make justintime delivery possible. So, these are the major roads. And just to give you an idea of how important that national system is to our entire economy, over half of all the seaborne cargo in the United States comes through two ports: the port of Los Angeles and the port of Long Beach. Now, about 23 percent of those goods are going to stay in Southern California. But the rest of them are shipped to every state in the country. They go by rail. They also go by truck. And in this country, over 70 percent of all our freight is shipped by truck, so that national system is absolutely essential to getting goods and services across our country into the economy that we have. The federal program is extremely important as well, because it ensure that states are making investments in that national system. Twentyfive percent of the roads in this country are eligible for federal aid for the program that we're talking about that's supported by the federal gas tax. But those roads carry 85 percent of our total traffic. And in terms of how states are spending their money, the Government Accountability Office did a study last year, where they looked at state program spending of their federal dollars. Ninety percent of the money was going towards capital outlays and safety improvements. And capital outlays are construction, right of way, and engineering. So, states are making significant investments. And they get to choose which projects  where their money is going. The federal gas tax is also a sustainable revenue source over the next 10 to 20 years. Now, total volume of traffic in this country is going to be growing by about 1 percent a year. That's the forecast from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Now, while cars are becoming more fuelefficient, overall, what matters for the federal gas tax and the money raised is the total volume of fuel that we're consuming in this country. So, even though cars are becoming more fuel efficient, people are driving more. So, those two things are going to offset each other. And the forecast is that our fuel consumption, while it is going down, it's by about half a percent to 1 percent a year. So, that is a very manageable small change. We're not going see wild swings in fuel consumption because of more fuel efficient cars, even though our fleet is turning over gradually. When you look at state spending on all of those capital outlays I mentioned, which, again, construction, right of way, and engineering  federal money accounts for, on average, 52 percent of that spending. The federal aid program is absolutely crucial to what is actually getting designed, what is getting built, and all those right of way purchases to make those roads and those widening projects happen. And in some states, it is as high as 80 percent. And we have done the work where we look at those audited statements in the state budgets. Some states take their federal money  which, there's an 80/20 match. They match it, and that is their entire capital program. Even states like California and Texas, that we're talking about tonight  and again, we have done these reports. Nearly half of all the construction spending in those states, for highways and bridges, comes from the federal aid program. And you think about how important those states are to our economy. That federal investment is key. And right now, this is  and that's why the structure of the federal program is so important, because states have to invest money on those key corridors that are part of that national economy  those roads that are carrying 85 percent of our traffic, that are getting goods from the port of LA or Seattle, or New York, to all the store shelves where we go to buy the latest gadgets. And we are in danger. If we do not raise the federal gas tax, we are not investing enough  as my partner describes. And we are going to leave a system for future generations that is an economic drag, that's not fair. We've inherited a great system. And we owe it to our children and the next generation that we make the investments, and that we pay for them  that we're not bonding and using debt, and we're using a straightforward way, increasing the user fee to pay for the system. And I would also add that people really value their mobility in this country. We did some polling last year. They were not asking the right questions. It's not, Do you want to pay more in a gas tax? It's what are the benefits? What are you getting out of that investment? And we found that 75 to 80 percent of Americans told us that they value their mobility and their transportation system as much as their cell phone, their internet, their electricity, things that we use every day and that we just can't imagine living without. But there's a disconnect for folks understanding exactly what they pay for it. And for that reason, and many others as we've described, we urge you to support raising the gas tax so we can make those needed investments to help support our economy."

    "data": "Well, I, too, thank all of you for coming out. We really appreciate it. I got to start with Shailen's quote. I am often asked in these interviews to say, Well, what does the other side say? And that quote was exactly what it said. What does the other side say? I say They say you either raise taxes or you let the roads go to hell. So it wasn't actually a quote from me, but I have never advocated that solution. [laughs] But, you know, look, the one thing we all agree on is that this infrastructure is crucial. It's economically indisputable that it's central to  to our economy. I mean, if  if it wasn't for transportation, we would all be making our own clothes, growing our own food. You know, it'd be subsistence living, right? So transportation is crucial. The debate here is, is the best way to fund the transportation we need in the future to just simply tax people for more money to go into the existing system or is it to figure out if we're making the best use of the money? And really, what Steve and I are arguing is that we think there's a lot that can be done with the money that's already being taxed before we have to raise those taxes. You know, we all  look there's a lot of poster children for this problem. The bridge to nowhere probably being the single most famous one. You know, when you  the  when the system of allocating money is politicized, you will inevitably get money spent on projects that don't make a wit of sense. And that's not what happens to most of the money, but it only takes a little bit of that before people start to question the legitimacy of the money that's already there, let alone the legitimacy of giving more money into a system that builds bridge to nowhere. There is a  a fundamental question, I think, of, are we getting the bang for the buck that we should be getting from these systems? And I think it's also important to realize how much our priority for transportation has changed. If you look at state budgets from the 1960s, you'll see not only were they collecting gas taxes and were there federal gas taxes being spent to build the interstate system still in the '60s, but still under construction, but large chunks in every state of general fund revenues went to transportation. At that point in time, states were funding far fewer things, and transportation was considered very important. That's long gone. Starting about 25 years ago, states basically eliminated most of their general fund spending on transportation and started relying more and more on the federal government to give them the money for their local and state projects rather than funding it themselves. Which is more of a problem today because so much of what we need now that the interstate system is largely built out, is new projects that are primarily state and local in nature. Steve mentioned this as well. They may carry some interstate traffic, but on every interstate in America, most of the traffic is local. Most of the benefits of any new project are local, and the side benefits are  are the national trade, the truck traffic that moves the cargo around the country. So why shouldn't the funding of those projects be at least predominantly local? It's not entirely local for a great many of these projects. The notion that it's easy to lobby the federal government to raise its gas tax and get the free money from Washington than it is to convince your own citizens to vote yes to on a gas tax has really taken over in a lot of states. And it engenders a culture of, why don't we have other people pay for the things that we need? There's a lot of ways to get more bang for the buck. You know, Steve just gave the CaliforniaTexas example, which there is sort of like a cottage industry of comparing California and Texas in lots of things. Having lived in California, I saw a lot of that. But just across the board, if you look at how much it costs each of the 50 states to maintain and build roads, there is it a huge spread where you've got the least efficient states are spending orders four or five, six times as much as the most efficient states. And the least efficient states are not trying to figure out what they're doing wrong. They're not  they just want more money. They're not trying to figure out how  how can we build roads for the same price that the 10 most efficient states are? There's none of that going on. And I publish a report every year that makes that comparison. And I ask the bottom 10 states, are you going to try to move into the top 10? And they just say, No, your report's bogus because you can't compare states. So, you know, on it goes. There are many ways, though, to get more bang for the buck. We see in Europe and Asia wide use of tolling and public private partnerships to sort of backfill the user pays principle that the gas tax served so well for so long. It's  it's  there are ways of building more with the existing revenue that we don't seem to want to touch very much in this country. Now, I will say Colorado relatively, in the top handful of states in terms of using those kind of tools. But the vast majority of states don't use those tools and therefore spend a lot more than they need to because it's easier to ask you for more money than it is to get more efficient. And finally, I think there's too much funding of things that people don't use. And there's a lot of ways to slice this, and I don't want to get into all of it right now. But you know, there's  there are real fairness issues. You know, a Prius uses exactly the same amount of road to do a 25mileaday commute as a Lincoln Town car does. But a Lincoln Town car is paying many multiples more in gas tax than that Prius is, but not getting any more benefit from it. So while there's many great things about Prius and electric cars, there is a problem that they are not paying for the roads that they're using with a gas tax system. And as that technology continues to advance, and as all of our cars get more fuel efficient, all of us are going to be paying less for using more roads that are more expensive to build. And that's not a sustainable system. We should be focusing more on the performance of the projects we build, not the political popularity of the projects we build, which tends to drive a lot of the allocation of resources, especially in Congress at the federal level, not so much at the state level where things are a little closer to the road, so to speak. And Steve mentioned the disparate problem of transit spending. I can't break that all down, but let's just say that the bottom  the 20 percent poorest population in the U.S. is much more  many more of them get to work by bumming a ride from a friend who has a car than by riding transit. People in New York don't realize what an aberration New York is in terms of public transit  to the rest of the country."

    "data": "It's a pleasure to be here. I'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me and thank all of you folks for coming out to listen to us debate this issue tonight. Of course Peter and I are going to make the argument that China will be a longterm enemy of the United States. I want to start with two preliminary points. One is the argument here is not that we're destined to fight a war. It's that these two countries will be longterm enemies. You want to remember that during the Cold War the United States and Soviet Union were enemies, but they never fought a war thankfully, and we're not arguing that that is the case with regard to China. We're just saying they're going to be enemies. Second, when you talk about the future, there's no way you can talk about it without a theory of international politics or a theory of great power politics. And the reason is we have no evidence about the future because the evidence isn't there because the future hasn't happened yet. So you need a theory to explain what you think is going to happen and that theory, of course, has to be able to explain past cases where great powers rose and fell, and it has to be applicable to the present as well. So the division of labor between me and Peter this evening is that I'm going to lay out the simple theory that explains why China and the United States are destined to compete with each other, to have an intense security competition that involves arms races, crises, proxy wars and so forth and so on. And then what Peter's going to do when he follows me, is he's going to show you all the evidence that's already out there that supports the story that I'm going to tell you. My story basically goes like this: If you look at the international system the way it's organized, there are three characteristics of that system that force states to compete for power and to pursue greater and greater increments of power. The first characteristic of the system is that there is no higher authority that sits above states. There's no night watchman. States are like pool balls on a table. That means that if a state gets into trouble, there's nobody it can turn to rescue. As I like to say to students, In the international system, when you dial 911, there's nobody at the other end. That means it is, in effect, a selfhelp system. That's characteristic one. Characteristic two is that all states have some offensive military capability, and there are invariably a few states that have a lot of offensive military capability. The third feature of the system has to do with intentions. It's almost impossible to divine the future intentions of other states because we don't even know who's going to be running China in five years or 10 years or 15 years. We don't know who's going to be running the United States in five, 10, or 15 years. What this means is that when you operate in a world where there's no higher authority you can turn to when you get into trouble, and you may end up next to a store  a country that's very powerful and has malign intentions, you quickly figure out that the best way to survive is to be very powerful. As we used to say, when I was a young boy in New York City playgrounds, you want to be the biggest and baddest dude on the block, not because you're malicious or you have bad intentions, but it's the best way to survive, because the more powerful you are, the safer you are. Now, what this means in practical terms is that states want to, number one, dominate their region of the world, and number two, they want to make sure they don't have a peer competitor. That means you want to make sure there's not another state in the system that dominates its region of the world like you do. Let's talk a little bit about the United States. The United States is the only regional hegemon in modern history. Most Americans don't think about this, but the Founding Fathers and their successors went to enormous lengths to ensure that we would dominate the Western hemisphere. That involved conquering huge swaths of territory and making sure that the power gap between us and Mexico and us and Canada, us and Brazil, us and Guatemala, was enormous so that they could not cause us any trouble. Second thing we did was we instituted the Monroe Doctrine. We basically threw the European great powers out of the Western hemisphere and told them that they were not welcome back in here, because we did not want any distant great powers coming into the Western hemisphere. That was all about establishing hegemony in the Western hemisphere. Second goal, which is reflected in U.S. foreign policy in the 20th century, is to make sure we do not have a peer competitor. There were four potential peer competitors in the 20th century: Imperial Germany, Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union. The United States played a key role not only in making sure each one of those countries did not dominate either Europe or Asia, but also played a key role in putting all four of those countries on the scrapheap of history. The United States does not tolerate peer competitors. And the United States, to go back to my first point, is deeply committed to dominating the Western hemisphere. Now let's talk about China. As China gets more and more powerful  and that's going to happen  the question you have to ask yourself is what will China do with all that military power? My argument is that China will imitate the United States. They'd be crazy not to. They're going to try to dominate Asia the way we dominate the Western hemisphere. If you're in Beijing and you're a national security adviser, don't you want a China that is much more powerful than all its neighbors? The Chinese understand full well what happened the last time they were weak. They call it the century of national humiliation. They know what the Japanese, the Americans and the European great powers did to them, so they want to be very, very powerful, and for good reason. And they're going to want to push the United States out of the  East Asia. They'd be crazy not to. As my mother taught me when I was a little boy, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. If we can have a Monroe Doctrine, why do you think they're not going to have a Monroe Doctrine? So China's going to try to dominate Asia. Then the question becomes, what do you think the United States is going to do? The historical record is very clear here. We don't tolerate peer competitors. We're not going to let them dominate Asia if we can prevent it. In effect, this is what the pivot to Asia is all about. We see them rising, and we want to maintain our dominant position in Asia. The end result of this is the Chinese are going to push in one direction, and we're going to push in the other direction, and it is going to be an intense security competition. Again, this is not to say we're going to have a war. But the Chinese are going to do this not because they have a voracious appetite for tromping on people or if they have a particular aggressive gene. It's because the best way to survive in the international system is to be a regional hegemon. They understand that, and at the same time we're not going to let it happen."

    "data": "Well, thanks to all of you for coming out tonight. Remember that our motion is that the United States and China are longterm enemies, are now and will remain enemies. The motion is not that the United States and China may become enemies in the future. Bear the wording of the motion in mind. It's very important. Our opponents' position is that the United States and China are now and have no real option except to continue to remain enemies. Why? Because a social science theory says that nations base their strategies on a survivalist ethic. Even though the question the United States and China face is not how to survive, but how to flourish. We're reduced to our basest instincts. The dire outcome that our opponents are forecasting tonight is avoidable for reasons that Kevin and I are going to spell out. And it's also avoidable because the Chinese read Mearsheimer, ardently. They’ve read this theory. An even though he tells them that seeking hegemony in the Eastern hemisphere is a good idea, that there are sound strategic reasons, he goes on to describe a world that would ensue that no one in China or the United States would desire. In fact, he just admitted that when someone does what he tells China to do, the United States throws you on the scrapheap of history. This is a world we can avoid if we manage the relationship wisely. I am going to demonstrate that for the past 37 years, despite our disparate values, despite crises, despite a relationship that is already highly competitive, the U.S. and China have avoided enmity and have benefited from engagement. We are not enemies now. Our opponents don't even claim that we are, in contradiction to the motion. I will show you also that the world  what the world would look like in our own opponents' scheme if we were to become enemies, in hopes of convincing you that we should expend every effort to avoid that outcome. Kevin will then challenge the predictive reliability of the social science model in question, and he will demonstrate that despite serious threats to the relationship, the United States and China have the motive and the means to contain our competition within peaceful boundaries. Enemies, talking about enemies tonight. Fundamentally hostile powers who wish each other ill. For enemies, the prospect of war is always in the foreground of a relationship, although not all enemies fight. I want to emphasize from the beginning that the threat of enmity between the United States and China is real and it is not yet clear that we are going to have the wisdom to avoid this outcome. Our opponents have done a wonderful job of putting  of raising this alarm in very stark terms. But we do have to note that we are not enemies now, despite our current concerns. The U.S. is not containing China's rise. In fact, we have promoted that rise. We have aided and abetted it. The record of engagement with China is lopsided. China benefits more than we do, but we benefit as well. Trade. China is our third largest export market after Canada and Mexico. The China market is essential to the work of American corporations and the Americans they hire; Apple, G.M., Qualcomm, Intel, IBM, Proctor & Gamble, CocaCola, Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the import of cheap goods from China was one of the key factors that helped lowincome Americans to weather the storms of the 2008 financial crisis. China now invests in the United States. Cumulative foreign direct investment 54 billion, which puts 80,000 Americans to work. 7.3 million Chinese tourists will have visited here by 2021, bringing 85 billion annually. We benefit from trade. We also benefit from Chinese talent. Over 2 million Chinese students have studied here since the opening in 1979. And many of them have remained to contribute to our society. Over two million Chinese immigrants now live in the United States. It is the third largest foreign born group after Mexicans and Indians. And they contribute greatly to every aspect of the society. Ten ChineseAmericans have won Nobel Prizes as United States citizens – I’m sorry, 10 Chinese immigrants. Five of them were born in China. There's a friend of mine at the Heritage Foundation, Mr. Brookes's organization, a couple of years ago who said, United StatesChina relations are not just political, economic, and military, they are now personal. The Chinese have become our friends, neighbors, colleagues, coparishioners. It may seem like a cheap move to bring the personal element into this debate about international affairs, but it's actually an essential point. There is scant mention of individual wellbeing in John's theory. Nation states are the fundamental players in his anarchic world. But it is individual human beings that are imperiled by this contest for dominance. What does enmity look like? What would it be like to have China as an enemy? John Mearsheimer himself provides the answer in the final chapter of The Tragedy of Great Power Politics. He says that even if we avoid fullscale war, which would be Armageddon, we will face crises, major disputes that threaten war; an arms race, which I don't think we can afford; proxy wars, in which third country citizens will die for our purported benefit; bait and bleed strategies to lure the other country into costly foolish wars; bloodletting strategies to prolong those conflicts. The U.S. will begin barring Chinese students from its universities and we'll cut down travel restrictions. That's just a partial list. Enmity would also involve a betrayal of America's professed values. Why? As John Mearsheimer says, the United States' interests would be best served by slowing Chinese growth rather than accelerating it. He advocates that we harm  deliberately harm the welfare of one fifth of humankind to maintain our position as the hegemon. Our opponents say that we are now and will remain long term enemies because of a theory and because of Chinese intentions and capabilities which dictate that it must be so. This is their idea. We should answer them  we must answer them as Ebenezer Scrooge answered the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come in his dementor’s cloak, pointing a bony finger at a grave. Scrooge said, Are these the shadows of things that will be or are they the shadows of things that may be only? Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which if persevered in they must lead. But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is thus. The message that Kevin and I bring tonight is that it can be thus and it must be. That is why you must vote against the motion tonight, again, that the United States and China are now and are going to remain longterm enemies. Our opponents are correct about the gravity of the challenge. That's why we're having this debate here tonight. But we do have choices about how we meet and manage those challenges, choices that Kevin will soon elucidate for you. Thank you."

    "data": "My colleague, John, did a great job of developing a framework about how great powers act, and unfortunately it's not a happy story. I'm  my job here tonight is going to give  in the first opening, my opening statement is to give some texture and context to what   the paradigm that  as  that paradigm that John set up as it relates to China and the United States. In my opinion, China and the United States are strategic competitors, they're strategic rivals, and they're even enemies. The rhetoric itself bears this out. If you listen to the Chinese, they say that the United States is trying to encircle or contain China, the U.S. is an hegemon, a dominant power, which has a very strong negative connotation, the U.S. wants to prevent China's rise  this is coming out of Beijing  the U.S. feels  and you see this in commentators here in the United States  that China is trying to push the United States out of Asia, that China wants to replace the United States as the preeminent power in the Pacific as the number one world power. Both sides agree that there's a very high level of strategic distrust between the United States and China. It gets worse. The United States and China share important interests in several global hotspots or flashpoints. The oldest, of course, is Taiwan, not getting a lot of press lately, things have been quiet, but China says it's part of the People's Republic of China. The United States says don't try to change the status quo by force. China refuses to renounce the use of force, and the world  the U.S. would probably resist China trying to unify Taiwan with China using force. This is unlikely to be resolved any time soon. It's been ongoing since 1949, and it's certainly going to remain a point of tension between the United States and China. Another old one is the Korean Peninsula. Most people don't think about this. China and the United States fought there during the Korean War. China backs North Korea, its ally. The U.S. backs South Korea, its ally. War on the Korean Peninsula, in my estimation, is possible at any time. If you talk to U.S. forces Korea their motto is ready to fight tonight, and that's a possibility, especially when you're dealing with the leadership up there in North Korea. And if there is a fight there, it would likely involve the United States and China. The most recent flashpoints are the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Let me start with the East China Sea. The PRC, the People's Republic of China, has a territorial dispute in the East China Sea with American ally, Japan. The U.S. says that these islands, known in Japan as Senkaku, known in China as the Diaoyu, or the Diaoyutai, are under Japan's administration, quote unquote, and that they fall under the U.S. Japan defense treaty. That means that the United States could intervene if China decides to aggress against these Japanese islands. To make this issue tenser, China has declared an air defense identification zone, an ADIZ, over the East China Sea that includes these islands. And right afterwards, the United States after China declared this ADIZ, the United States sent two B52 bombers through this ADIZ to  as a symbol of strength that  and to make a point to China about their declaration. In the South China Sea, China now claims 80 percent of that body of water. They say it's Chinese sovereign territory. By Beijing's measure, the South China Sea is essentially a Chinese lake. Chinese says that the sovereignty over that body of water and the islands in it are indisputable. To ensure this, they’re building islands on coral reefs and rocky outcrops. On those islands they're also building ports and air fields. Of particular interest is that on one of the islands the runway is 3,000 meters long. That's about 10,000 feet. Longer than any commercial aircraft would need for landing, but it will host any of China's military aircraft. The Pacific commander recently said that some of these air fields have revetments that are meant to house or hangar tactical fighters. The U.S. is concerned, to say the least. Seeding sovereignty rights to China could give Beijing the green light to control freedom of the seas and air in the South China Sea. Through the South China Sea flows 1.5  or I'm sorry, $5 trillion worth of commerce. Thirty percent of the world's seaborne commerce flows through the South China Sea, $1.2 trillion of that is American. Eighty percent of Japan’s, South Korea’s, and Taiwan's, both either allies or partners of the United States, 80 percent of their imported energy goes through the South China Sea. Some islands in territory that China claims belong to U.S. allies, such as the Philippines. In the coming weeks, the Pentagon has announced that they will sail American war ships through the disputed waters around these new islands. China isn't happy about that at all. While conflict over any or all of these scenarios is inevitable, both sides are bracing themselves for confrontation, crisis, and possibly conflict. Scholars on both sides of the Pacific are talking and writing about the whatif questions if crisis comes between the U.S. and China. Indeed neither side is beating their swords into plowshares. They're making new and better swords. China has an antiaccess aerial denial strategy  this is what the Pentagon calls it  to deter, delay, or deny U.S. intervention in the western Pacific. The U.S. has the air/sea battle, a strategy to defeat the antiaccess aerial denial strategy, although the United States that is  says that isn't directed at any one country. China's involved in a massive military modernization program, double digit increases in its defense budget over the last 25 years. Emphasis on power projection. They're building aircraft carriers. They've  they're sending their nuclear deterrent to sea in fleet ballistic missile submarines. They're building stealth fighters. They're exercising significant cyber warfare capabilities, including against the United States, and preparing to fight in space. The U.S. is countering with a Pacific rebalance. Sixty percent of American ships are going to the Pacific. The U.S. Army is growing its presence. Top U.S. weapons technology is being sent to the Pacific theater first. That includes F22s, littoral combat ships, the J35 strike fighter. None of this sounds very friendly, isn't it? That's because it isn't. It's clear that China and the United States are competitors, rivals, indeed enemies. This isn't going to change any time soon. It's a regrettable fact. I strongly recommend that you vote for this motion. Thank you very much."

    "data": "The proposition we're looking at tonight's a serious one. It's no ordinary proposition. Think about it. The proposition we're being asked to consider is that China and the United States are longterm enemies. Weigh those words carefully. These are important words. Longterm enemies, that they cannot escape from this condition of enmity. This is extreme language. Using the term enemy in international relations is something we rarely do, but not in this proposition. It's a term we should use with extreme caution. Think of the definition of what an enemy is. A country you are fighting a war against, the soldiers, et cetera of that country. Let us not gloss over the gravity of the language which is being employed in this proposition. It's not just words. It means something much more fundamental. What we intend to do tonight is to defeat this proposition on three grounds. One it is theoretically dubious; two, practically, as Robert has just demonstrated, it does not reflect the current reality, in all of its dimensions and in all of its complexity of the current U.S.China relationship; and three, it is dangerously determinist in the sense that it says to us all, we can't do anything about it. It's written in the skies. And that effectively is what John's theory of offensive realism says. John said before you needed a theory to explain what is going on because we can't predict the future. But then occurs the first fundamental logical step in his argument. That fundamental, logical step is as follows: He says that we should take, therefore, at face value, the proposition that a theory of international relations can be reliably predictive. Where is that mysteriously established? Is it written in the stars? No, it's not. It is simply an assertion. And in fact, if you look at the whole body of literature on international relations, there are as many people arguing against the proposition that you can be predictive about anything in the social sciences, let alone in politics, let alone in international relations, let alone a theory which says the United States and China are going to be and are now enemies. There is something that the scholars would describe, too, as overcoming physics envy. What do they mean by that? That there’s the hard sciences out there, the biological sciences, the physical sciences. They have predictive laws. We can use that method. And the social sciences devise the same sort of principles which can therefore predict human behavior. Well, pigs might fly. There is a huge body of counterevidence to that. But for this to be the foundational proposition of John's argument, that because he has a theory called offensive realism, international relations, it is, by definition, predictive of where the United States and China are and will be is of itself logically flawed. The second logical flaw in the argument is as follows: He said before that it is clear to us all that we cannot predict the future intentions of states. I think I've got that right, John. We cannot predict the future intentions of states. I then listened carefully to John list four separate predictions about China's attitude. China will want to demonstrate and demonstrate through its behavior its domination of East Asia, just like the U.S. did. That's a statement of intention. You then go on to say that they'll want to push the United States out of Asia. That's a statement of your conclusions about Chinese intentions. You have said they want to be original hegemon. That's a statement of Chinese intentions, and that we, the United States, won't want them to do that. That's a statement of American intentions. You cannot have your cake and eat it too, and say, we cannot predict a state's intentions and list four areas in which you are making those precise predictions. It's not just logically inconsistent, it's dangerous, because by being so predictive, it infers that conflict and war are somehow inevitable. That is not our proposition, not our proposition at all. I also have a theoretical premise. Some would say it's Marxist. Listen to this. Politics, international politics, is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong  the wrong remedies, so says Groucho Marx. When we look at the proposition which is before us, it is theoretically flawed. And as my colleague Robert has demonstrated, it doesn't bear any relationship to the complex reality which is unfolding in U.S.China relations, across politics, across commerce, and across peopletopeople engagement. But what I'm fundamentally concerned about is additional argument against this proposition, it is dangerously determinist. It says that we, through diplomacy or political leadership cannot affect an action. It is basically saying that international relations, we've now got the application of Calvinist predestination. It's all out there and we can't stop it. That's what offensive realism has as its core proposition. It's a bit like saying that Nixon and Mao had nothing to do through their individual diplomatic activity in changing the course of the future of U.S. China relations. Well, they did through leadership. It's arguing that Deng Xiaoping had no impact possibly individually on China's economic future, that that was somehow automatically written in the stars. That's wrong. Individual political leaders do make a difference. And so it goes on with others who have contributed to the U.S.China relationship. The point is this: There is nothing determinist about international relations. We decide on our futures between countries just as we decide upon our futures between ourselves. It is a matter of what the theorist would describe as human agency. We get to make the choice. And through our political leaders, we can choose to make a choice. An alternative approach is what I call constructive realism; not offensive realism, but constructive realism. Recognize the realist differences which exist between America and  and China; recognize that there are fundamental differences in the East China Sea, the South China Sea, over Taiwan, on cyber, in space, on human rights, but at the same time recognize that there are multiple domains of constructive engagement. How do you deal conjointly with the problem of North Korean nuclear proliferation? How do you deal now conjointly with the problems of terrorism in Central Asia which afflicts China as much as anybody else? How do we grow the global economy through our combined growth strategies? These are areas of constructive engagement which can build political capital over time and help us deal with the fundamental problems of the future in this relationship as well."

    "data": "Thank you. And welcome to the second most important debate happening in America tonight. It's a  it's a deep honor to be here, and I want to thank the organizers and also you, the audience, for coming. So, yes, one of my daughters is a college sophomore. The other just started law school. I'm very concerned about keeping our campuses safe from sexual assault. That's a goal that everyone on this stage shares. But the way to achieve that goal is not by having colleges conduct rape trials when they're incompetent to do it. I'm about to use some strong words. I wouldn't do it except that this is the reality, and we need to face it. As the result of campus sexual assault trials, actual rapists all over the country are going free to rape again, while innocent people  it's impossible to know how many. But I'm talking about people who haven't committed any sexual assault at all  are being found guilty and having their lives wrecked by an error ridden, unreliable process that's filled with conflicts of interest and violations of due process, all of it covered by a thick layer of nontransparency. Now, my partner, Jeannie, is going to cover the serious due process violations, so I'm going to talk to you about the basic competency and neutrality and transparency issues. But there's something extremely important to both Jeannie and me. I want to say it first, that this is not, for us, a debate between the rights of the accused versus the rights of the victim. An incompetent process produces errors on both sides. It's unfair to both victims and the accused. The errors run in both directions, and I will give you examples of those in a moment. But first, just some quick background on how we got to where we are today. In 2011, the federal government sent a letter to every college and university in the country telling them that if they didn't start trying rape cases they would lose hundreds of millions of dollars in defunding penalties, and forcing us to comply with a set of procedures dictated by the government, including, for example, lowering the standard of proof. Now, I'm sure this letter was well intentioned. But the problem is that college trials totally lack the necessary expertise, neutrality and transparency. Let me start with competence. The primary forensic tool in a rape case  you've probably heard of it  it's a rape kit. It's basically a medical forensic examination of the victim. Now, most college personnel don't even know what a rape kit is. Or say a woman believes she was the victim of a date rape drug. Say she was the victim. That kind of case requires a laboratory toxicology result. That's how you make that case. Most colleges do not run such laboratories and can't do that. A recent college rape case was decided by a panel of three judges, one person from engineering, one from food services, and one foreign exchange student. In another case, an accused male student was essentially acquitted not because he was found innocent, but because he broke down at the hearing and admitted his alcoholism problem. The woman accuser was stunned to see her rapist sitting in class with her the next week. At Stanford, the teaching manual for rape judges includes an article saying that if the accused act  if the accused acts as if he's the victim, that's an indicator of guilt. Another indicator of guilt is if he, quote, Acts logical and persuasive. This kind of  I'm not kidding. This kind of incompetent decision making is leading to miscarriages of justice of a kind you wouldn't imagine in America. And how about impartiality? In our courts, we have a process we've worked out for centuries to ensure that our judges and juries are disinterested, that they don't know the parties, don't know anybody who does know the parties, that they're not subject to rumors and pressures. In college rape trials, it's the opposite. These are people from the same community. They are subject to pressures. They sometimes know the parties. They sometimes know people who do know the parties. Athlete  athletic coaches decide if athletes committed rape. Students decide cases involving students. Now, again, these conflicts, they hurt victims and accused alike. In some cases, colleges have a huge incentive to sweep rape cases under the rug, to cover them up. And that can lead to guilty people being found innocent. In other cases, it's the opposite. Especially today, colleges are feeling a lot of pressure under threat from the federal government to show how seriously they take these cases and to make an example. And that can lead to innocent people being found guilty, to be expelled, and if their names leak out, to be branded with a stigma that they have no way to ever clear themselves of. Compare this to what happens when a murder takes place on a college campus. We don't hold campus homicide trials. We all expect the police, the DA, the FBI and the courts to take charge. Rape is a crime as serious as homicide. It's not like plagiarism or cheating on an exam. That's the kind of thing college disciplinary panels are good at. We should treat rape with the same seriousness as we do other major crimes. But worst of all, I haven't even gotten to the worst thing of all. What happens when the college rape trial works just the way it's supposed to work; when an actual rapist is found guilty? What happens next? Let me ask you a question. If you had proof that somebody in your neighborhood had committed an act of rape, what was the  what's the worst possible thing you could do? Here's the worst thing: Push that person out of your neighborhood, but never tell anybody else what happened. Keep his name confidential. That literally is what colleges do in these cases. They expel the student but keep his identity a total secret because the college process, unlike a court, has no transparency. It's all covered with confidentiality. And I can't stress how important this is. Some empirical studies out there have suggested that up to 90 percent of college rapes are being committed by fewer than 5 percent of college men, a relative handful of serial rapists, averaging over six rapes each. Yet colleges, when they catch these serial rapists, simply push them out of their neighborhood, leaving them free to commit sexual assault elsewhere, their secret kept safe within the college bureaucracy. That's why we need courts to handle these cases. Now finally, it's critical to acknowledge that the courts are far from perfect, the police are far from perfect. Too often in the past they have failed victims of sexual assault. We can do better. We have to do better. And in the end, it's not courts or colleges, one or the other. That's a kind of debating artificiality. We all know that both have a role to play. There's a huge amount colleges can do, but they should be focused on education and prevention, which they can do well, not on adjudication which they can't. Ideally, we bridge the gap. Get colleges and police working together. That's what I've advocated, and it's happening. Here in New York, there's just been the creation of a special sexual assault enforcement unit, first of its kind in the country. It's specifically designed to go out and work with both colleges and local police to help them get together and do their jobs better. But the primary responsibility for investigating and trying rape cases has to be with police and courts. That's what we're asking you to vote for. A vote for our side of this debate is a vote that not campuses, but courts should be the primary place where rape trials are conducted. And we urge you to vote that way."

    "data": "Courts should decide sexual assault cases when a victim reports to the police, when the police take it seriously and investigate, when a prosecutor takes it seriously and pursues it, and the case finally lands in a court of law. In these circumstances, courts should decide sexual assault cases. No one disagrees. The only thing this debate is about is between two commas, Not campuses. The resolution strips jurisdiction from campuses to also decide sexual assault cases. That's what we're talking about tonight. Now, colleges and universities exist to generate and transmit knowledge. And they cannot do that job unless they have a safe learning environment in which to do it. They also cannot single out sexual assault cases and push them to the criminal courts, unlike all the other cases they deal with, without harming the learning environment and without violating the civil rights of students. My colleague, Stephen Schulhofer will talk about the problems that happen when cases are pushed to the criminal law involuntarily. For now, I'll just note that there's a reason why 95 percent of sexual assault victims on campus never report to the police. They do not believe that justice will be served. A college student reported having been raped to the New York City police department. The officer scoffed. You invited him into your dorm room. That's not the legal definition of rape. Another officer chimed in. For every single rape I've had, I've had 20 reports that are total bullshit. That's not from 1970. That story is from 2014. The fact is that bias against victims of sexual assault has a welldocumented, 200 year history in the criminal justice system. But even when the system harbors no bias whatsoever, campuses must be able to decide sexual assault cases. Courts and campuses have different interests in these cases and different remedies. Let me explain. When a campus sexual assault happens, a victim needs immediate safety and protection. Campuses can take protective measures to ensure a safe educational environment; stagger classes, move someone from a dorm, issue reprimands, suspend students. These remedies are not available in the court. The university's role is unavoidable because campuses must preserve students' ability to learn. Since the early part of the 19th century, colleges and universities have always disciplined students independent of the criminal law. They've had to. Throughout time, students incite riots, they assault, they plagiarize, they harass. Some of these acts are criminal, some are not. But just to clarify, campuses are not prosecuting criminal charges in trials. They're pursuing violations of their own disciplinary codes, which do not lead to criminal convictions or imprisonment. And colleges cannot wait around to see if the police are interested in the case. Let me give you an example. In 2013 a college fraternity hazing ritual in Pennsylvania ended in the death of a pledge by blunt force trauma to the head. The coroner ruled the death a homicide, but the prosecutor did not pursue charges until Monday, almost two years later. Now, the university had an independent interest in the case. It pursued immediate disciplinary action against the students who hazed and killed the other student. And it suspended them. Now, fraternity hazing and homicide are serious crimes, just like rape is a serious crime, but no one in that case said, Oh, the courts should be the only one to handle the case. The colleges should get out of the way. Whether or not criminal charges ever emerge in a case, colleges must decide cases to maintain a safe learning environment, even more so with sexual assault. Title IX is a federal civil rights statute that prohibits gender discrimination in educational institutions. And campus sexual assault is a form of discrimination that denies a victim an equal education. Many sexual assault victims suffer serious consequences, depression, eating disorders, suicidal ideation, social withdrawal. These reactions impair their ability to attend class and focus, to pass their classes, to maintain their time in school, to remain in school. As a result, the United States Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights requires schools to take immediate and effective steps to end sexual violence. It requires equal treatment of accuser and accused and demands adequate, reliable, and impartial investigation of complaints. Since 2011, campuses have begun pursuing these cases in earnest. Most colleges are working to implement Title IX in a fair and equitable way. You don't hear about them. Some campuses are failing, however. They're either denying victims their rights under Title IX to an equitable education or they're actually violating students' due process during the disciplinary proceedings in ways that Title IX does not require and the Constitution will not stand. In these later cases, students are suing, as you heard. Where colleges have gone wrong, these young men are winning. And these process issues can be worked out intelligently through the courts without taking a meat cleaver to the problem and abolishing or cutting off campus jurisdiction entirely. Let's circle back to the differences between the criminal justice system and Title IX quickly. The criminal justice system is focused on punishment, incarceration, retribution. Title IX by contrast is a civil rights statute. And like most civil rights statutes, it's focused on equality, in this case, educational equality. The criminal justice system cannot insure equality, and it cannot remedy inequality. Campuses have to insure equality. They must provide a safe learning environment to generate and transmit knowledge. Now, I want to end by noting that this debate resolution is actually worse than the House Republican bill that is pending right now in Congress with the Orwellian title, The Safe Campus Act. That bill would prohibit campuses from investigating sexual assault unless the victim reports to the police, and it's being heavily promoted by fraternities. The bill has received near universal opposition from groups that work with actual sexual assault victims as well as opposition from many groups that represent colleges and universities, like the Association of American Universities. The American Council on Education has expressed grave reservation about any legislation that would limit our ability to insure a safe campus. The effect of this resolution is to eviscerate colleges' ability to insure a safe campus. It would also violate students' civil rights, and it has to be wrong. Please vote, No. Thank you."

    "data": "I think it's important for us to see that tonight's debate is not just about courts versus campuses. And it's not just about sexual assault. It is a debate about the equality of men and women in our society. In college, I was a rape counselor and an activist, and I've spent my entire life as a feminist on campuses. I have a daughter and a son. And I was optimistic to see colleges take sexual assault more seriously than they had in the past. But the disaster we have seen unfolding around us has made me lose faith. My points tonight will focus on fairness, process, and the connection to equality. What campuses are doing under pressure from the Department of Education is hurting the cause of gender equality. Campus tribunals use procedures that lack basic fairness and often reach inaccurate outcomes. What happens? You're told there's a sexual misconduct complaint against you. But they don't say what it's about or show you the complaint. They don't tell you the evidence or the facts that they're gathering, who the witnesses are, or what they've said. If you're allowed to bring an attorney, which you might not be, your lawyer is barred from speaking. If they give you a live hearing, which they may not, you can't question the accuser or witnesses. People who weren't even there are asked to give opinions on what happened. Terribly leading questions are asked. And when your attorney objects, she is told that if she speaks again, she'll be ejected. After you're found responsible and suspended, they don't give you a copy of the investigative report, saying that they can't because of student privacy. The investigation and the adjudication may be handled by the same person, and the appeal is to that person's boss. So, everyone is invested in defending the previous actions of the school. When you appeal, you're told you can't challenge the panel's factual findings. And all this is happening because if you're not found guilty, the school fears that the Department of Education will open an investigation that would cost a lot of money to deal with and jeopardize its federal funding. In just the past three months, no fewer than five different courts have ruled for students on claims that their school used unfair procedures, including things that I've just described. The shocking disregard for what Americans know are essentials of fair process deeply harms the cause of taking sexual violence seriously. It reinforces society's skepticism toward rape victims. It causes everyone to doubt that men disciplined for sexual assault are actually guilty. That aggravates the serious problem that we all want to address. And it harms the fight for gender equality. To make matters worse, many schools are now stretching the concept of what sexual assault is far beyond reasonable recognition. If you have sexual contact without an explicit agreement for every stage of a sexual interaction, that might be considered nonconsensual. It's a great idea to make sure that each partner is excited about going forward, but move from kissing to touching without pausing for an explicit agreement  and it can be sexual assault, even if the other person is equally participating in it. Some schools even define consent to mean not only affirmative, but enthusiastic  even creative and imaginative agreement. It may be funny, but anything else is sexual assault. It's obvious that sex with a person incapacitated by alcohol is rape. That is obvious. But schools are now disciplining students when the sexual contact is under the influence of alcohol. All this means that most sexual encounters are violating the rules. So, when one person is kicked out for this and branded a rapist, it feels arbitrary to both men and to women. It is truly bizarre to lump these cases together with rapes and treat them as sexual assaults. Yet, these are most of the cases that colleges are adjudicating today. This came about because of a desire to protect women from coercion. The idea was that men should seek permission, not just wait for women to object to sex. But schools are sending all the wrong messages about women's capacity to be equal, mature, and independent. We can date these ideas to about 1880. Women are timid; women are fragile. In the name of protecting college women and making campuses safe, schools are signaling loudly that they do not see women as capable. I don't want my daughter educated to think of herself that way. We need to refocus on what's wrong with sexual violence and refuse these ancient ideas of women's incapacity. Watereddown procedures and overly broad definitions of nonconsent make a mockery of a very serious problem and dishonor victims. Our opponents must convince you that a rape on campus is different from a rape anywhere else. It is not. Criminal sexual conduct anywhere deserves criminal response. And our opponents want you to accept that a civil rights option means that it's okay to have lesser procedures. Even if the stakes were civil, the process must be fair, and the stakes are effectively criminal. There is, in fact, so much that campuses should do. It's disturbing to see the bulk of resources going to pseudo investigations and trials. Schools should direct those resources to working with law enforcement. The safety measures that Michelle was talking about, those do not necessarily go hand in hand with an investigation and adjudication, a decision about the responsibility and guilt of a party for committing a crime. You can take safety measures, and campuses do all the time, without having pseudo criminal trials. Schools can engage in rape education, they can address alcohol consumption, and they can work hard to support victims. The answer to shame or stigma about sexual assault is not a campus tribunal mired in secrecy and severe conflicts of interest that is the confidence of nobody. We're going to look back on this period as a mass panic when many people together lost their ability to think clearly about sexual assault and squandered opportunities for promoting gender equality. Campuses should not do shoddily what our courts have been designed over generations to do; decide questions of responsibility and guilt for a crime based on evidence. You should not accept it. You should vote for the motion. Courts, not campuses should decide sexual assault cases."

    "data": "Thank you very much. Courts are certainly finding due process violations all over the place. A lot of colleges have really botched this problem. But I'm very surprised to hear professor Suk cite that as a reason for precluding campus discipline in all these cases. We don't shut down the criminal courts just because appellate courts are finding due process violations in criminal trials. And that happens a lot. So, these decisions show that the system is working. The Department of Education has overreached. Many colleges have overreached, and courts are pushing back. The question we have to decide  and we all agree that many colleges have done a very poor job. The question that we're debating is whether to fix the problem by requiring the colleges to do better or whether to prevent all campuses from deciding these cases no matter how careful they are. The resolution would make a criminal complaint the victim's only option, even when she doesn't want to go through the stress of the criminal process herself and even when she doesn't want to impose that on a classmate who may have mistreated her, but she doesn't want to see that classmate convicted of a crime. Taking away the option of a campus remedy is obviously bad for sexual assault victims. I don't think there's any possible question about that. And what people are missing here is that sending all these cases to the criminal courts is going to work out very badly for the accused students as well. Suppose a student claims that one of her classmates pushed her onto a sofa, ignored her protests and penetrated her? If a campus panel accepts her story, her classmate might be suspended or even expelled. That could have lifealtering consequences. But expulsion is nothing compared to the impact of a criminal conviction for a sex offense. The resolution seems to assume that a criminal conviction requires very clear proof. The reality is actually not so reassuring. Trial lawyers know that proof beyond a reasonable doubt isn't all it's cracked up to be. Victim testimony no longer requires any corroboration or any proof of physical coercion. If the complainant testifies that she said no, and the jury believes her, that's enough. That is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Of course, the jury has to be unanimous to convict. But it also has to be unanimous to acquit. That's one reason why prosecutors typically file multiple charges, from rape down to sexual contact, attempted contact and maybe a few more. So some jurors may have doubts, others don't. And you typically see a compromised verdict. Jurors convict on a minor charge, not even realizing that their verdict can still trigger a harsh sentence. But it gets worse. Most criminal cases end in a plea bargain. And one reason is that a rape conviction can mean more than 15 years in prison. If the prosecutor will accept a plea to attempted rape or sexual contact, the sentence drops to only a year or two in jail. That's a hard offer to refuse, even if the chance of conviction on that top count is only 20 or 30 percent. So technically, you can't get a criminal conviction on a mere preponderance of the evidence. But if the odds of a 15year sentence are 50/50, that becomes a pretty strong reason to plead guilty to the lesser offense. And bingo, the student who might have faced discipline in a college proceeding, might have been required to change his dorm or even leave school for a semester. That student is now getting jail time and a criminal record without having any court hear any evidence at all. That's the reality for the great majority of cases in our criminal courts. What about less serious cases? Suppose a young man stares at a sophomore in his calculus class, and he keeps making comments about her body? One day, he grabs her butt in the hallway outside of class. That is sexual assault. But sending a contact case like that to the police normally means complete inaction. I hope that's not the resolution's hidden agenda, a world where a lesser sexual assault allegations aren't pursued. But anyone supporting the allegation for that reason is going to get a rude surprise if it were adopted, because if DAs didn't pursue these cases, which is what usually happens now, how can colleges respond to disruption and sexual harassment? It's not clear to me what the supporters of this resolution have in mind. When you put thousands of adolescents together with raging hormones, poor judgment and easy access to alcohol, some of them are going to be rude and aggressive. You can talk about prevention programs, and I'm in favor of them too. But misconduct in that environment is going to happen. And how exactly is a college supposed to respond to stupid, boorish behavior, which is going to happen? Could the college suspend the student for his rude comments because that's not a crime, but not be allowed to suspend him for actually groping her? It doesn't make any sense. But otherwise, unless the DA pursues the case, there couldn't be any sanction at all. And if the college can't discipline its students directly, it will have to pressure police and local prosecutors to press criminal charges. So students who would never face the criminal courts today, adolescents guilty of immaturity and poor judgment would find themselves with a criminal record. No one should want that. But colleges will have to insist on prosecution because they'd have no other basis for imposing sanctions. I think professor Suk said, well, of course, the college can take some action. But does that mean the college is going to be taking action without deciding what happened? That's a kind of odd situation if you're opposing  if you're supporting the resolution that colleges can't decide these cases, but they can take action without deciding the case, that's even worse than the situation we have now. And I haven't even mentioned sex offender registration. Federal statute called SORNA establishes a national registry with a current address, place of employment and photograph of every convicted sex offender. And it's readily available on the internet, and it's a federal felony for a sex offender to fail to notify local police within three days of every change in residence. People assume these laws only apply to predators who abuse little children, but they cover all sex offenses, even lowlevel misdemeanors. So this resolution would be a disaster, not only for colleges, but for accused students. They would get less due process in the criminal courts, and we'd see more convictions with consequences far more severe than a college disciplinary record. So that's why it's very important to vote against this resolution. Thank you."

    "data": "So I'm arguing for the proposition that ISIS must be defeated. ISIS is more than a terrorist organization. It is a proto‐state, an ideological movement that is committed to undertake Jihad against anyone who rejects its abhorrent ideology. Its ultimate aim is to establish a territorial caliphate that stretches across the Muslim world. ISIS is brutal in the extreme. It has beheaded innocent civilians. It has burned a captured Jordanian pilot alive in a cage. It rapes women and girls and sells them into sexual slavery. It crucifies Christians. It desecrates and destroys Holy sites and antiquities. Over the last year ISIS has established a very substantial safe haven in Iraq and Syria, and it has recruited more than 22,000 foreign fighters from more than 100 countries. The scale and scope of this mobilization is unprecedented. Thousands of these fighters have Western passports that would allow them to travel back to Europe and to the United States without a visa. ISIS ‐‐ its geographic ambitions are not limited to the Middle East. This is a globalizing movement. In the last year ISIS has sought to establish footprints in places from Libya to Afghanistan, Nigeria, the Caucasus, even Southeast Asia. Holding territory is critical to its momentum and its legitimacy. It has also established a global presence on the internet using online means to disseminate its propaganda, recruit and radicalize followers, inspire lone‐wolf attacks. Again, the scale is eye‐watering. 90,000 social media messages each day. 90,000 a day. In some ways, ISIS could become more dangerous than Al‐Qaeda. Al‐ Qaeda used to assert very strict control over who became an affiliate. ISIS says, Let a thousand flowers bloom. If we can inspire individuals to conduct attacks around the world, that's great. In fact, 10 of the 11 attacks conducted in the West since May of 2014 have been by lone wolves. ISIS has also conducted attacks not only in the Middle East, but in Canada, Australia, France, Denmark, and yes, here in the United States. In all 50 states today, there are active investigations or arrests of ISIS. If ever there was a terrorist group that we must defeat, it is ISIS. Now, defeating ISIS will require an intensive ‐‐ more intensive and fully resourced campaign on the part of the United States and our international partners. We need to intensify our diplomacy and our military support to Sunni and other partners so that they can be empowered to defeat ISIS on the ground. Politically, that means we need intensified diplomacy to press the Shi'a government in Baghdad, to address Sunni grievances, to devolve more authorities and resources to the provinces, to move towards a more federal and just Iraq. In Syria, we need a more robust diplomatic effort to set the conditions for what should eventually become a negotiated settlement that removes Assad from power. We need increased international engagement to try to keep the civil war in Syria from destabilizing neighboring states, like Jordan, and Lebanon, and Turkey. Militarily, in Iraq we need to provide more support, trainers, combat advisers, equipment, close air support, to local partners on the ground who can take on ISIS and take back territory. To be clear, I am not ‐‐ we are not arguing for a large‐scale U.S. military invasion of Iraq. We are not calling for a repeat of the Iraq War. We are calling for intensified support to partners. In Syria ‐‐ we need to shift our emphasis to producing more support to some of the groups that are already having success on the ground, like the Southern Front and the Syrian Free Army. We also need to refashion our Train and Equip program to try to get towards the goal of a more viable alternative to ISIS in a post‐Assad Syria. Thinking globally, we also need to combat ISIS using the full range of tools that we've developed for counterterrorism, disrupting their financing, targeting their leadership, building their capacity of partners in other countries to try to keep ISIS from moving in. We need to work with private sector and NGO partners to combat them online. And we need to address some more fundamental conditions that create fertile soil for ISIS, such as poor governance and community grievance. This will not be without risk. But I would argue, the risk of inaction are even greater. The other team will argue that containment is a better option. I will tell you that containment won't work. Containment means allowing ISIS to hold on to sanctuary. It means ISIS will be able to continue to plan attacks, recruit followers, inspire lone wolves. Containment would be a recipe for endless terrorist attacks in the West and instability in the Middle East. Is that a future we really want? It's not a future I want my children to live in. If there's anything we should have learned from 9/11, it is that we must not allow a terrorist organization like this to have sanctuary in the heart of the Middle East or elsewhere. Now is the time to do more, to act with our partners, to defeat ISIS. Thank you."

    "data": "So, I want to see the end of ISIS as much as anyone does. No one can watch the horrible things they do and not think that this is a terrible, terrible scourge and threat. And we have to end it. The question on the table is, What is the best strategy to achieve that goal for the United States? That's what we're debating. What is the best strategy for us? Now, our opponents are already fudging that question. Because the debate here is, do you use military force to drive them out of the territory they hold or do you contain them where they are? And so, what you're hearing is they can't have sanctuary. Michèle Flournoy said very clearly ‐‐ they cannot have a sanctuary. Okay? What they have to convince you of is they have a strategy for how the United States can deny them ‐‐ can deny ISIS ‐‐ that strategy. So, let's just be very clear about what's on the table here. They have to convince you they have a strategy for the United States to drive ISIS out of that sanctuary, and somehow magically, without boots on the ground. But I'll leave that to them. So, they have to tell you what defeat is and how the U.S. can achieve it. Here's what we mean by containment. We mean stopping ISIS where it is. We mean critically breaking their narrative of victory. We all heard from Professor Haykel, who Bob Rosenkranz mentioned. He said, Look, what is essential is that every time ISIS wins, they convince their supporters God is on their side. All right. It is a kind of end‐of‐days, millenarian ‐‐ This is it. We're going to restore the caliphate. We're going to spread it across the world. And see, God is on our side because we have just taken another city. So, containment says you break that. You do not let them expand their territory and you do everything you can to stop the flow of recruits. So you stop them where they are. So, that's containment. It's not a do‐nothing strategy. In fact, it's doing everything possible, and certainly, diplomatically everything possible. Digitally everything possible. In ‐‐ and militarily, stopping them from expanding where they are. It may also mean supporting our allies and friends in the Middle East to the extent they take the lead in wanting to push ISIS back. So that's containment. We're going to stop them where they are. We're going to let their internal contradictions show themselves. We're going to let ultimately, as we have done before, for the older members of this audience ‐‐ we're going to let the ideology crumble itself. The alternative is roll‐back. Right? The alternative, as I said, is going in there and actually pushing them out of that territory. And I'm going to leave it to my partner, the brilliant Dov Zakheim. He's going to talk about why that's so hard militarily. But what I want to do is talk about why that won't work, why roll‐back won't work politically. And the first thing to say is we've seen this movie before. General Petraeus was on the stage two days ago, talking about how he had pushed Al‐Qaeda in Iraq out of Mosul. Al‐Qaeda in Iraq is not there, but guess who's back in Mosul? ISIS is there. This is Round 2. We have done this militarily before. That didn't work. And here's why, because it isn't just an idea. It is not just a military question. ISIS is an ideology. Professor Haykel said on the same stage that, of course, defeat is desirable. But how do you defeat a set of ideas? So, the way we've done this before, when we were up against an ideology ‐‐ for most of my life, that ideology was Communism. Containment was the most successful strategy the United States has ever pursued. And it didn't mean not doing anything. And we had to use our military. And we used our ‐‐ diplomatically. But we contained the Soviet Union and ultimately, we let its internal contradictions destroy it. So, it's happened before. And it'll come again. Equally ‐‐ or more troubling is that if we inject ourselves, we confirm their narrative. Right? ISIS's narrative is that they are fighting the crusaders ‐‐ that's us ‐‐ the Zionists ‐‐ that's the Israelis ‐‐ and the Shiites and the Sufis. So, the minute we put ourselves in there, we are confirming to them and everyone they want to recruit that this is indeed the millennial battle between the crusaders and the true defenders of Islam. We don't want to do that. The last reason that we need to pursue a containment strategy is this is a very long game. So, General Petraeus said two days ago ‐‐ and he was quoting General Odierno ‐‐ that this was a fight at least of a decade, if not a decade or two decades. So, 10 to 20 years. That's what are our generals are telling us now. That actually, I think, could be on the short side. So, remember your history and remember stories of monotheistic faith in which clerics had both political and religious power and were deeply, deeply corrupt and spawned a revolt that said you had to purify the church and ultimately that was the only way to reclaim the true religion. Obviously that's the Reformation. It was just decades, it was centuries. This is a deeply internal Muslim fight. It is a fight for the soul of Islam. It is not our fight. It is the Muslim's fight. In the end we have to protect ourselves. We have to contain it, but we cannot win it."

    "data": "Tough issue, but I want to start where Anne‐Marie Slaughter left off. She said injecting the United States into this conflict confirms their narrative. As if we're not injected already? As if we're not conducting air strikes against them every single day? As if we're not, as the Deputy Secretary of State has said, We've already killed 10,000 of their members, but it has not declined. In other words, we're already injected. We're already fighting, we're just not beating them. That confirms their narrative. That confirms their narrative of victory. Their crusaders attack us every day. That's the way they put it. And here we are controlling 20 cities, ruling millions of people, and enslaving more. Let's talk about what failure looks like. Sure, failure looks like hundreds or thousands of Americans dead after an attack that could come next month, next year, or the year after that. The 9/11 attack that I studied gestated for three years before they laid waste to southern Manhattan. The people who carried out that attack migrated from Germany to Afghanistan nearly two years before the attack. They went there, by the way, thinking that they were going to go fight Russians in Chechnya, but the leadership found other uses for them. So failure looks like hundreds or thousands of Americans dead with more violence in Europe, but failure also looks like the descent of the Middle East into the full war of extremes in which its all against all, in which its Shia extremists supported by Iran and Sunni extremists for whom ISIS is the terrifying sort of purity and Lebanon crumples and Jordan crumples and Turkey begins to crumple, all already awash with millions of displaced people. All are already failing to cope. Their societies already sagging under the weight of the burdens. Saudi Arabia destabilized as more and more Sunnis find that that's really the extreme version of their own ideology that they want to follow. Don't you think that that's the point that the U.S. has to reinvade the Middle East? That's failure. U.S. reinvasion of the Middle East is failure. That's the failure Michèle Flournoy and I are against. That's why you need to adopt this resolution and defeat ISIS so that we don’t have to reinvade the Middle East. What then does success look like? Success looks like defeating their message. What's their message? It's a message about power. We empower the weak Sunni Muslims and we empower them through the exclusive divine mission they hold and the terrifying sword they wield in the territory we rule, ruling despite the crusader's attacks against us. So what does success look like? It's Sunni Muslims liberating their own lands. It's Sunni Muslims recovering self‐determination. So what's the strategy to do that? It's a political strategy first and foremost, because the public debate in America is mostly about should we do more militarily. That's wrong. Michèle and I both believe, know the strategy leads politically and it needs to be a strategy that appeals to Sunni Muslims, because they're the ones we want to do most of the fighting to keep Americans from having to do most of the fighting later on. Why will they fight? They will fight to free themselves, to free themselves from the Assad tyranny in Syria where we also must join that fight and end the Syrian Civil War, which is destroying the region and bringing it close to the brink of apocalypse. That's the kind of message that appeals to Turkey and brings them in on our side and units Saudi Arabia and the Sunnis of Lebanon and the millions of Syrians in refugee camps who want to return to their homes. Because, you see, ISIS is not homegrown. ISIS are foreigners. The ISIS rulers in Syria are led by Iraqis and veterans of Saddam Hussein's gestapo and they recruit Uzbeks and Chechens to run their shock troops in Mosul. Many of the Iraqi recruits that they enslave into their service don't even understand the command language that they're hearing on the radio. So the political strategy is a self‐determination of Sunni Muslims. And the military strategy, advise and support so they can do the job, but it's a tough job. They have to retake cities. To do that kind of urban warfare requires just the kind of assets that only the United States has. Think about urban combat and what you need, armored vehicles that aren't going to be blown up by an IED as easily, jammers to diffuse the IEDs, snipers who can provide over watch, communication so that you know what's going on in the block two blocks away from you, medivac capabilities that give you the confidence your wounded can be treated and helicopters and fires that can be brought to bear on the targets you see in front of you. Those are assets only the United States can provide, which gives them the confidence and the sense that we're in this with them that allows you to build a coalition founded on Sunni Muslims doing the job to liberate their own lands, because containment doesn't keep the U.S. out. It guarantees the U.S. is likely to come in. Anne‐Marie said it at last. Let ideology crumble itself. Did the Khmer Rouge crumble itself? No, the Vietnamese had to invade Cambodia. Did the Taliban crumble itself? Did al‐Qaeda in Pakistan crumble itself? Has the North Korean tyranny crumbled itself? No. You have to beat terror with something else and in this case the something else is defeating terror where it has taken root in ISIS. Support the resolution."

    "data": "Thanks very much and I really want to thank Phil, because he just made my argument. We have armed ISIS. What do you think they're using? American personnel carriers. American tanks. American ammunition. Why? Because we've done such a fantastic job training the Iraqis and we've been doing it for over a decade, and we've done an equally good job training the Afghans. That's why they're doing so well. And in fact, if you look at who we've trained in Syria, we have a $500 million program that thus far has spat out 60 fighters, 60. That's less than that side of the room. Of which, and I hope this doesn't happen to any of you all, a whole bunch have already been captured. So let's step back and look at what it really takes to beat these folks and to do something other than to contain them the way my brilliant colleague, Anne‐Marie Slaughter ‐‐ laid out for you. You know, this isn't the first outburst of Islamic extremism. For instance, in the 12th Century there was a fanatical group that actually had the same ideology as these guys called the Almohads. And how were they defeated? By massive forces of Christian troops coming down from northern Spain. In the 18th Century, the original Wahhabis who had made a deal with the first [unintelligible], basically same kind of ideology. They were defeated by Turkish forces, and then we had the same sort of thing again in the late 19th Century when Lord Kitchener, then General Kitchener, amassed a huge force to defeat the Mahdi in Sudan. What's the common denominator? Lots of troops. Not a few thousand. Not a bunch of spotters, because oh, by the way, when the Israelis couldn't beat Hezbollah in 2006, they didn't have a problem with spotters. And when we tried to bomb Vietnam to the Stone Age in the 1960s, with Rolling Thunder, we didn't have a problem with spotters. Spotters aren't the issue. The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend the money to do that? We're living under a strange thing called a sequester. Somebody was asked on television, What's a sequester? And he answered, It's the capital of Portugal. People don't even know what a sequester is. But what it's done is limit our spending. And you talk to Secretary of Defense Carter and he rightly says he's being constrained all over the place. The president says it. So, where are we going to find the money ‐‐ even if we had the will, which I don't think we have ‐‐ to go and fund all these troops, or even to do what Philip says. All the things you want to give these folks ‐‐ let's assume they don't fall into ISIS's hands. Where are we going to find the money for it? Do we have the will? Do we have the money? Do we have the staying power for that kind of thing? The only way you're going to stop these guys is if, indeed, they rot from within. That's the only alternative if you're not going to send hundreds of thousands of troops in. And to get them to rot from within, you have to contain them. You've got to keep them cooped up. And there are ways to do that. But we're not even in one mind as to how to right now. Yes, we love the Kurds, but we don't arm them. Yes, we want to work with the Turks, except the Turks have a different agenda. They want to bomb the Kurds, who we like. I mean, you need a scorecard to figure out who exactly is on your side. How do you beat these people that way? The bottom line is ‐‐ unless we have a coherent major military strategy, the real alternative ‐‐ when you parse out all the stuff about what we can do right now, the real alternative is to keep them cooped up, to arm our friends, to figure out how to train those who will fight. And yes, the Sunnis might fight. But guess what? They haven't fought until now. We've been begging them for years. Saudi Arabia is fighting, except not in Syria, not in Iraq. They're fighting in Yemen. And they're not doing that hot a job there either. So, we have to figure out how to motivate those we want to work with us. And that's going to take time. And what do we do in the meantime? We've got to contain ISIS for as long as possible. And if we could beat the Soviet Union, I wouldn't bet the family farm against our beating ISIS."

    "data": "Well, thank you. And first I want to say it's a huge honor to be speaking opposite these really distinguished guests. I mean, Evan Wolfson, as they said, is the architect of the movement for samesex marriage. He's a remarkable visionary and leader whatever you think of the substance of the issue. And Kenji Yoshino it rightly regarded, including by lots of my conservative friends, as one of the best teachers in the legal academy and certainly one of the best writers. I think you'll see all of that on display tonight. And it would worry me, except that I think that you can be fully onboard with their view of samesex marriage as a policy matter and still agree with us that it's one of those very important policies where the Constitution's just silent. It leaves you free to pick. And the reason, in a nutshell  and I'm going to be focusing on big picture in this part  is that the Equal Protection Clause is not enough. It says don't be arbitrary. So have a reasonable vision of what marriage is and of its public purposes and apply it equally, not arbitrarily. It doesn't tell you what vision of marriage to adopt. But that's what this whole debate is exactly about. Do we adopt the consentbased view of marriage that says it's fundamentally about deep romantic love and commitment and that the reasons to recognize it are stability and dignity, in which case, yes, recognizing that equally requires recognizing samesex relationships. Or do we have a different vision of marriage? The more traditional vision in our law, the conjugal view of marriage that says marriage is fundamentally about that union in which a man and a woman are coming together and oriented to family life by the very nature of the bond, the act that makes marital love is the kind of act that makes new life. The only relationship that can give kids a shot at being reared by their own mother and father. The problems for the other side in this particular debate are that the Constitution doesn't tell you which of those views to adopt, and there's nothing inherently wrong with the conjugal view. And they're going to say that's not true. That last part's not right. The only way you could make your way to the conjugal view is if you were motivated by animus. I think this is one of the easiest parts of the argument to solve, and I'd be interested to see if they have a response to it. History disproves this. This isn't the only way you can get to this view. In fact, there have been cultures that span the spectrum of attitudes towards homosexuality and still have the conjugal view of marriage in their law, cultures that we're perfectly aware of and celebrated longterm samesex relationships  in ancient Greece in various forms, for example  but still thought it had nothing to do with marriage; cultures that were totally ignorant of our concept of gay identity. They didn't even know of the class in the way that we do today, to have animus against it. Couldn't have been motivated by animus. They might say, well, maybe the view itself isn't motivated by animus, but the idea that samesex marriage has anything to do with linking kids to their own mom and dad does. It's unreasonable. There's no link. And the problem with that view is that even some prominent samesex marriage supporters reject it or reject something very close it. So, for example, E.J. Graff says, of course, ideas have consequences. Changing our idea of marriage is going to have consequences for marriage, practice. And he says, in particular, it will be breathtakingly subversive to recognize gay marriage. It will introduce a revolt against the institution to its very heart, forever cutting the link between it and diapers. Andrew Sullivan says, of course, it's going to liberate us from not just complementarity but lots of other patriarchal or oppressive norms that restrict the personality, like sexual exclusivity, norms that were tailormade for oppositesex relationships. Masha Gessen, a samesex marriage advocate said it's a nobrainer that the institution of marriage shouldn't exist and that this is a stepping stone to its deinstitutionalization. They all agree that sexual complementarity, the idea of a man and woman coming together as mother and father to their kids and marriage law historically are all linked together. They just disagree on whether it's good or bad to delink them. So whatever you think of that view, you might reject it. But it can't be motivated by irrationality. And maybe someone will say, well okay, so the case law makes it clear that we can't have this vision of marriage. Professor Yoshino sometimes points to Turner that says, look, you don't lose your marriage rights when you enter a prison because after all you can have things like emotional commitment. And Professor Yoshino will say, well, there we go. That's the revision, the consentbased view being enshrined in our case law. But just two lines down it talks about the expectation of ex  of consummation. It talks about the legitimation of children born into the union. It's clearly taking for granted the conjugal view that had always been the law and just saying, apply that equally. That's the pattern for all the cases that he has brought up in his own writings. The last thing might be this: Well, it just imposes a separate status, a disadvantage and so a stigma that's Justice Kennedy's words about DOMA. Maybe that's the problem, just excluding samesex relationships is all. That's directly a violation of equality. You don't have to go to all this stuff about picking views and which one's based on what reasons. And the only problem with that view is that if it works against this vision of marriage, it works against all of them. Every marriage law creates a separate status. The whole question is where to draw the lines and do we have a reason for drawing them where we do? Does it make sense? Does it serve any public interest? Nothing our opponents tonight will say  can say will undermine the idea that there may be  that it's reasonable at least  whether you agree with it or not, to think that it's worth preferring biological parenting wherever possible, giving kids their best shot at it by using our marriage law unobtrusively to do that and leaving other adults to live and love the lives of their choice."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you, John. My friend, Professor Yoshino will address the arguments put forward by the opposition in support of continuing discrimination in marriage. In my time, I will focus on the Constitution's command of equality and the importance of the freedom to marry to samesex couples, and thus why you should vote against the motion. I think it's important to begin by noting, we're not talking here about samesex marriage, some other new thing. What we're talking about is the freedom to marry. The freedom to marry is the fundamental right affirmed by the Supreme Court at least 14 times. In the United States, rights belong to individuals, not categories. A super majority of Americans now support the freedom to marry for gay couples. Several polls showing over 60 percent with majority support in every region of the country and across virtually every demographic. Now, even if there were not majority support, the courts should uphold the Constitution. But the shift in public opinion tells us something. It tells us about the growing understanding as to how and why the Constitution does apply to gay people's lives and dreams and to our claim under the Constitution. As Americans have gotten to understand the real consequences of exclusion from that right of marriage, and as Americans have gotten to see real families not just theoretical categories and stereotypes and prejudices. They've come to understand how the Constitution's command applies equally to loving and committed couples of the samesex. The courts, too, like the American people, have shed what Justice Blackman in his dissent in the infamous 1986 case, Bowers v. Hardwick called willful blindness. And in the past two years, 65 courts  state and federal, appellate and trial level, Republican appointees and Democratic appointees,  have ruled now in favor of freedom to marry with only the smallest handful coming out the other way, one of which is now on appeal to the United States Supreme Court. And in all those 65 cases, my favorite passage comes from the case in which we brought the freedom to marry to Utah. The judge in that case says, It is not the Constitution that has changed, but the knowledge of what it means to be gay or lesbian. Only those who are willfully blind to the common humanity of gay people today can deny what is clear under the Constitution. The Supreme Court, for example, has long recognized, The freedom to marry is one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. Loving v. Virginia. The court, in another marriage case went on to say, The right to marry is of fundamental importance for all individuals. Gay people share the same mix of reasons for wanting and needing the freedom to marry and for wanting and needing respect for their lawful marriages as nongay Americans do. And the Supreme Court has spelled out what these attributes, what these aspects, what these interests in marriage are. My opponent just referred to the case, the case of Turner v. Safley, the case asking the question whether prisoners could be arbitrarily denied the freedom to marry. And in that case, the Supreme Court enumerated four important attributes of marriage. Marriage, the court said, under our constitution, in our time, not ancient Egypt, Rome, and Greece, under our Constitution and our time, the important attributes of marriage, the court said, are: number one, the opportunity to make a commitment to another person and to make a statement publicly about that commitment and have that commitment reinforced and ratified by the community in the law; number two, the spiritual and religious and personal meanings that marriage brings to many; number three, the prospect, the court said, of what the court called physical consummation, which we usually call something else, particularly on a Saturday night; and, number four, the tangible and intangible protections and responsibilities that marriage brings under our system of law. Gay people share an equal and vital interest in every single one of these important attributes. The freedom to marry is important. And, therefore, to be denied it is to not be treated equally, which, under the command of our Constitution, is a guarantee each and every American has. Under the Equal Protection Clause a classification, particularly one that disadvantages a historically disfavored group of Americans, or a classification that implicates fundamental liberties, fundamental freedoms, or individual dignity, under the Equal Protection Clause, the government must have a sufficient and legitimate reason for drawing that line because the Constitution guarantees that all Americans subjected to a classification must be treated alike. In this case, because of the importance of what is being denied and because it is being denied to a group of Americans who are historically disadvantaged, who have been oppressed, who have been discriminated against, not only in private life but by the government itself, there's all the more reason for the courts to apply what court after court have now done, a meaningful review. And under that meaningful review, there is no justification for continuing this discrimination. And you should vote, No."

    "data": "Thank you very much. I, too, am delighted to be here and to participate in this debate with such esteemed colleagues. In the brief that Evan Wolfson filed in the Supreme Court in the marriage case that's currently being heard there, he repeated over and over again, The real definition of equal protection is  comes to us from Supreme Court precedent. It's not a requirement that everybody be treated equally no matter what the circumstances, it's that all persons who are similarly situated shall be treated alike. And he repeats this over and over again. On page seven on the brief the operative presumption is that the legislature has presumably permissively determined that the persons affected by a classification are not similarly situated in the first place. The real question for us is whether the Equal Protection Clause require us to understand or to adopt one version of marriage by which everybody agrees people are similarly situated. If the institution of marriage is simply about the loving relationships between adults and the dignity that the state might confer on that relationship, then there's no reason to distinguish one set of relationships from another. But if marriage is about something different than that, if it's about that unique biological complementarity of men and women structured in a institution that gives life to the offspring of that relationship, then it's quite obvious that samesex and oppositesex couples are not similarly situated. And it doesn't violate Equal Protection not to treat groups who are not similarly situated differently. That's the real question for us, what is the very purpose of marriage therefore? Is it for the state to confer a dignity, to recognize this adult relationship, as Evan has claimed? Or is it something else, something much more profound? Why is it that every society in human history, across cultures and ages, have adopted something very similar to the man/woman understanding of marriage that we're talking about today? It's because there's something inherent in the nature of men and women, and that function that they alone can provide that is essential to the marital relationship and to the creation of the next generation. When the Supreme Court 14 times in its cases has talked about marriage as a fundamental right, it has always been in the context of that basic understanding. In Loving v. Virginia, it went on in the sentence after the one Evan quoted to say because it's necessary  it's essential to our very existence and survival. That's not true if you remove from that purpose of the institution this unique procreative ability of men and women. So, what is the purpose of marriage? What is the state's interest or reason for getting involved in the institution of marriage at all? There are all sorts of relationships that the state doesn't have anything to say about: friendships, brothersister relationships, motherfather, cousins, all sorts of relationships. The state has no interest in getting it  even if they're very loving relationships, even if they're romantically loving relationships. That's not why the state got in the marriage business in the first place, and why it is the third party in every marriage contract. It's this unique procreative ability of men and women. And the third is, if we're going to radically redefine that purpose to be about adults rather than that childcentered focus, who decides that question? Well, in our society, in almost every case, the Constitution does not settle those questions. It leaves it up to the people to decide. And that's the real question we have here. Has this constitutional provision adopted in 1868 already decided this question for us, and said, You know, you people, you don't get to decide this question. We're not talking about discriminating against a group of people. That the Constitution has decided. We're talking about redefining a core societal institution to be a dramatically different purpose than it has ever had before. That question the Constitution doesn't decide. And it's that question that we have to answer on the getgo. So, we've got a lot of history here to try and figure out what exactly this purpose of marriage is. You go all the way back to California cases  I'm from California, so I'll start with some there  100 years ago, we had this clear. The first purpose of matrimony, by the laws of nature and society, is procreation. And then 100 years later it shows it hasn't changed. The sexual procreative and childrearing aspects of marriage go to the very essence of the marital relation. Justice Kennedy, in his opening of his opinion in the Windsor case, striking down the Defense of Marriage Act just two years ago, he says this at the very beginning: For marriage between a man and a woman, no doubt it's been thought of by most people as essential to the very definition of that term. And to its role and function throughout the history of civilization. Those are the questions  those  that's what we understand marriage to be. And it takes a radical redefinition of it, a change in its core purpose, to create  to create an equality of claim here. And it's that change in purpose that raises a lot of concerns and raises the state interest about not changing this. So, what happens if we just change the institution of marriage? Well, we've got an experiment with this. 50 years ago, we changed another core aspect of marriage  the norm of its permanence. We did it by adopting nofault divorce laws. We said, you know, if things hit a bump in the road, you can get out of your marriage a lot easier than you could. Everybody said at the time It won't affect the institution of marriage. It won't alter your marriage. But what we've seen over those 50 years is a dramatic reduction in the societal norms the  the incentive that the institutional understanding, the definitional understanding provided. People no longer  in many instances  think that marriage is a lifelong commitment. It's a lifelong commitment unless I hit bumps on the road, ceases to be in the way of my adult fulfillment, and then I get out of it. That little shift changed it from a child centered institution to an adultcentered institution. And it has had dramatic consequences. Well, we're now talking about a shift that's even more profound, to remove the gender complementarity, the gender diversity in the raising of children  all of those things  to make this more about the adult relationship than the child who are the offspring of that manwoman union  is going to dramatically reduce the incentives that that institution provides as a cultural norms  cultural."

    "data": "So I, too, am so honored to be here with esteemed colleagues to debate this crucial issue. And I want to begin with the language of the Equal Protection Clause, which says, No state shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. When this language was ratified in 1868, we were coming off of a civil war. And the framers of that amendment could easily have limited the equality in question to the context of race. In fact, if we look at the adjacent, roughly contemporaneous 13th and 15th Amendments, the three together known as the Reconstruction Amendments, we see that there are limitations to race, to color, to the previous condition of servitude. So why is it that the framers did not cabin the notion of equality to race, but instead adverted to a higher level of generality and said, this means equality for all individuals. I would offer to you that they jumped up to that level of abstraction because they wanted to leave it to intelligence of successive generations to determine what equality meant for them. Indeed, if the Equal Protection Clause had not been framed in these majestic and soaring abstract terms, gender equality would not have been able to be a heightened scrutiny classification, by which I mean a classification that draws the particular solicitude of the court, moving us from the presumption that a law is constitutional to moving us to the presumption that it's unconstitutional when heightened scrutiny is applied. Gender discrimination would not be a protected classification under the Equal Protection Clause if we adhere to the understanding of equality that obtained in 1868. So the question for my opponents is, do they believe that the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause, even though it was textually framed at that level of generality, does not protect women as a heightened scrutiny classification. And if it protects women, then why would it not protect sexual orientation? I would also offer to you that we can think about this, as Mr. Rosenkranz said at the beginning of this debate, either as a sex discrimination issue or as a sexual orientation discrimination issue. If we think about it as a sex discrimination issue, they will already make bars on samesex marriage presumptively unconstitutional. If we think about it as a sexual orientation discrimination issue, this is a harder lift, because the Supreme Court has not yet taught us or told us whether or not heightened scrutiny will be applied in a formal way to the classifications based on sexual orientation. So I want to make the steepest climb. I want to both assume that the most deferential level of review will be applied by the court under the Equal Protection Clause. And I want to assume the definition of marriage that was forwarded by my opponents and to say that the Equal Protection Clause requires, right, gays to be included within the institution of marriage even if we understand that marriage has at least a procreative dimension. The first thing I want to point out here, going to Professor Eastman's comments about the propagation of the species, is that gay individuals are not infertile. Gay individuals procreate. And in fact, my husband and I have two children, and those two children are among the hundreds of thousands of children in this country alone who are being raised by samesex couples. So the argument has to be that we're doing a worse job at raising them  and this would be Mr. Girgis' point  than heterosexual couples are doing with their children. And I would only say that this is not a theoretical question. It's an empirical question. And every major professional organization that touches the interests of children  including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the National Association of Social Workers  all of these professional organizations have said that gay parents are doing just as well as straight parents in raising their children. The kids are all right. With regard to the second rationale that might be offered, is the notion that Professor Eastman alluded to which is the deinstitutionalization of heterosexual marriage. And the idea here is that if gay people are permitted to get married, then heterosexual couples will lose esteem for the institution and engage in procreative activity outside of the institution. Now, this is counterintuitive at best, you know, as was articulated by one of the witnesses in the Prop 8 trial. I don't think many of you heterosexual people are going to go home and say, you know, we've had a good run, but now that Ted and Steve down the street can get married, we have to throw in the towel, and we're not going to get married anymore. So I think more needs to be said empirically about the deinstitutionalization argument. I want to close with the words of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in a canonical 1996 Equal Protection case, because we are talking about equality. She said the history of our Constitution is a story in which constitutional rights and protections were extended to groups that were previously ignored or excluded. To include those groups, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to oppose this motion. Thank you."

    "data": "All right. Thanks very much, everybody. Thanks for coming. I’m really pleased to be here and honored to be joined on my side of the debate by Tom Pickering. Also glad to be up here with Mark and Mike. They play an important role. We disagree on this subject, but they play an important role in what is a really important debate. Let me get straight to the point. Tom and I are going to argue that the Iran deal of President Obama is good for America for three basic reasons. One, it’s important for the United States to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Two, this deal effectively does that, and it does it while avoiding a costly and unpredictable conflict. And three, the alternatives to this deal  the alternatives to this deal are far worse. And I’m going to ask you to pay particular attention to this third point, because I suspect our opponents in this debate will spend a considerable amount of time telling you why this agreement is imperfect and why it should also have X, Y, and Z. What I don’t think you’ll hear them do is present a credible and realistic alternative to it. And I remind you as we start, that the proposition on the table is not, Is this a perfect deal that you would write alone if you didn’t have to negotiate it with somebody else? but Is it good for America? And I think if that’s the question, it clearly is. In fact, I don’t even think it’s much of a close call. The first point, I’ll be very brief on. The United States has an interest in stopping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon because an Iran with a nuclear weapon could threaten the region and some of our close allies, including Israel. It could be a precedent and a stimulant for other countries in the region to develop nuclear weapons. And it would be harder to deter and contain it in terms of its foreign policy in the region. I just want that to be clear. I don’t think our opponents disagree with that, so I would just want to stipulate it upfront. That doesn’t require a debate. It is important for the United States. What we disagree on is whether this deal effectively does that. And Tom and I will assert that it does, and let me tell you why and why it’s good for America. The framework agreement that the Obama Administration negotiated cuts of all of the possible paths for Iran to get a nuclear weapon. Now, in this brief opening statement, this is not the place for a very detailed analysis of every provision in the agreement. I suspect most of you have already read it and are familiar with it. What I would do is underscore some of what this agreement does. And I would ask you to think about it in these terms: Imagine the world before us with the agreement, if we get it finalized and we implement it, and imagine the world without the agreement. Think about those two alternatives  alternative worlds for the future and ask yourself which one you want to live in, which one is good for America. I said the deal cuts off all of the possible paths to an Iranian nuclear weapon. There are three basic paths: Enriching uranium to be able to use it for a bomb, using plutonium to create a nuclear weapon, or a covert path. And this agreement stops all of those tracks. On enrichment, what does the agreement do? With the agreement, Iran would have to take its current stockpile of low enriched uranium, which is around 10,000 kilograms or 12 tons, enough for several nuclear weapons today, as we discussed this, and get rid of 98 percent of it, keep only 300 kilograms. Without it, they could have whatever stockpile they like. With this agreement, they would have to get rid of twothirds of their installed centrifuges. Today they have 20,000 installed centrifuges. With this agreement, it would have to go down to 6,000, of which only 5,000 could be operating for 10 years. And they would all have to be the oldest technology, the least efficient. Without it, they can operate whatever centrifuges they like. With the agreement, they would have to stop all of their enrichment at an underground facility called Fordow and they could only keep nonoperating centrifuges there. Without the agreement, they can use Fordow for whatever they like. With the agreement, Iran couldn’t use its more advanced centrifuges to do enrichment for 10 years and would have longterm limits on research and development. Without the agreement, they can do whatever R&D they want and develop more advanced centrifuges very quickly. With this agreement, Iran could not enrich uranium to 20 percent, the level, if you recall, when the Israeli prime minister was here in New York a couple of years ago, he identified as the most concerning thing. So if you enrich uranium to 20 percent, it’s a short step away from 90 percent and the ability to use it for a bomb. The interim agreement that we negotiated got rid of that 20 percent stockpile, this agreement requires Iran to not enrich at all to 20 percent, closes off all the potential paths to highly enriched uranium for a bomb. It also closes off the plutonium path. With the agreement, Iran has to get rid of its current heavy water reactor at a place called Arak and replace it with one that would not produce any weaponsgrade plutonium at all. And it couldn’t do any reprocessing. It has to ship the core out and can’t use this site. Without the agreement, they can finish production of that heavy water reactor and start producing weaponsgrade plutonium. Finally, and maybe most importantly, this blocks the covert path. With this agreement in place, Iran would be bound to accept unprecedented intrusive inspections, forever, with a mechanism for resolving disputes. We would have access to their entire fuel cycle from the mines and mills of uranium to production sites for centrifuges all the way to the enrichment sites themselves where there would be cameras and inspectors on a regular basis. That’s what we have if we get this agreement, if we conclude this agreement. Without this agreement, we don’t have any of that, and we have no idea what Iran is up to. The bottom line of all that, when you put it all together, is Iran’s breakout timeline, the amount of time it would take them to get enough material for a bomb, goes from around two months, what it is today, to over a year, which our military specialists are confident give us enough time to react if they seek to violate it. I could go on, but you get the bottom line point. When you compare these two worlds that we could live in with the agreement or without the agreement, clearly, this agreement is good for the United States. Indeed, I think it’s not even a close call. When Tom takes the floor  I’ve made the positive case for this agreement. When Tom takes the floor, he’ll be able to talk about some of the reasons why not only is this a good agreement, but all of the potential alternatives to it are much, much worse. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you. It’s fantastic to be here. There’s nothing more wonderful than Central Park in the springtime except the IQ2 debate. Now, as you know, we’re going to argue  Mark and I are going to argue against. We think this is a very bad deal. Let me just get right to the point. To me, this is like  say you’re a legitimate businessman, and a Mafioso comes and you’re in a little bit of  you’re in a little bit of trouble financially, and he offers you a loan, and you take it, and you tell yourself that this is a temporary thing and that as the Mafioso becomes your partner, over time, he’s going to moderate, he’s going to understand what it’s like to get honest profits, and he’s going to change, and he’s going to start abiding by the law. This agreement would be fantastic if we were making this agreement with Denmark, but we’re not. We’re making it with Iran. We know Iran well. We’ve known them for 35 years. We know what they’re like. The Iran that we have today is the Iran that we had 10 years ago. It’s the Iran that we had 20 years ago. It’s the Iran that we had 35 years ago. And that’s  that is actually the single most important question that I want to put to you tonight is, why do we think that this regime is going to abide by this agreement? That’s the  that is the single most important  the single most important question, and the administration never, ever  never ever talks about it. Now, there are two stories out there that are being told. One is the story that the Obama administration is telling, and the other story is the one that our allies in the Middle East are telling. The story the Obama administration is telling us goes something like this: Back in  back in April of 2013, there was an election in Iran which brought to power this guy Rouhani, who is a reformer. And Rouhani wanted to change relations with the West. He wanted to change all of this enmity and conflict between Iran and the West. And so he started this negotiation with the Americans, and he made some very important concessions to the Americans, concessions that they had never made, along the lines of the ones that Phil was talking about, basically the essence was a willingness to constrain their nuclear  their nuclear program. And that then has led to this process that we have here before us today. That’s not the story that our allies are telling. They’re saying that this process is not the result of a strategic change in Iran. It’s the result of a strategic change in Washington. The United States  the United States started this process with major concessions. It ripped up six Security Council resolutions that called for zero reprocessing and zero enrichment. It gave Iran, in the first step, as part of the interim agreement, it gave it the right to enrich, and it said also that the restrictions on its program would be temporary, right? So the negotiation after that  after the initial interim agreement and the negotiations were over how long would that period of temporary restriction be? And under what  how big would the restrictions on the  on the program be? And what would Iran get in return? Now, just for signing up to the interim agreement, we started paying Iran $700 million a month. We’re paying them to negotiate with us. We’re going to  when they sign the deal, we’re going to give them $50 billion right up front and shortly thereafter and additional $70 to $90 billion. Now, when you ask John Kerry, what’s the evidence that there’s been a strategic change on the part of the Iranian regime? He says, Well, look, they signed the interim agreement, and they have negotiated for over a year now with us, and they have abided by the terms of the interim agreement during this period of negotiation. We paid them to do that. We paid them to do that, and we have dangled out a big prize at the end of this signing bonus and the relief from  and the relief from all sanctions. So, of course, they’re going to be  they’re going to play nice at the negotiating table. What other evidence do we have other than the fact that they have allowed us to pay them to negotiate with us, that they have made a strategic shift? No evidence whatsoever. They still are the  they still spout the same antiSemitic rhetoric, they still call for the destruction of Israel, they still destabilize their neighbors. They still have four Americans who are hostage there. They have a Marine, they have a cleric, they have a newspaper reporter, and they have a former FBI agent. They didn’t even have the  they didn’t have  they didn’t even have the grace and the good manners to release the hostages during this  during this negotiation. Now, Mark and I are going to divide our duties here. Mark is going to explain to you why all of those characteristics of the deal that Phil went through are basically a fiction, why it’s a fantasy to think that any of this  that the Iranians will abide by any of these  by any of these terms that Phil mentioned. I am just going to make a couple of statements about the broader problem of the deal in the region. Mark’s going to talk about the nuclear breakout. I’m going to talk about the regional breakout. We are turning  with this deal, we are turning Iran into the regional hegemon in the Middle East, all right? We have turned a blind eye to the expansion of Iranian power in Iraq, in Syria, in Yemen, and elsewhere across the region. And when we hand them $50 billion a few months from now, if, in fact, we do, we’re going to see an expansion of those  an expansion of those activities. That’s one problem. Another problem is we have set off with this deal a regional nuclear arms race. The Saudis have said openly, explicitly, that they are going to match the Iranians capability for capability. They’re not going to wait for this deal to end before they start developing their own capability, and they have made that explicit. There’s no way to deny, absolutely no way to deny, that there is not a regional nuclear arms race underway right now. The other thing is this deal does not make the United States any safer. One of the things that has been left off the table, not part of the negotiations, is the illegal ballistic missiles program of the Iranians. So before long we’re going to have an Iran  a nuclear Iran with a ballistic missile capability capable of hitting the United States. A good deal, a good deal  and this is what we need to define  a good deal is one that stops Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, A; B, makes our allies in the region feel safer and stabilizes the region; and, three, makes the United States safer. This deal does not meet that basic criteria. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you, John, and thank you for your warm welcome. It’s a pleasure to be here with Phil and also with Mike and Mark. I have much I think to say tonight in a very short period of time, and I will do what I can to compress it. Not too long ago when he was still alive, Daniel Patrick Moynihan said famously that, You’re each entitled to your own opinion but not your own set of facts. Tonight from Mr. Doran we’ve heard an extremely interesting, unusual, and strange set of facts. So let me just cover a few of those that I think will be helpful to your understanding of the arrangements that we have to deal with. First and foremost is the notion in his part that somehow $50 billion will pass on the moment of signature. The truth is, of course, that until Iran complies with four major requirements of the deal  that they put their centrifuges aside; that they change their stockpile from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms; that they, in fact, dismantle the central piece of the reactor that can make plutonium; and that they agree on that the past efforts that they made in a nuclear direction, in a nuclear weapons direction, are fully explained to and satisfactorily explained to the International Atomic Energy Agency  they get nothing out of this deal. No sanctions relief until those particular steps take place, no money passes hands to Iran. Secondly, the notion that Iran is somehow going to enjoy, when it does get this money, the opportunity to play havoc in the Middle East is both strange and unusual. Certainly we watch carefully what Iran does. And none of us have undertaken the notion that the Iranians are angels, that the whole agreement is indeed put together with very strong inspection mechanisms well beyond what you have ever seen before in any country around the world in order to prevent the kind of cheating or indeed the kind of misuse of the agreement for narrow political advantage. Were the Iranians, in fact, going to misuse this money, they would have far done it well before any receipts from sanctions relief, their priorities for the things that they’re doing in the region are high enough, I think, for them to continue to do that. It is important, too, to remember this is a nuclear agreement, not a ballistic missile agreement. Both sides have agreed on the importance of the nuclear agreement as a matter of priority. Obviously, a missile  ballistic missile without a nuclear warhead is not the kind of threat that has been portrayed to you here. And there are plenty of opportunities in the next set of agreements, if this one is successfully concluded, to move on to that particular effort. Now, let me turn, if I can, to the key questions, and they’re important to all of us here. You’ve already understood that both sides share a deep sense of the necessity to stop any Iranian nuclear weapon. That’s stipulated and agreed. It’s important, however, to understand that the second question  is this a good deal for America  is one that we would certainly answer in the positive for a whole set of reasons that Phil set out for you. And the third question is, what are the alternatives to this deal? Well, the alternatives, quite starkly and quite frankly, are two: no deal at all, or an attempt to use sanctions to see if, in fact, we can achieve a better deal. You heard from Mr. Doran that he would like to have zero enrichment. I would like to have zero enrichment, too. I’d like to be a billionaire. I’d like to believe in the Tooth Fairy. But for 14 years, previous administrations attempted to negotiate for zero enrichment, and got nowhere. And the value of zero enrichment, in my view, is not significant compared to the value of the arrangement that we now have on the table, with all of its inspection mechanisms, and with all of its limitations on Iran, and that’s extremely important to keep in mind. In addition to that, what would happen if we walked away from an agreement? How and in what way would that affect the situation? It would affect it very badly. We would have turned down what our allies joined us in negotiating. The notion that we could achieve effective additional sanctions without friends, allies, and indeed, without the participation of the world community, is well beyond reality. It’s not there and it’s not [unintelligible]. The third question is, what would happen in the event we had no agreement. Iran, of course, could move freely to a nuclear weapon. They would have two to three months to breakout time. They would, if they  they’re so inclined, use that opportunity, as we have a 10year agreement with a 15year limitation on the production of more than 300 kilograms of lowenriched uranium to hold them in place, and I think that’s important. Finally, I think it’s significant that you understand that the alternatives to an agreement may well involve the necessity to use force under conditions where we would be highly isolated, having turned down the kind of agreement we participated centrally in negotiating  a good agreement. If we were to use force, it would mean, I think, from the best judgment that I can get of military officials, a three to fiveyear cessation in the Iranian agreement before they could move back to where they are now. And a situation under which we would have to bomb pretty continuously to keep the Iranians under that kind of stricture and under that kind of pressure. To me, there is no alternative. This agreement is a good one. I hope that you will consider that carefully. And when the time comes to push your little button, push the button in the right order for the right set of arrangements that President Obama has put before you. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you. Great. Well, thank you very much, John, Phil, Tom, Mike. It’s really a pleasure for this Canadian, wanttobeAmerican, to be in such distinguished company. I’m very humbled to be here. I’m going to discuss the emerging deal’s seven deadly flaws. I support a good deal, but this is not a good deal. I’m also going to suggest to you that this deal will make war more likely, not less likely. And I’m going to actually take Phil up on his challenge, and I’m going to sketch out what a better deal looks like. The seven deadly flaws: First of all, President Obama and his administration only about 18 months ago committed to, quote, unquote, Dismantle substantial portions or a lot of Iran’s nuclear program. This deal will leave Iran’s nuclear infrastructure virtually intact. And Iran will be a turn of the screw away from developing a nuclear weapon, only a year’s breakout from that weapon. And that year breakout will only last for 10 years. Thereafter, the breakout time will diminish significantly, and by year 15, Iran will have zero breakout, that’s undetectable breakout. Number two, the administration gave up on longstanding U.S. policy and multiple UN Security Council resolutions, and they gave Iran domestic enrichment which is the key element it needs to develop a nuclear weapon. Now, that was fine, except this most valuable concession wasn’t given up at the end of the negotiation in exchange for other valuable concessions. No, this was given at the beginning of the negotiation, before Iran had really done anything significant. And now we’re in a situation where Iran is going to have significant enrichment capacity. The administration started off by offering 500 centrifuges. Now Iran’s going to have 6,000 centrifuges. That’s a 1,200 percent increase in the course of these negotiations. Well, here’s a fun fact for you: 6,000 centrifuges, woefully inadequate if you want peaceful nuclear energy. But it’s exactly what you need if you want to weaponize uranium. Number three, we’ve heard about missiles quite extensively from the folks over here. Let me just talk about an ICBM, an  intercontinental ballistic missile is not for putting monkeys into space. It is for delivering a warhead to New York City. And the Iranians said that this was nonnegotiable. The administration said, Fine. We’ll take it off the table. Number four, the Fordow enrichment facility. This is an enrichment facility that is buried under a mountain on a Revolutionary Guard military base. The administration promised to dismantle it, then to shutter it. And now it’s going to be left open for 15 years to develop medical isotopes. It’ll be the most heavily fortified, heavily guarded medical isotope facility in the Milky Way. And the problem is, in 15 years’ time, the Iranians can reconvert it to do advanced centrifuge powered enrichment in a heavily guarded, underground bunker underneath a mountain. Number five, and this is the serious issue with this deal. It’s the poison pill. Many of the restrictions on this deal are going to start sunsetting, in other words, disappearing, after year 10. And by year 15, most of these restrictions are going to go away. Iran is going to have an industrial sized military program, with unlimited centrifuge capacity, zero breakout, multiple heavy water reactors, and the ability to actually develop a program that is widely dispersed and very, very difficult to verify. This deal would have converted this Iranian regime, this regime, from a nuclear pariah into a nuclear partner. Let me talk about verification and inspection because I believe our opponents are going to bet their debate and bet the security of the United States of America on verification and inspection. This is the idea that we will have unprecedented inspections. Well, the problem with unprecedented inspections is that Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader, just last week said, You are not getting into my military bases, into my Revolutionary Guard bases. [unintelligible] Revolutionary Guard commander said anybody who tries is going to be met with hot lead. I looked up hot lead in the dictionary. It means a bullet. Now, that’s a serious problem because this is a bet on verification and detection. And let’s talk about the U.S. track record in detecting and stopping countries from going nuclear. We missed the Soviet Union, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea. We underestimated Saddam’s program in 1990. Then we overestimated his program in 2003 and went to war to stop a nonexistent WMD program. We have a lousy record of detecting when countries go nuclear. And this is going to be a massive program on a territory more than twice the size of Texas. That is what the IAEA will have to verify, particularly when this is an industrial sized program. Number seven, and finally, the IAEA doesn’t enforce. They verify, they monitor. The United States of America enforces. Now the only way we’re going to enforce this deal peacefully is through economic coercion, what is known as snapback sanctions. Here’s the problem with snapback sanctions. They don’t snap back very well. Iran will have a powerful economy in 10 to 15 years. They’re going to get hundreds of billions of dollars of sanctions relief. They’re going to be increasingly immunized against future economic pressure. We’re going to end up in snapback disputes with the Russians and the Chinese at the Security Council. In fact, we’re going to end up in snapback disputes with the Europeans when we try snapback sanctions against our French and British and German friends. We will hit a wall of intransigence at the Security Council, and we will hit a wall of human greed in the marketplace. And the problem is as we give up our peaceful enforcement mechanism in order to enforce the deal, this is going to make war more likely, not less likely. Iran will be able to creep out, or inch out, or sneak out, or they’ll wait patiently until many of these restrictions disappear. And if we are lucky enough to detect an Iranian sneakout or breakout, war will be our only option. And when that war comes, Iran will be much stronger, and the consequences will be much worse. Now, what about a better deal? Well, let me spell out a better deal in seven quick points. Number one, no sunset provision based on arbitrary time period. Iran should have to be certified by the IAEA as having a peaceful nuclear program without any clandestine nuclear facilities. Number two, no long range ballistic missiles capable of carrying a warhead. Number three, shut down the Fordow facility. There’s only one purpose, and that is for weaponization. Number four, go anywhere, go any time, snap inspections into any Revolutionary Guard base. Number five, Iran has been stonewalling the international community on its possible military dimensions of its program. Iran should come clean before the deal, not after a deal, and certainly before we give them hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. And number six, economic leverage. It should not be dependent on sanctions. President Obama said no deal is better than a bad deal. That is not this emerging deal. Let’s take time to negotiate a better deal. Why are we rushing towards a bad deal? My bet, compared to Obama’s deal, Hillary’s deal will be much better. In fact, compared to Obama’s deal, the leading Republican contenders will have a better deal. Hillary and the Republican contenders are the ultimate snapback. That’s why you should vote against the proposition that Obama’s deal is good for America. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. And thank you, John. We're gathered here tonight to talk about our intelligence, and about whether our smartphones, and our apps, and our social media accounts are expanding it or eroding it. Are we more thoughtful now, thanks to our technologies, or less thoughtful? And I think you can approach that question from two different angles. And a little bit later, my colleague, Andrew Keen, is going to look at it from a social and cultural angle. How is the technology influencing our collective intelligence? What I'd like to do is talk about it from a very personal, individual level. How is the technology influencing the way our minds work? And now, by now I think all of us, if we're honest, know pretty well how we use our gadgets. We use them compulsively. And the research bears this out. The average person with a smartphone will pull out the phone and look at it about 150 times a day. And that breaks down to about six minutes for your every waking hour. The average teenager or 20  early 20somethingyearold will send or receive about 4,000 text messages a month. And that also breaks down to about one every six minutes. And when you start to add up all the messages, all the notifications, all the alerts, all the Pins, all the Instagrams, all the Google searches, and everything else, what you get is a clear picture that we have created, with this powerful digital technology, a new environment for ourselves. An environment of constant distraction  almost perpetual interruption. Now, that suits the purposes, suits the interests of companies like Google and Facebook, because they make more money the more we gobble up little bits of information. But what does it actually do to our brains and how our brains operate? To answer that question, I think we have to look at how we transform information, which is just the raw material of thinking, into actual knowledge. And that process hinges on the transfer of that information between two forms of memory. On the one hand, you have your working memory, which is essentially the contents of your consciousness at any given moment. What you're thinking about right now is your working memory. And we know  what we know about working memory is it has an extremely small capacity. You can only hold about two to four pieces of information in your mind, your conscious mind, simultaneously. And then on the other side, you have our longterm memory, what we usually refer to as memory. The store of all the facts you know, the experiences you've had, the people you recognize. And this  if working memory is very small capacity, longterm memory has a huge capacity. You can never actually fill it up. You can never get to the point where you say, I can't remember anything anymore. The key to building knowledge, the key to deep intelligence is being able to move incoming information from your conscious mind over into your longterm memory. This is a process called memory consolidation, and it's through this consolidation that you create connections and associations between what you're experiencing now, what you're learning now, and what you already know. And it's those connections and associations between the information and the experiences in your mind that form the basis for true knowledge. That is the foundation for conceptual thinking, critical thinking, creative thinking. The problem, today, is that we're constantly overloading that small store of our working memory. And this creates a phenomenon  an actual biological phenomenon called cognitive overload. If you think about it, if you can only hold two to four pieces of information in your conscious mind, then if you're constantly taking in new information, you have to push the existing information out very, very quickly in order to make room. And what we know is that consolidation, this kind of weaving together of information into knowledge, requires attentiveness. It's only when you attend to something in your working memory that you actually transfer it to your working memory and make it part of your knowledge. What we've created, in other words, is an environment that is constantly frustrating our mind's ability to create deep knowledge and to think deeply. Now, we are right to celebrate all the great things we get from smart technologies, from the internet. It's great to celebrate the fact that we have access to all this information and all this conversation immediately. But what we too often forget is that information is not knowledge, it's not intelligence, and it's certainly not wisdom. And when we spend all of our time gathering information, what gets crowded out is the time to distance yourself from distractions and interruptions and think deeply about things, think deeply about the experiences you're having, think deeply about the new facts you're learning, think deeply about the conversation you're having. This is the kind of thinking that the internet and smart devices in general, by peppering us with messages and little bits of information all day long, is stealing from us. We're losing that contemplative, deep, focused, attentive state of mind that is crucial to the creation of knowledge, the creation of intelligence, and deep thinking in general. So even though we can celebrate all the great things the internet does, I think we have to be honest with ourselves. And I would suggest you look not only to the science and not only to what everybody on the stage is going to say, but to your own experience with the technology, how you use it, whether, when you want to think deeply, you pull out your smartphone, or you try to distance yourself from your smartphone and from your computers. And by thinking about your own experience, I think you'll get a clue to the broader theme of what this technology is doing to us. And I think, if you're honest with yourself, you'll conclude that indeed our smart technologies are making us dumb, and you'll vote for that proposition. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you, Nick and  so if Nick is right, and our technology is having this physical effect on our physical brain, keeping us from being able to form knowledge out of information, then why is this  it seems to me to that this is  this is the greatest time in human history to be somebody who cares about knowledge. This is  this is a renaissance of knowledge. If we take the question, Is our smart tech making us dumb, I want to not even refute that. I want to ask, why do we keep asking that? Because if smart means that we make good decisions, then we are  new predictive technologies, very smart  enable us to do that. If being smart means understanding more, we now have from the Higgs boson to the Hubble telescope, we have the ability through our smart technology to understand more about a universe that's 14 billion years old. And if smart means better at our work, then I absolutely, and you absolutely, want your doctor, your auto mechanic, and your airplane pilot to have the smartest technology that there is. So why do we have ask? I think in part it's because of the shock of the new. And this is very, very new, what's going on. Andy Clark is a philosopher who makes a point that we don't know, we don't think in our heads. We think with things in the world, out in the world. So a mathematician thinks with chalk on a blackboard. An architect thinks with models in her hands or using a straight edge or something. And a meteorologist who is using our old tech, who just has a weather vane is not going to be nearly as smart as a meteorologist who's gather data from sensors around the world, big data put to use to predict the weather down to the hour. That's really, really smart. And it's our smart technology that lets us do that. If Clark is right, and I think he is, that we think of objects out in the world, and if those tools change, and if they change radically, then the way that we think changes radically, which is why I think we even consider the possibility that our smart tech is making us dumb when all the evidence seems to be that in fact we are smarter in the important ways than ever. Another reason perhaps we entertain this notion is that we have a natural tendency to think that the technology we grew up with is natural and is good. But that's not the case. We didn't invent gatekeepers because we said  in the old world, in a prior world  we didn't invent gatekeepers because we thought it was just a swell idea to vastly limit the amount of information and knowledge that we were going to make public, and we didn't say, You know what would be really swell? Let's create a set of homogenous white guys, and they'll decide what makes it through those gates. We invented gatekeepers because the old medium, that technology of paper, was so limited. It had gates, and the gates were really, really narrow. And so we needed to have gatekeepers. But now we don't. Now the gates are down. We have this huge abundance, and we adopt new strategies for that. And sometimes it's disconcerting. One of the main strategies is that we skim. We skim a lot. That's actually a really adaptive technology  technique for dealing with it. And it's not even an old technique. It's a technique that we use when we go into an oldfashioned real bookstore and there are thousands of titles, and we skim them on the shelves really quickly to find what we're interested  and that  so we still do that now. We're doing it online. And just as then, when we find something that's interesting to us, we are able to drill down into it. We start reading it. It's  in this age of constant distraction, we can't focus, we're watching seven years of Game of Thrones, the most complex narrative that we've ever seen in our world. And I'll see you Sunday night. It's great. We love this stuff. Our children are reading seven volumes of complex, intricate narrative and characterization. Our universities are turning out experts and scholars who are deep into their topics, deeper than ever because they can go that deep because of the internet. So I don't think the evidence is there, despite the brain chemistry, that we are in fact not knowing. We are knowing more and better than ever. If you think back to the 1980s, for example, you get a newspaper, you'd read the article, you'd find something, you'd read an article. It was really exciting, you wanted to know more. You want  but you can't because it's 1980. And all you've got was that rectangle of print. That's what it was like before we had smart technology. You were just stuck. It's infuriating even to think about at this point. That's not right. It's certainly not natural. So let me give you an example: 1911, with the  sorry, Britannica, Encyclopedia Britannica had its first article on Oliver Goldsmith, the playwright, 6,000 words long. Each new edition, that gets shorter because they've got to cram in more stuff. By 1994, it's down to 1,500 words which means that it's  the editors of the Britannica, the gatekeepers of knowledge and culture, have thrown out 75 percent of what Britannica knows about Goldsmith, because that's how paper works. Wikipedia article, it's 1,400 words, but you've got to count all of the  look into all of the links, decide which ones of those count in the total for Goldsmith. You can do the apples to apples. It's  and there will be much more. And people will disagree about what  which of those links count, which is fine, because in Wikipedia and on the web overall, knowledge is no longer crammed into rectangles. They assume a much more natural shape, which is that of a web, which is  has near infinite capacity. It enables us to accommodate much more complexity of relationships, indefinite complexity, is much bigger than any one brain could ever have made. And we get to see how the knowledge is made, which is in many ways very disconcerting. We see that it's human. It's a human product. It's full of fallibility, we see the people are arguing, they're adding, they're getting things wrong, they're getting things right. That's how knowledge is made. That's how knowledge was always made. But now we can see it. It's in our face. And that's a truth. That's a truth about knowledge that was always true of knowledge. But now that we can see it, we're beginning  it's an amazing thing. We're beginning to invent and discover together new ways of building knowledge, of talking together and building knowledge. This has  we've never been in a period like this before. But it may  it's upsetting because now we have to face the truth that knowledge has always, always been a human product and always, therefore, subject to and characterized by the fallibility of humans. So it seems clear to me that to argue that our smart tech is making us dumb is not only to be on the wrong side of history; in this case, it's to be on the wrong side of evolution. So I urge you to vote against the proposition and to do so emphatically."

    "data": "Well, I've often been accused of being on the wrong side of history, but I love the idea of being on the wrong side of evolution. If my mother was alive, she would particularly appreciate that. That's why I'm not married either. So David is clearly a passionate man, I have a great deal of respect and love for him. We've jousted many times before, but I've never heard him quite as effusive of our world. He talks about something he calls a renaissance of knowledge. A renaissance of knowledge, David, when was the last time you turned the Internet on? When was the list time you looked at Twitter? When was the last time you went on Facebook? When was the last time you observed the nature of our digital culture, the very culture that Nick so brilliantly tore apart in his opening remarks? You argue that  and Nick brings up this word, distance  we're talking, of course, in this new media, the media that you describe as a renaissance of knowledge  what Nick is describing is the end of distance. Perhaps if we were academics, we would call it, the death of distance, the end of distance. So we have these devices. I know this is radio, but on the radio you can imagine what I'm waving. We have the death of distance. We have a culture of intimacy, of personalization. This is the culture of intimacy and personalization that has replaced what you described as narrow gatekeepers. We all become the media in this world. We all have our devices. We all have our publishing platforms. We can all tell the world what we're thinking, what we're doing, where we're going, what we're wearing, unfortunately sometimes what we're not wearing. We all have these technologies  Wiki, YouTube, blogging technologies  that allow us to express what Nick called the death of distance, the end of distance. It explains our contemporary cult of authenticity, this idea that we always have to be true to ourselves. It's, of course, a manifestation of a particularly corrupted nature of democracy, a world where everything is intimate, everything is personalized. Nick described it in scientific terms I guess as not only the end of distance, the end of depth, and the end of objectivity. Everything, then, in this media, in this world of smart technology is personalized. Everything is intimate. Everything is telling the world what we think. Everything is confirming what we already think. So this so called smart technology  I don't know where we get this term. The person who came up with the term, smart technology, should be spanked, at least metaphorically, because I don't know where the word came from. There's nothing smart about personalized, intimate technology. It simply confirms our misplaced ideal that the world revolves around us. It's a preCopernican notion. And ironically it's technology confirming that. Technology by definition, as I'm sure some Frankfurt theorist like Walter Benjamin once argued, technology is by definition romantic and nostalgic and reactionary. So don't accuse Nick and I of being that. We are the progressives. We are the ones looking forward. It's technologists, or people with a belief in the idea of technology as salvation who are reactionaries, they  they're the ones who want to drive us back, like Rousseau, to some idealized community. So what do we have? We have then a technology of intimacy, which is resulting, in cultural and social terms, in a more and more personalized culture, a platform where we tell the world what we're doing, what we're thinking. It represents the disappearance, the death not only of distance but of communication. We struggle more and more to talk to one another. Sherry Turkle wrote a brilliant book called, Alone Together. This technology is indeed making us alone together. It's a technology not only, as Nick said, of distraction, but of atomization, of alienation. This is Durkheim on steroids. This is a world of profound disorientation and destruction of the community. So what we have, then, in epistemological terms, is the disappearance of that kind of objectivity that Nick talks about. I think David described it  he thinks this is a good thing, epistemological chaos. Everyone saying everything at the same time, and no one listening to anyone else. The ultimate  the ultimate consequence, of course, of this is the selfie. This is a selfie culture. This is a culture where the ultimate expression is photographing ourselves in front of a masterpiece, in front of Auschwitz, in front of someone jumping off the Bay Bridge. These are true examples of selfie culture. Meanwhile, what's going on? David celebrates the narrow gatekeepers that are being destroyed. But of course, since we have this socalled smart technology, what has happened to those gatekeepers? We're seeing not only the death of distance, but the death of newspapers, the death of recorded music, the death of the professional creative class, the people who made their living thinking, the people who have made their living writing books, the people who made their living writing articles for newspapers, the people who made their living taking photographs. That kind of professionalism is in crisis. Some people even believe that the creative professional is a thing of the past. So, what we have is this double whammy. On the one hand, personalization, intimacy, driven more and more into ourselves, into an echo chamber culture, where we never listen to anything anyone else is saying, particularly if it dissonates with us. And on the other hand, the death of a professional culture. That is why you should believe that smart culture  whoops  smart technology  that was Freudian  smart technology  is certainly making us dumb. Thank you."

    "data": "Perhaps it's fitting that it falls to a woman and an Australian to rebut that particular moment. I find myself delightfully, at the end of this conversation, thinking about the proposition, is smart technology making us dumb? I think it's probably ironic that we started this debate using a smart device to vote on that proposition, and that most of you in the room said you had smart technology on your persons, even though you've now disabled it for radio. When I was given the task of taking on this proposition, as someone who did debate in high school  which is a long time ago  I was struck by the impulse to want to deconstruct the question. It's an anthropological approach too, right? And ask What is smart technology? Echoing Andrew's concern of what on earth that might mean. What does dumb mean? Is smart/dumb the only binary pair that we could have, and is dumb necessarily, as an anthropologist, I might want to ask, a bad thing? I mean, clearly we're putting a set of cultural and moral values around dumbness that are interesting. Smart technology is now being described as romantic, progressive, reactionary, a rectangle, and a gatekeeper, all of which is an interesting set of a baggage to put on a phone, the Internet, algorithms, the internet of things, and big data. Nonetheless, we have done that. So, David said to me, No, Genevieve, don't deconstruct the argument. So I'm taking his advice. I am, however, going to want to suggest that smart technology has made us smart in some unexpected ways. It's made us more responsive. It's made us more engaged. And in the case of both Andrew and I, it's made us more enraged and I'm not necessarily convinced that's a bad thing. So, how might I go about proving that? Well, I think there's a couple of places you'd look to. And many of them are outside of this room, and Manhattan, and outside of the United States. Smart technology makes us smart and it makes us safer. If you were to look, in the last year, I can pull you examples from all over the world. In many African countries and on the Indian subcontinent, mobile phones and text messages are used by governments to send out health warnings and preventative health messages. When the Ebola outbreak was taking place, messages were sent on smartphones to tell people how to handle themselves, their communities, and the bodies that they were encountering. Hardly dumb, right? In Australia, where I come from, all the volunteer fire services, which is how we keep ourselves safe in the fire season, use a geolocated app service that sends out notifications to Australians to tell them there's a bush fire near them, to tell them what to do in a highfire danger day, which isn't always obvious. And how to think about being safer and ultimately smarter about how we inhabit a dangerous landscape. In the United States, you have the Amber alert, something I'm sure many of you hope to never see on your telephones. But when you do, you know what to do. It's about making a community and the kids in it hopefully safer and ultimately making all of us smarter about danger. And it will be hard to argue with what’s happened in Nepal over the last three and a half weeks as people have mobilized all sorts of technology to bring both relief and comfort to a community that was clearly struggling. In all of those cases, is smart technology making us dumber? I hardly think so. And if you were to move further out from that frame and think about cultural knowledge, we talked a lot about intelligence, we talked a lot about book learning. But let's think a little bit about cultural knowledge. I'm the child of an anthropologist. I grew up with indigenous people in Australia. I spent a lot of time in indigenous communities, and it's been fascinating to watch over the last 20 years as those communities have embraced new technologies to do old things. The Ngadjuri with whom my family have worked for the last 20 years, used the internet to tell their stories. They like the fact that newspapers are being archived because they can use the stories in those about their colonial contact and argue about how to regain their land. The Diri and the Kukuda [spelled phonetically] are using IOT sensors to combine traditional knowledge about climate with state based knowledge about climate change to think about how to occupy their land better. And the Anangu in central Australia have an electronic medical records system that is a marvel of the world and has changed the health outcomes in that community. Is smart tech, in those instances, making those communities dumber? I hardly think so. And is it about a vacuum and people just talking to each other? I don't think that's the right way to think about it, either. Moving closer to home, at Intel, we're deeply concerned about diversity in the tech community, about diversity in STEM education. And one of our challenges frequently is to convince young women and ethnic minorities that there's room for them inside the sciences. And one of the ways you do that is by telling the stories of people who've been there before. Finding the stories of women pioneers and underrepresented minorities who were pioneers used to be difficult. It's nice to be in New York for me. I get to go visit Judy Chicago's dinner table at the Brooklyn Museum, and I think about how hard it was for her to reclaim all of those women's names and how much easier it is to do it today. My Twitter feed just recently brought me the name of Sharla Boheim [spelled phonetically] who actually was the original lead name on pocket  packet simulation technology. You don't need to know what it is, but it's the foundation of the internet. And she was involved. Until quite recently, people didn't know that. So is using smart technology to tell our stories and tell them widely and bring more people into the conversation making us dumb? I certainly hope not, because it's something I participate in regularly. And almost last but by no means least, let's tackle the notion of community and citizenship. Andrew brought it up. Let's take it on a little bit more seriously. What have we used smart technology for from the last 18 months to think about notions of citizenship beyond the United States and within it? Were the students who were protesting at Mong Kok in Hong Kong say that smart technology was making them dumb? I don't think so. Would  and I'm never going to get this man's name right, so I apologize in advance  but would Feidin Santana think that he was doing something dumb when he took out his camera phone and recorded a policeman shooting someone in South Carolina? And we watched the video rocket around America and drive yet a further conversation about race and violence, and what it means to be a citizen? We can dismiss hashtag activism  such a great phrase  as being a sort of a fleeting thing, right? Whether it's #blacklivesmatter, #notallmen, #SOSblackAustralia from my hometown. But truthfully the use of technology to propel conversations about citizenship is hardly new. A photograph made a huge difference in how we talked about the Vietnam War. The radio and vinyl records, which are making a comeback, I'll have you know, helped distribute the word of Martin Luther King. And the suffragettes really liked a good typewriter. So is smart technology in those cases making us dumb? I don't think so. Does it mean we still have a lot of work to do as citizens? Absolutely. And lest I end on a depressing note, because I realize being told you have more work is depressing, let me just reflect briefly on something else. Smart technology is also in our everyday lives. And some of those things we may not think about as making us smart, but they're certainly changing, I would argue, for the better personhood. Here's my last example: Online dating, because you should end on a good note. When I was in India doing fieldwork many years ago, a place that had been embracing this technology for a long time, a woman said to me, Getting a husband is just a database problem. And she said the matrimonial time  matrimonial classified section of the Times of India changed everything for us because the database got bigger. So, let us imagine, from changing ideas of citizenship and safety, to ideas of romance to ideas of what it means to be in the world, it's really hard, I imagine, for any of us to sit in this room and to agree to the proposition that smart technology is making us dumb. So along with David, I think you should emphatically vote against it. Thank you."

    "data": "Reasonable people can disagree about whether capital punishment is a morally appropriate sanction for the most heinous of crimes. And our opponents place tremendous value on retribution by execution. They think that is an incredible benefit. But I think when you reason about this as a public policy issue, and that's why we're here, and you look at the costs and benefits of having a death penalty versus life without parole at a maximum security prison, you're going to reach the same conclusion that six states have reached in the last six years: the death penalty doesn't work. It should be repealed and abolished. What are the costs? The death penalty creates an undeniable and unacceptable risk of executing innocents. The death penalty does not deter. The National Academy of Sciences recently reviewed all of the studies and found no evidence of a deterrent effect. And common sense tells you that, because the states that execute the most, like Texas and Virginia, do not have lower homicide rates, do not have lower crime rates, than the states that don't have the death penalty. The death penalty is administered arbitrarily. It depends on the quality of your representation. And who has money and your race often turns on  often determines what kind of representation you get. The death penalty also depends on where you're tried. It's incredibly arbitrary in this sense. It's only 2 percent of counties in the United States that are responsible for 60  56 percent of the executions  of the death sentences and 52 percent of executions. There are race effects that Diann is going to talk to you about at some length, particularly having to do with the race of the victim. And the death penalty, as Diann will also address at greater length, does nothing to increase or insure public safety. So, this undermines the fair administration of justice. Take California. We know that in California there are over 700 people on death row. And they haven't had an execution for years. And they have hundreds of people who have been convicted and sentenced to death that don't have lawyers in a postconviction setting, and they're closing down civil courts. And the dockets are clogged, and this led to a judge recently in California saying, It is the gridlock, it is the  in California that makes the death penalty unconstitutional, because it is freakish and it is arbitrarily applied. You are more likely to die of natural causes after 24 years in prison in California than you are to be executed. Now, there should not be any disagreement about one moral and one factual question, and that is the unacceptable risk of executing innocent people. Bob talked about the Boston Marathon bomber trial, but let's not forget that in April  early April Anthony Hinton walked off death row in Alabama. Bryan Stevenson  he had been on death row for 30 years. He was convicted based on bogus ballistics evidence. And the prosecution held back exculpatory evidence in that case for nine years. And he had an ineffective lawyer as the Supreme Court itself ruled. Just this week a young man in New Orleans, Mr. Stewart  Kia Stewart, was exonerated with the help of the prosecutors and the Innocence Project in New Orleans. He was tried for murder in New Orleans, represented by law students at Tulane Law School and a supervisor that had no experience in murder cases. This kind of stuff goes on all across the country, and we've got to face up to it. What is the error rate of convicting people that are innocent? Sam Gross at the University of Michigan Law School submitted a paper in the National Academy of Science Proceedings and showed that when you look at capital convictions, you can demonstrate on innocence grounds a 4.1 percent error rate, 4.1 percent error rate. I mean, would you accept that in flying airplanes? I mean, really. Now, there's no doubt innocents have also been executed. I hope you're all familiar with the work of our colleague, Jim Liebman, from Columbia Law School, documenting the wrongful execution of Carlos DeLuna. And I certainly hope you're aware of the case of Cameron Todd Willingham, who was executed in Texas based on what now is acknowledged by the state itself to be bogus arson evidence for an arson murder, killing his three children. And we now have evidence that there was a jailhouse snitch that committed perjury by his own admission, and you can demonstrate it in the case. And now the Texas Bar has brought the prosecutor in that case up on charges, because he knew about a deal with the jailhouse snitch that he never revealed. Now, that is unbelievable. You cannot anymore kid yourself on the fact that innocents have been executed due to junk forensic science, prosecutorial misconduct, law enforcement misconduct, ineffective lawyers. This system is incapable not just of determining who's guilty or innocence in the final analysis when charging them with the ultimate punishment but reliably figuring out who should die and who shouldn't. We shouldn't be tinkering with the machinery of death, and we see prosecutors telling us this every day. Mark Earley, the attorney general of Virginia, who presided and brought about 36 executions, has just come to the position as he left office that The death penalty is based on a false utopian premise. That false premise is that we have had and do have and will have 100 percent accuracy in death penalty convictions and executions. Who should live and who should die? I can no longer support the imposition of a penalty so final in nature yet so fraught with failures. Go look at the statement of Marty Stroud, a prosecutor in a Caddo Parish, Shreveport, Louisiana  Glenn Ford, 30 years on death row, innocent. Marty prosecuted him. He recently gave this statement, he said it'll be his only one, where he said, How did this happen? I knew that the defense lawyers were  had never tried a capital case, and I wanted to win. We all wanted to win. I was 32 years old, and I wanted to win, and I didn't see it. So, I leave this to you: our friend, George Will. All right, George Will has said that Conservatives  capital punishment is a government program, so skepticism is in order."

    "data": "There are three reasons. The first reason is that for some crimes, such as the marathon bombing, any lesser penalty is simply a travesty of justice. And Professor Blecker will talk about that in his turn. The second reason is incapacitation. An executed killer never kills again. We cannot say that for certain with a killer sentenced to life without parole. In the cases that I personally have worked on, there are half a dozen cases of murder of people who have been killed by killers who were sentenced to life in prison already, before they committed the murder. One contracted out the murder of the witnesses to his first murder. Another one killed multiple people within prison. Another one escaped from prison and killed people after he left. There  life without parole is not a zerorisk option. If we choose life in prison for killers, we do risk killing innocent people. Then there is deterrence. It is a basic principle of human behavior that incentives matter, that if you raise the cost of doing anything, fewer people will choose to do that thing. Logically, then, you would think that an effective enforced death penalty would save innocent lives for deterrence. And we should demand a very convincing evidence by anyone who claims to the contrary. There are empirical studies, but it's not a hard science. The one thing all experts agree on is that the case has not been proved either way, for or against deterrence. It certainly is not true that deterrence has been disproved, and the report Mr. Scheck referred to did not say that there is no evidence in favor of deterrence. There are a number of empirical studies showing a deterrent effect estimating between five and 18 innocent lives saved per execution. These studies have their critics to be sure. The authors have responded to the critics and shown that the results still hold, even considering the criticism. The bottom line is we should not get rid of a penalty that is independently justified by just [unintelligible]  by justice if doing so risks taking innocent lives through lost deterrents. The arguments against the death penalty are like a game of whackamole. Every time we refute one of the arguments they just come up with another one. The old claim from the old days was that the death penalty was discriminatorily enforced against African American defendants. That claim was uniformly refuted by study after study, including the defendant's own. Then they came to a backup claim that the death penalty was discriminatorily not imposed on murderers who kill black victims. That  the evidence there is more mixed. A lot of times somebody with an ax to grind will come out with a study claiming that and a reanalysis of the data taking into account all the relevant variables, will show that that effect just disappears into the statistical grass. Then they fall back to the claim of excessive cost versus life without parole. The problem there is that the studies claiming that are seriously flawed. They often fail to consider the very high costs of medical care for a person all the way to the end of his life if he's truly going to be held in prison to natural death. They typically include unnecessary costs as costs of the death penalty. In California the study that was cited to claim the excessive cost of the death penalty counted as the number one cost of the death penalty the cost of keeping a person on death row for 26 years of appeals. Well, three fourths of that cost is unnecessary. In a capital case where there is no doubt who did it, which is most capital cases, you can get it done in six years, which Virginia did with the D.C. sniper. Risk of executing the innocent is much less than the other side says and it's less today than it was say 15 years ago with all the greater scrutiny that we have on forensic science. In most capital cases, again, there's no doubt whatever who did it. The claim you may have heard of 152 innocent people, that list has been debunked. People on that list have been proved conclusively guilty by DNA. The same DNA advances that they prove that case guilty were also used for post mortem testing of people who had been already convicted and already executed. The other side thought they were going to hit the Holy Grail and they were going to find conclusive evidence through this postmortem testing of an innocent person executed. In fact, none of them panned out and their poster boy was found conclusively guilty. Now we have the Willingham case. I don't have time for details, but bear in mind there are two sides to that story. There is material in that case. There is evidence in that case you did not read in New Yorker magazine and that will be coming out later I'm sure. There are a handful of cases, though, of people who were really innocent and who were really sentenced to death. But ask yourself where would those people be if they had been sentenced to life without parole instead? In most cases they would still be in prison and they would never get out, because an inmate who is sentenced to death gets a government paid lawyer for the second review of his case and the third review of his case and that is where this evidence often comes out. Someone sentenced to life in prison, he may have longer time to prove innocence, but he doesn't have the resources, and so in most cases nobody's going to care about his case. The risk of an innocent person dying in prison and never getting out is greater if he's sentenced to life in prison than it is if he's sentenced to death. So the death penalty is an important part of our system. It's important for justice. Reforms are needed to make the process focus more on actual guilt and innocence and less on other issues. And in the process we can make it more sure, more swift, less costly, and more just. So, let's mend it, not end it, and I ask you to vote no on this motion. Thank you."

    "data": "The death penalty should be abolished because it fails to enhance public safety. We all want a criminal justice system that is effective and secure, one that creates more safety and less violence, but that is not what the death penalty is doing. In states where the death penalty is used, as you've already heard, we have a higher homicide rate. In the South, for example, which has the highest number of executions  there's the highest homicide rate. In the Northeast, by contrast, which has the lowest execution rate, we have a lower murder rate. These differences tell us that we have to take a closer look at what works and what doesn't, and take a commonsense approach to public safety. If we take a commonsense approach to public safety, you must vote in favor of the motion to abolish the death penalty. Everyone wants a neighborhood that's safe and communities that are strong. And in order to do that, we have to focus on the root causes of crime. We know why crime and violence happens, when other things are neglected. Mental health services, safe and affordable housing, schools that prepare us for our future jobs, and jobs that pay living wages. When the nation's police chiefs were surveyed about what they thought our priorities should be when it comes to enhancing public safety, the death penalty ranked last consistently. Some even went so far as to say that the death penalty was an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars. What do police chiefs think should be our focus and attention? It should be on more resources for law enforcement, particularly training, drug treatment, and again, a stronger economy with better jobs. Most of these police chiefs also thought the death penalty wasn't a deterrent. Why? Based on their experience. Because perpetrators rarely consider the consequences when they engage in violence. More evidence that the death penalty is disconnected from at true public safety objective is the fact that it's used so rarely. In 2014, we only had 72 new death sentences in the entire country. And execution rates continue to drop as well. In 2013, we had 39 executions. In 2014, we had 35. The death penalty was used  executions took place in mostly three states. 80 percent of the executions in 2014 took place in Texas, Missouri, and Florida. And even in those states that used the death penalty frequently, the death penalty is really relegated to pockets within those states. Abstract justifications for the death penalty have little meaning in a context where it's used so rarely and unpredictably. The death penalty does, however, reinforce our nation's sad and ugly history of slavery, Jim Crow segregation, and racial inequality. A substantial body of research spanning 40 years – it remarkably, consistently shows that race, particularly race of the victim, is the singlemost reliable predictor of whether you're going to get a death sentence. The death penalty is rarely used when the victim is a person of color, particularly African American men, even though African American men are most likely to be the victims of homicide. And that figure correlates with the recent report from the Vera Institute, that found that as a society, we provide very little services for African American men, that we don't take the victimization of African American men seriously. And so, that statistic is borne out by what we're actually doing as a society. We're also seeing, in recent studies, that the most likely person to receive a death sentence is an African American person who is convicted of killing a white victim. We have a system that treats some lives as worth more than others. And we have current information about how, as a society, we are two sets of people living in the same space with very different experiences, with our interactions with law enforcement. Under those circumstances, we cannot have a system that decides who lives and who dies. The death penalty is an outdated practice that is hindering our nation's forward progress. Therefore, I urge you to vote for the motion, to Abolish the Death Penalty."

    "data": "So, let the punishment fit the crime. We've mouthed that for centuries. But do we believe it? Do we practice it? No. Not at all. We mock it in the very administration of our criminal justice system, because the grand irony is, however counterintuitive this is, that inside prison, it's nobody's job to punish. Nobody's. I hear Diann RustTierney talking about safety, I think I'm listening to the corrections officers, because that's what I asked them, what their mission is, what are you trying to accomplish here? Their answer uniformly, speaking almost with one voice, Safety. I want to keep the public safe from these guys, I want to keep these guys safe from each other, and I want to keep the staff safe from the inmates. Safety, safety, safety. And then I ask, But what about their crime? What do they deserve? And their answer is, It's none of my business what a guy did out there. I'm only concerned with one thing: how does he behave once he's inside? So for lifers, life begins when the sentence of life begins. From the corrections point of view, it's all a clean slate, and it's nobody's job to punish. Look at the mission statements of the departments of corrections. They guide corrections. You will not find the word, punishment, in any mission statement in any part  in any department of corrections in the United States, or its synonyms, not one. So, it's no surprise that given the fact that no part of their mission is to punish, that they run their prisons in such a way that life becomes relatively pleasant. Now, what am I talking about? I mean, Barry Scheck talks about life without parole inside of a maximum security prison. For one thing, you may not be sentenced to life without parole and end up in a maximum security prison. You're going to start out there, but you may not end up there. In many states that I have visited, a perfectly wellbehaved killer, the most vicious of killers, who prey on the vulnerable, are likely to be the most cowardly of killers, will be perfectly compliant once they're arrested. So, they will be pussycats, and they will be there for a long time. So, they will be reliable, and, therefore, they will be given the best lifestyles, the best hustles inside the prison. It's fundamentally perverse. Those who deserve it least will often suffer most. Those who deserve it most will have the best lives in prison and may well be transferred to a high medium security prison where they'll be playing softball and volleyball. And, by the way, you can do that in a maximum security prison in Riverbend. I watched convicted killers playing softball in a softball field with chalk base pads and umpires in uniform, and not prison uniform, and softball uniforms, highfiving it after they hit homeruns. The reality of life without parole, given the way that prison is administered, given the television sets, given the firstrun movies in many cases, given recreation, given the hours and hours outside of the cell daily, the reality is it's nobody's job to punish and there is no punishment going on. The closest we come to serious punishment left in this society is the death penalty. So, when you consider the question, you can't consider it in isolation. You have to consider it in context, that we are a society that is increasingly disavowing punishment itself. Now, we advocates for the death penalty have to struggle against different groups. One group, for example, are the indiscriminate Kill them all set, Person kills, kill them. They don't want to hear about mercy. They don't want to  they don't want to hear about mitigation, just kill him. They are indiscriminate. On the other side, there are the indiscriminates whose heart bleeds for every killer, Evil? No such thing, or, We're all evil. Punishment? Let those without any sin punish, we all have sin, so, therefore, nobody punishes. And a third group we have to set ourselves in opposition to are our supposed allies who say, No, we're against the death penalty. That's not nearly enough. You really want to punish him? Give him life without parole. Let him die every day in prison. Well, the fact is they don't die every day in prison or at least no differently than we all die every day a little bit. When you examine what goes on, life takes on new meaning, new pleasures, new communities. So when you consider the motion, don't consider it in isolation. Consider the actual alternative in practice. And yet I would argue for the death penalty separately from that. Some people deserve to die, and we have the obligation to execute them. Now, who are they? And can we determine them adequately in advance? Yes, we can. We can do it through definition, and we can do it through enumeration. In terms of definition, it's a function of the attitude, the cruel, the callous, the wanton. And so I would reserve the death penalty for essentially terrorists, mass murderers, murderers of vulnerable victims, especially children, rapist murderers, contract killers, torture killers, and it  so definite  we cannot precisely and fully define it in advance, but we can get to the core. I offer a model death penalty statute based upon thousands of hours and years talking to killers and listening to them. And we can also do it by enumeration. Joshua Komisarjevsky broke into the Petit house, took Michaela and Hayley, tied them to their beds in their upstairs bedroom for six hours. Took Michaela, repeatedly sexually abused her, took cell phone photos of her, and sent them to the friends. And then in order to eliminate the evidence, before he left took gasoline and doused her on and around her and her sister and burnt them to death, alive. He deserves to die. Fedell Caffey and Jacqueline Williams, they wanted another child. She already had three. So, what did they do? They got Debra Evens. They cut the fetus out of her. And then to eliminate the witnesses, they killed her 10yearold daughter, abducted her eightyearold son, and murdered him. They deserve to die. Danny Rolling, the ninja killer, terrorized the whole town of Starke, Florida, broke into houses, tortured, mutilated, murdered. He deserved to die. Lawrence Brewer took an innocent black guy walking down the street, and for sport this white supremacist dragged him to his death in an unspeakable torture. We can enumerate them in advance, not only who should we kill, how should we kill, not by lethal injection, a terrible method, and not because it might cause pain, but because it certainly causes confusion. It confuses punishment with medicine. It's all part of the deeper issue. And so ultimately we get to the question of, why? Why should we punish? Not for the sake of deterrence, that would be using a person as a means to our own ends. That would be sending a message by killing a person. That's immoral. Not for incapacitation, I disagree with Kent. We have the obligation to build escape proof prisons and safe prisons. We should kill for one reason and one reason only: They deserve it, in three words. In one word: justice."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you. Well, it's a pleasure to be here, and thank you for the opportunity. The president has certainly exceeded his constitutional power by waging war without Congressional authorization for the following reasons. First, as Nick Rosenkranz mentioned at the top, the text of the Constitution, the history, are actually quite clear on the idea that power over armed forces, power to commit those troops, to make war wherever they do it, is shared between the executive and the Congress. The executive would have the power as commander in chief to superintend the armed forces. He would also have the power to repel sudden attacks in the event our nation came under attack, but the vast majority of the power over the armed forces, and over war making in the United States, if you look in the Constitution, it's there under Article I Section 8. It's given to Congress. They have the power to raise and support an army, to provide and maintain a navy, to issue letters of mark and reprisal, an old fashioned way of saying to appoint agents or to hire agents of the U.S. government, who would carry out lesser military actions against our enemies. And of course, Congress also has the power to declare war. The reason this matters, the text matters, is because the purpose of the framers was also clear. The president would have the power to act in our national defense if it was necessary, but actually commencing war, risking huge sums in national blood and treasure, that no one man should have the power to do. Madison said, In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to the executive. The trust and the temptation would be too great for any one man. Now, my opponents will tell you that it's not so much what the text of the Constitution says, or even why the Constitution said it that way, but what matters is what we've actually done, and in particular, what presidents have actually done in the past, say, 50 or 60 years of the nation's history, because before that they almost always went to Congress to at least get an authorization for the use of force. So, let's set aside for the moment the notion that it's a little bit of a weird way to interpret the Constitution by saying, well, it means whatever the president has been doing, and thinks he can get away with, in every  any given administration. Let's set that aside for a minute. Let's also set aside the problem of that methodology, which is how do we decide we agree on what particular presidents did, and more importantly, why they were doing it. Were they acting in national defense or did they have a clear sense even in their own minds of what the purpose was for deploying force in a given case? Let's set both of those aside for now and make it clear that no president in the United States has declared or asserted an unlimited power to make war without congressional authorization. The Office of Legal Counsel  right, this is the office in the Department of Justice that counsels the president on how much power he has to use force abroad  recognizes in its memoranda limits that the president has to follow when he uses force without congressional authorization. And even this president, his OLC said Look, you can only do this without Congress if it's in the national interest, and if the force that you're using is less than war. Why does it matter? Well, of course, because the Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war. So if what you're doing is actual war, then you actually have to go to Congress. How do you tell the difference between what's war and what's not war by this president's own metric? Well, in Libya, the last time he used force without congressional authorization, he said it was because, this is a short term commitment, right? We're not going to be there very long. We're going to get in. We're going to get out. We're going to have a very limited mission, right? Just protecting civilians pursuant to a U.N. Security Council Resolution, and there will be minimal risk to Americans in any event, right? The problem today is that the conflict against ISIL in Iraq and Syria is, even by the president's own metric, war, in a constitutional sense. The president said when he committed troops, when he expanded our operations in Iraq and Syria, that this is going to take some time. He announced a broad mission. Our mission is not to protect particular individuals or even keep the peace. Our mission is broadly to destroy and degrade another organization, ISIL, the Islamic State as it calls itself. By January of this year, the United States had carried out close to 10,000 airstrikes in the region; we have 7,000 contractors in our employee  in our employ on the ground; and 4,500 military personnel already serving in the theater. Okay, my opponents will say, but that's fine. So what matters is not even so much what the president has done in the past. What matters is what works. We need the flexibility. The president needs the ability to respond to new threats, to new dangers. And that does matter. But in this case, that's not what's going on. There has been more than enough time, there remains enough time for Congress to authorize the use of force. Indeed, the president has gone to Congress and asked it to authorize the use of force in the case of ISIL. There is plenty, further, of strategic cause for Congress to authorize force. Congressional authorization is an incredibly important signal. It signals our allies that we're serious about the fight. It signals our enemies that we're serious about the fight. And it signals, particularly in a conflict like this, to what our security friends call, Wavering neutrals in the region, right? Those folks who looked at what we did in the past conflicts, they looked at Abu Ghraib, they looked at Guantanamo, they said, I don't buy the United States, and it shows them we're as good as our word. For all of these reasons, the framers thought so; it remains a good idea. You need to vote for the resolution. Congress needs to authorize the use of force. Thank you."

    "data": "I agree. I'm not going to dismiss the text and the history. I'm not going to rely on the practices of the last 60 years. I agree. Congress should be on record about this. Congress should authorize war against the Islamic State. And I believe, and my partner, Professor Amar, believe that Congress has, that the Authorization for the Use of Military Force in 2001 empowers the president to use deadly force against the Islamic State. Now, you may be told that the AUMF, as we’ll call it, of 2001 authorized retaliation against al Qaeda for the atrocities on 9/11, and therefore, it can't apply to the Islamic State because the Islamic State didn't exist in 2001, and furthermore, that since it has distanced itself from the core alQaeda leadership, it can't be responsible for the 9/11 attack. To see if this is as clinching as it sounds, let's take a close look at the joint resolution adopted by both houses of Congress and signed into law by the president that we'll be discussing tonight. That law is not simply about holding an organization responsible for the past attacks on the U.S., but about deterring new attacks. It is not even about one organization, alQaeda, or about plural groups. The AUMF advanced in 2001 provided for the use  and I will quote  of all necessary and appropriate force in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by organizations, plural, that the president determines authorized the terrorist attacks of September the 11th. Unquote. If the president determines that the use of force against the Islamic State is necessary and appropriate in order to prevent future acts of terrorism by the network of which the Islamic State was admittedly a part, which had authorized the attacks of 9/11, then Congress's language is quite sufficient to authorize the actions the president proposes. To vote for our opponents, you must conclude that there is no rational way the president could make this determination, that there is no conceivable way he could find that action against the Islamic State might deter the loose network of shifting alliances that is united in its objective to found an Islamist caliphate, and by acts of terror like 9/11, to intimidate the United States from acquiescing in this objective. It is significant that the Congress agrees with our view. So, they have recently passed  as we all know  legislation appropriating funds for air attacks on the Islamic State, which they would scarcely have done if they believed the president could not constitutionally execute the legislation they passed. It is also significant that the federal courts in the Guantanamo cases have unanimously accepted the view that the Islamic State is an associated force of AlQaeda, bringing the Islamic State within the ambit of the charters for the use of force that Congress has passed. Moreover, there are ample precedents for using congressional authorizations for war to apply to subsequent groups when later hostilities emerge where conflict initially authorized. The most pertinent example is not the last 60 years, but from the Philippines War in 1898, in which U.S. forces, having defeated the Spanish against whom Congress had authorized war, found themselves attacked by Philippine insurgents, who had actually fought the Spanish. U.S. forces proceeded to wage war against the Philippine insurgents without any further congressional authorization, choosing instead to rely on the initial declaration of war against Spain. No one doubts that the Islamic State emerged out of the conflict in Iraq, authorized by the AUMF of 2002, nor that it was created as an arm of AlQaeda  its original name was Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia  against whom the AUMF of 2001 was directed. There are other examples of Albania, Croatia, Slovakia in World War II that stand to the principle that fresh authority is not needed if the new belligerent emerges from an originally authorized conflict and wages war against us. Finally, it is simply absurd to hold that the Islamic State would be free from those preexisting authorizations on the ground that it has changed its name or denounced its former leaders. While this might make some sort of sense in a world of nationstates, in the wars we are currently fighting, new groups pop up all the time, change their names, denounce their leaders. Just two weeks ago Boko Haram announced it was going to be part of the Islamic State. Would we really want a rule that required a fresh congressional statute every time a terrorist leader changed his name after he'd attacked us or tweeted an attack on his former allies? Congress, the courts, and the president all agree on the constitutional and statutory proposition that Professor Amar and I are asserting. If you disagree, you must have good constitutional grounds. That's right. In the text, in the structure, in the history, you must find the case law, the historical precedents, the strategic practicality, which counts too  and only then can you be compelled to disagree."

    "data": "Thank you. The president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without Congressional authorization, or to put tonight's debate resolution another way, the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation. You may have heard that second formulation before. It's how candidate Obama described the limits of presidential war powers when he was asked about it during campaign 2008. And it came up a lot about three years later when President Obama unilaterally launched a sevenmonth bombing campaign against Libya. Not only was there no actual or imminent threat to the nation in that case, but 10 days into the bombing, the president's own secretary of defense went on Meet the Press and admitted that Libya wasn't a vital interest to the United States. The president took us into our latest war in the Middle East, the ongoing conflict against ISIS, last August. Here again there was no imminent threat. We have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland, President Obama told the country in his nationally televised address, and yet he waited six months and over 2,000 airstrikes before he got around to sending a draft request for authorization to Congress, along with a cover note insisting that existing statutes provide me with all the authority I need to wage war anyway. The central basis for that claim, as Professor Bobbitt notes, is the 2001 AUMF, the resolution that Congress passed three days after 9/11 empowering the president to take military action against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11th attacks, or harbored those who did. Now, not exclusively, but principally, obviously, alQaeda and the Taliban. And judging by what the people in Congress said about it at the time, the people who passed it certainly didn't think they were committing the United States to openended, multigenerational war. Now, nearly 14 years later, this war has gone on 10 years longer than World War II, four years longer than Vietnam, and counting. Under the 9/11 AUMF President Obama has launched six times the number of drone strikes as President Bush against groups with evermore tenuous and remote connections to the language  to the resolution's language and original target. Two years ago Obama officials told the Washington Post that they were increasingly concerned that the law is being stretched to its legal breaking point. That was before they'd stretched it still further. President Obama now argues that the 9/11 AUMF allows him to go after  go to war with groups like ISIS that have not just distanced themselves from alQaeda, but have been denounced and excommunicated by alQaeda. It may even allow, and the theory  the administration's theory of the 2001 AUMF, it may even allow him to go after ISIS’s offshoots and sympathizers as socalled associated forces of a force that alQaeda refuses to associate with. Earlier this month at a Senate hearing, President Obama's new secretary of defense acknowledged that the resolution may be broad enough to allow the president to wage war in Nigeria against Boko Haram, which recently pledged allegiance to ISIS on Twitter. In fact, the administration's interpretation of the 9/11 AUMF is so broad they can't tell you how broad it is. For one thing, who we're at war with is classified. In testimony last May, the Pentagon's general counsel told the Senate that which groups the administration claims legal authority to target under the AUMF, well, that's something that they're just not prepared to discuss in an open session. Meanwhile, Obama administration officials admit that there's no end in sight to worldwide war making. The war on terror will go on at least 10 to 20 years more, which means, I suppose, that in 2032, when we're all filled with excitement about the impending presidential contest between Chelsea Clinton and George P. Bush  we can rest assured that the winner will get to use the September 2001 AUMF as the basis for his or her presidential kill list. This is not how constitutional democracies are supposed to make the most important decision that any society can make. President Obama has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization, but it's worse than that. The arguments he's advanced will make it even easier for future presidents to do the same. I urge you to vote, Yes, on the motion. Thank you."

    "data": "Good evening. So you've heard this expression a couple of times from our distinguished opponents, AUMF. Let's just slow down a second and hear what the AUMF is. It's the authorization of the use of military force. Here's the resolution, The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging War Without Congressional Authorization. The AUMF is a congressional thing. It's a selfdescribed authorization of the use of military force; that is waging war. Sometimes  you know, I don't know how many of you have kids, but I've got three, and sometimes my wife and I say like, What part of, 'No,' did you not understand? What part of the authorization of the use of military force are we not understanding here? Let's go over, once again, what that statute says, because we've heard, Well, Congress didn't intend this and didn't intend that. Congress uses words to express its intent. If they didn't want an authorization to be temporally openended, you know what they can do? They can put a sunset provision in that authorization that says, This sunsets after a certain point in time. They did not do that. And they do do that in other laws. See the Patriot Act. In fact, what they say in the law very explicitly in this authorization is to prevent, quote, any future attack against the United States by these various organizations. Let me go over once again what it says, The president  the president  is authorized to use all  what part of all don't you  necessary and appropriate force against nations, with an S, organizations, with an S, and persons he determines  and I think I will concede in brackets  in good faith and reasonably, on the basis of information that he has that not all of us have in this room, frankly, that he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the 9/11 attacks, or harbored such organizations or persons, okay? in order to prevent any future attack, okay? Now, if you know just general legal principles, you can have persons and organizations, who are aiders and abettors after the fact. They're harborers after the fact, and that's what ISIS is. It's an offshoot of alQaeda, as you've heard. Here's what winning a war actually means: sometimes you smash one organization, and it splinters, and now you have to deal with the splinters, you know? Hercules is making some progress when he slices off each of the heads of the hydra, but initially you get two that grow back. But it's the same basic hydra, and you've got to deal with the root. It's the same problem. So  and the president gets to make this determination, at least if it's in good faith. These, ladies and gentlemen, ISIL, ISIS, involve some of the same persons. You have not heard our distinguished opponents deny that, and I'd like to hear if they deny that they're some of the same persons. And that's not fighting everyone around the world at any time. No one in this room is a member  was a member of alQaeda, a leader. So it's only certain organizations that have the same persons. ISIL and ISIS are using the same tactics, the tactics of terror, as al Qaeda. They have the same murderous purpose, and frankly it's a murderous purpose to murder us, and our ideals, and  which takes me to the fourth point  they have the same target, us, U.S. That's U.S., the United States, that's us, small U, small S, no periods. Okay? Same persons. At least a subset of them. Same terror tactics. Same murderous purpose. Same target. You heard my distinguished colleague, Professor Bobbitt, channel Shakespeare. What's in a name? You know, so they  so they changed their name. Are you going to allow the same  you know, this offshoot entity to escape the clear language of this authorization, which is about preventing future attacks, just because they changed their name? I invoked Lincoln earlier. By the way, you know that Civil War wasn’t a formal declaration of war back then. But Lincoln was surely not exceeding his authorization because  his constitutional authority because Congress actually authorized it  although not by formal declaration  in the same way that Congress authorized John Adams, in the same way that Congress authorized Thomas Jefferson. We don't have to just pick the last 50 years. And John Adams is fighting the French. And Jefferson is fighting the Barbary Pirates. And these are not formal, declared wars, but they are congressionally authorized military actions. So, let me  let me just close with Abraham Lincoln  since I invoked Shakespeare. And I told you, he's part of our unwritten constitution. There's a reason he's up there on Mount Rushmore. And you know, he's a very simple, common sensical fellow who says, If you call a tail a leg, how many legs does a dog have? And the answer, ladies and gentlemen, is four. Because calling a tail a leg don't make it so. Okay? And changing the name doesn't mean that this is any different from the very forces that this authorization of the use of military force was essentially about. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you very much. Thank you. So let me say, first of all, I'm not here on an official mission from the European Commission to turn America to this notion of law. It's more the academic pleasure and the opportunity to come to Manhattan and discuss with these great American thinkers. And I will just report to you how this works in Europe and where it comes from. So, first of all, the Right to Be Forgotten, the words, the natural words, they don't tell you the whole story, because actually it is about a deletion right. It is about you exercising control over personal data, you asking big corporations or the state to delete this data which they have about you. Why this is important? It is important because it allows you to control your own life. In the language of the German constitutional court, already from the '70s, this was called informational selfdetermination, and the judges said in a democracy, in a free country, you as an individual must have the right to control what others know about you. You must be able to ask What do you have? and you must be able to ask for deletion, of course within reason. You cannot ask a doctor to delete the medical records, because the doctor must keep them either to show what he has done or she has done in terms of liability. Of course you can't ask the press to delete a bad review if you are a concert pianist, or for that matter if you are someone who has done malpractice or if you are a politician. There are limits to this, which are limits which are important in a democratic society, because that's what you will hear from the other side, that this is an attack on democracy. We see that differently in Europe. We believe democracy needs both. It needs privacy. It needs the ability of the individual to decide himself or herself what the state in particular knows about them, because if you don't have the privacy, how can you organize dissent? How can you organize a new political party, which maybe wants to [unintelligible], if already the government always knows everything about you. So, we need privacy in a free society as we need free speech, and therefore, and now I turn to the recent judgment. First of all, you have to understand this just doesn't fall from the sky like this, but it is application of existing law which we have in Europe since 1995. And it is basically a right to ask a big corporation to delete information about you. Google argued in the case, This doesn't apply to us. We are not what we call in Europe a data controller. Our judges saw that differently. They said sure, you control data about individuals and you profile them. When you put in the name of an individual, Google gives you more than anything else, any other source of information about this person, and our law requires that in the same way that our people can ask data brokers, the bank, you know, they can ask in school after a certain time for things to be deleted, they should be able to ask Google for deletion. Now, the person in question who brought this case from Spain, he had not paid some social contributions and therefore his house had been confiscated and it was a legal obligation in Spain to have a publication in a newspaper of this fact in order to make the auctioning of the house to cover the social contributions better and attractive for the Spanish state, because if it's in the newspaper there will be more people bidding for this house. So, the court said you cannot ask the newspaper to take down the information because they have a legal obligation to publish, but Google you can ask. And this is a principle which also applies when it comes to free speech and democracy. It may well be that Google has to put things  take things down, but it doesn't mean the information disappears. It will stay in the newspaper. It stays on the website of the newspaper of the BBC, of the television station, all this stays around, but Google is subject to the same law of selfcontrol of information, of selfdetermination of individuals, which allows them to ask first what do you have about me and second, please delete. Does it work? Yes, it works well. I just last week met the chief privacy officer of Google. He told me that now they are dealing with these requests in real time. In the beginning there were around 200,000 requests and they had to employ a number of new staff to deal with this, but now it works well. There are practically no complaints which do go to the court. Google has understood the European law of balance between privacy and free speech. The decisions, you know, in the beginning very contested. I think in the meantime everybody says this is working well. And finally, this is something which is important for the future, because more and more data about you will be collected in the digital age, in the internet age, in the age of ever stronger censors, wearables, internet of things and so on. So, when you think tonight about the motion, think about these new censors. Think about the Apple watch. Think about the department store in Manhattan which now follows you on your mobile phone wherever you stand. All this is collected and recorded and there are address dealers and information dealers which have files on you with between 200 and 2,000 parameters, about every person. And these files, they are sold. For example, in a political campaign. Those who have more money, they can buy these files and target you as a voter. If you say, I as an individual want to have control over my data and what's happening to them and I want my children to have control, and I want to have, as a parent, control over what happens to data of my children, then you should vote in favor of the motion: The U.S. Should Adopt the 'Right to Be Forgotten' Online. Last remark: You already have it in some parts of the United States, in some parts of law. For example, in California, there is now a law which gives the possibility for parents to say, and children when they become 18, to wipe out everything until they were 18. In the Fair Credit and Reporting Act about your credit, information which is older than seven years, you can ask to be deleted. So it is already there in part, and the federal trade commissioner, Julie Brill just yesterday said, Wes, this is what we need in America, a right to obscurity. Thank you very much."

    "label": "law",
    "data": "Thank you very much. My mission here tonight is not to persuade you that the internet is perfect the way that it is. My mission is to urge you to vote against the resolution. And unlike Paul, I am of the view that this socalled right to be forgotten in the EU is an epically bad decision, a travesty, an example of great moral and institutional failure on the part of the European Union itself. But my mission here tonight is somewhat more narrow, which is to secure your vote against the motion. As Jonathan alluded to, the emotional underpinnings of this motion, the emotional rationale that lies behind the right to be forgotten is powerful. And it is understandable. There are many people on this planet that have made mistakes in their past, and the internet for them acts as some kind of a permanent record that follows them everywhere. And the fear that it generates is that you will forever be defined by that one mistake that you made, that ended up on the internet or in the press. The problem, though, is the following. And this is what I'm going to try to persuade you of. First, the right to be forgotten is, no matter how you try to construct it, censorship. Censorship has to clear a very high bar in order to be justified in a free and democratic society. The right to be forgotten does not clear that bar. There are vastly better ways to accommodate the emotional rationale for the right to be forgotten. And that doesn't even really get into the implementation dilemmas, all of the different practical reasons why this thing will never, in any meaningful sense, become a right. So that's the outline of the argument that I'm going to make. Let me just begin with a key point, which is the right to be forgotten is censorship. Note the odd passive voice in the construction of the right: The right to be forgotten. We call it a right, but really, it's a duty. And Paul owned up to this very directly in his opening statement. The right to be forgotten is a duty to be able to force other people to forget what they would otherwise remember. That ability, that right to remember is one of the most fundamental rights I think of being a human being. By suppressing true information  and let's be very clear, that is what we're talking about here. We're talking about the suppression of true information, not libel, not defamation, not hate speech. True information intrudes into our collective memory by trying to suppress the documents that constitute that memory. So, we're talking about the regulation of speech and, really, the regulation of thought which is ultimately what memory is. So, this is the right to force people to forget true information. Paul said that this is a  the way he framed it was that this is a right to control your own life, the right to demand deletion. The problem, though, is that I have the right to control what I remember. I have the right to control what I say. I do not have the right to control what you remember. I do not have the right to control what you say. And so for that reason, we must treat the right to be forgotten as it is, which is a form of censorship. So, as I said, censorship in a free and democratic society needs to clear a very high bar to be  to be justified. The right to be forgotten does not meet that bar. First of all, it's way too prone to abuse. It is vague, it is subjective. The language in the European courts' decision is that information should be deleted from searches about the person if it is inadequate, irrelevant or no longer irrelevant or excessive. I challenge you to find a more vague and subjective legal standard anywhere in the law of a free society. It's very clear, by the way, as a practical matter, that this law favors the interests of wellconnected elites in Europe, those who are wealthy, those who are in office, those who would like to suppress embarrassing facts about their lives. And  contrary to Paul's claim that it's working kind of well, you can Google  well, you can Google while you can  any number of articles. The ones that I found were in the English language press in the UK outlining all of the articles that have been suppressed, because Google gives notification to the publisher when an article has been suppressed. And so you will find crimes, you will find criticism, you'll find the case of the piano player who didn't like a 2010 Washington Post unflattering review of a concert that he gave. But there are many, many examples: a lecturer who was suspended got an article about that discipline  disciplinary action suppressed; a man who tried to kill members of his own family was able to have those articles suppressed in searches about his name. And these are from like 2010, 2011. These are not ancient history. So, one other point that I want to make is that the right to be forgotten undermines our moral standing, visa vis dictatorships. In a society with steady rule of law, I suppose it's conceivable that you could have some kind of court mechanism adjudicate the right to be forgotten and come up with a body of case law that would define the bounds of the right, flush it out and so forth. But in most of the world, that's not the case. I guarantee you that the dictators in many parts of the world have a different view about what is relevant and irrelevant about their pasts than we have, and they would gladly use this right to suppress speech and to justify it in their own countries. So, as I said before, there are better ways to accommodate this right. For example, in the American tradition, we believe in not censorship, but more speech. So, for example, if there are links on Google, a better solution might be to say that the subject of the search could add a link, add a comment, or add a symbol that would click you through to whatever you want to say about that link. You might have a right to respond as opposed to a right to censor. Moreover, we've seen that the internet adapts. We've seen the rise of applications like Snapchat, Wuut, WUUT, which are applications that are designed to not be searchable and to facilitate communication without a permanent record being compiled and assembled. In other words, rather than scrubbing information embarrassing to a person, we might even think more broadly about, as a society, how do we treat past mistakes and past errors? Can we learn to broaden and embrace and allow for the selfreinvention that in so many ways defines what it is to be American? That space for personal development and trial and error as you grow up can be accommodated if, as a society, we learn perhaps not to disenfranchise exfelons for the rest of their lives, not to penalize them by making it difficult to get a job and so forth. And so finally, I'll just end on this note, which is that, you know, as George Orwell said, He who controls the past controls the future. Giving any number of individuals a vague standard by which to control their own pasts and thereby try to control their own futures has incredibly negative effects. This right is not necessary. I urge you to vote against the motion."

    "data": "I'd like to ask you to cast your minds back 25 years, 30 years. For those of you who are old enough, or some of the younger people here, I'll just have to tell you what it was like then, when we enjoyed something called privacy. And privacy is a complicated concept, so I want to convey it to you with a few examples. So, imagine a 17yearold boy, he's arrested for selling drugs. A news item appears in the local paper. The police then realize they made a mistake, and they let him go. That's not published in the newspaper. Now, the people around him in his neighborhood may know about this, they may not know about it. They know a lot about this kid. He moves on with his life. It's not a big deal. Second example: A single mom is depressed, she has  her kids  her hands full with her kids. She sees a psychotherapist, she misses some credit card bills, files for bankruptcy. But bankruptcy gives her a fresh start. She gets back on her feet, and she's able to continue with her life. Now, again, her friends and neighbors might know a bit about this, but they also know about her and what she's like and how she is a good mother. So, they know a little bit about what's going on but they still have a relatively complete image of who she is. A third example, a married couple has a terrible divorce. They file for divorce in court. They say terrible things to each other, flinging wild accusations, some of which may contain an element of truth, some of which is exaggerated. They might refer to each other's infidelity. They might allege that the other spouse neglected the children or said bad things about them. Eventually the divorce is settled, and they move on with their lives. So, in all these cases, these events happened. They were public to some extent but at the same time they're private. Not everybody in the world or even outside this area hears about these events. And the law protects them. There are privacy laws  there were privacy laws, they still exist. There are even laws called, expungement statutes, that would have allowed the teenager, for example, to erase his arrest record after a period of time had passed. And although free speech was robust at that time, so were privacy rights. People understood that while other people would have an interest in knowing things about you and talking about you, individuals also have an interest in controlling information about themselves, not necessarily political information, it could just be personal information, things that are embarrassing. Now, I want you to imagine back then in 1990 that an academic  a kooky academic like me or Jonathan came up with the following proposal. We would say, This is a terrible state of affairs that we have, because, after all, if a stranger meets someone  let's say it could be an employer or a creditor or a future romantic partner  it's really in the stranger's interest to be able to know as much about this person as possible. Maybe a future employer would want to know that this kid had been arrested. Even if he wasn't convicted, it's still information that would be useful. So to solve this problem of massive social ignorance, what we should do is record everything that everybody does, put it onto a searchable database, and make this database available to everybody in the world. Okay, so if somebody had made a proposal, even someone like Jonathan, smart guy, or me, not so smart guy, we would have been laughed out of the room, that  What a ridiculous proposal, what a tremendous invasion of people's privacy. But, of course, this is what's happened. It's happened over the last 20 or 30 years, not because of a conscious decision by the public or by the government to implement this crazy recording system, but because of the development of the Internet. Now, what happened? The law has remained the same, but a very important element of privacy back in the '80s and '90s and before then was simply the physical configuration of the environment. It was just very difficult to collect information about people and disseminate it. Okay. That's completely changed. Technology has changed. So the law at the time  the privacy laws at the time could be relatively weak, and yet people's privacy was adequately protected, but now, with this technological change, this old balance between my interest in controlling information about myself and your interest in knowing about me has been upset. And all that the Right to Be Forgotten would do is restore this balance. Okay, so, if we go through these three people again, this kid, 10, 15 years later  let's suppose all of this happened, you know, in the last few years  he applies for a job, the employer puts his name in Google, first thing that comes up is this arrest. Now, the employer might understand that this is not important, but he might. This is the only thing that comes up about this guy. Why not pass him by and hire somebody else? Maybe the single mother's friends, you know, in the '90s they would have gossiped when maybe today they would write about it on Facebook. Maybe she would've written about it on Facebook or on a blog. Now a potential romantic partner, employer, neighbor, colleague puts her name in  maybe she moves to a new city  puts her name in and immediately finds out that she had a mental illness. That's how she's going to be defined to the public. And in the case of the divorced couple, in the old days divorce would be public. It's public information. But it was, you know, put in a file that was stored in the basement of a courthouse. If you wanted to, you could find out about that information, but nobody had any interest at least with respect to ordinary people. Nowadays, you know, their children could type their parents’ names into Google and out comes these allegations. And, of course, not only their children, but future employers, romantic partners, friends, colleagues, anybody in the world, anywhere they go. So, they've lost control over this information about themselves and it's not just that they've lost this control, they've lost the important context. You know, the neighbors, the people in the neighborhood, they know the context of these events. The strangers who do the Google search do not. So, the right to be forgotten would simply restore us, at least partly, to this older period of time. People were happy with the balance between privacy and speech in those days, and I think people would be happy with this balance again if privacy were improved somewhat. So, for that reason you should vote in favor of the motion for the Right to be Forgotten Online in the United States. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you very much, John, and thank you all. I guess I should start with some points of agreement. So, if the question is are there problems with privacy? Yes, there are. And if that were the motion I would hope you would join us in voting for it. If the question were have problems of privacy gotten more difficult over time? We'd vote for that motion, too. I think I'm comfortable saying Andrew would vote for it. If the motion were should everything be recorded at all times and if so, should we do something about that? I would also be in favor, but none of these is the motion. The question is about a right to be forgotten and I want to explain my opening statement that that's a very bad solution to a very real problem. So, let's take an example. Imagine that there was something that I could say right now that would be not felicitous for someone in the world. That's not that hard to imagine. And this debate gets recorded, the podcast goes up, and at some point that aggrieved person files a dispute with Google over the existence of this recording, the web page hosting it. Google will receive that request, that complaint, and it is bound not to tell anybody about it. Google then thinks about it. How does Google think? Companies don't think except with AI. Eventually this will be AI, but not yet. So, they have I assume some interns? Somebody making $10 an hour that is just getting a stream of those 100,000 requests, it's like time to make the donuts, you're like yes, no, no, and Paul's like, you know, they've really learned. They've gotten good at this, and that's because if they don't grant the request, the aggrieved person can appeal in Europe to a data protection authority. I presume there'd be something similar here. That's bad. That's more process. If Google grants the request, that's it. Intelligence Squared wouldn't be informed that their page is no longer findable through the world's most powerful information resource? There'd be no appeal by anyone else. At the moment when it is granted Google notifies the Telegraph, for example, if a story on the Telegraph is taken out of the Google index as a result of this right. The European Union is fighting that notification, because it observes when the Telegraph puts it out, here's what was deleted today, it kind of defeats the purpose of deleting it from Google. It has to be built into this right that we have no idea what we're actually talking about, which is why, oddly enough, as much as Google hates this gift, they're like looking at the box and it's ticking, I'm hoping they don't open it. I'm hoping they continue to fight it, because at some point they may make accommodation with it and when they do it will mean that the one protection we have had, apologies, Andrew, to your former employer, against Google basically running the world is that even Google doesn't know what comes up in Google search results. It's a roulette wheel even to them, but once they cross that bloodbrain barrier and start handtweaking results on request, like a DJ taking in what somebody wants, well, why shouldn't they just do it generally to improve things? And at that point the reality we experience will be one set by this company. And that's what's so strange. If there's going to be something taken out, let a court adjudicate it. Let it do so in camera. That is to say in secret so the fact that it's adjudicating doesn't spill the beans. That should be extremely rare. It should be for corner cases, maybe for cases of the sort that Eric was bringing up. But it cannot be hundreds of thousands of things getting processed because it won't just be AI on Google’s side taking it out, it'll be AI on the complainant's side. I'll write a check to somebody every month, a company that will go ahead, and every time it sees my name in what might not be a good light, it'll automatically file a request on my behalf, and I don't even need to be any the wiser. This starts to be eliminating the middle man so much that it eliminates us from the process of understanding the world. Now, I think I should end, then, by talking a little bit about the ecosystem in which this illconsidered proposal has its best shot at succeeding. And it's today's ecosystem. And basically, it's just Google. I'm like, Bing, how many of you are getting? They’re like, We can't tell you. It's like, You can't tell us because there's so many or because nobody is bothering to take anything out of Bing? Apologies to Microsoft. But if we ended up with Wikisearch  with  do you remember Dogpile? It would do searches of multiple search engines at once. Does each company now have to start fronting a system to start taking stuff down? What if it is Wiki? What if it's a nonprofit? In fact, what if it's a Wiki page of Wikipedia that's taken down, and the page gets changed so the objectionable material is gone, it's been edited out, it's been improved? Who goes back to undelete the hole in the Swiss cheese? The answer is no one. Until these questions can be answered, and maybe they can, back to you guys, I say, please vote against this motion even as you pluck a violin along with us for the very real problems that the for side is rightfully bringing up. We've got to work on this stuff. Maybe court records shouldn't be immediately Google searchable. There should be some frame that keeps that cat a little bit in the bag. We can go case by case and try to come up with categories of information. But if we just stick with a generalized right for, in the words of the decision by the European court of justice, No longer relevant in the view of the complainant, information to be taken out and procedures that must, by their nature, be secret, we will be betraying all of the great things that the information revolution has brought us along with the bad. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Let me start by whisking you back to a magical time  2001. A conservative would have dismissed me as a liberal cliché. I was a floppyhaired, Burning Man regular, San Franciscite who turned down big law salaries to work for social justice. I had worked in refugee camps in Eastern Europe, for an environmental justice mentoring program in D.C., and for the ACLU of Northern California. And most of all, I loved the First Amendment, the quintessential liberal cause  or so I thought. 2001 was also the year I started working at FIRE, which proudly defends speech and academic freedom for speakers of any political stripe. As soon as I started at FIRE, however, I was inundated with hundreds of pleas for help. It wasn't long before I learned this unfortunate truth: if you're going to be censored on the modern college campus for your opinion, chances are you're going to be censored by the Left. And this is what we mean by the Left, and most Americans mean when we say Liberal these days, either people on the left side of the political spectrum or people who selfidentify as liberals, and people to their left. I have been  I have seen so many crazy examples of politically correct censorship. A student at Indiana punished just for publicly reading a book, a sorority sister forced to publicly repent for insensitivity for a Taco Tuesday event, and Yale students banned from calling Harvard students sissies on a tshirt, which was a quote from F. Scott Fitzgerald by the way. This is heartbreaking to me and my teammate, since both of us consider ourselves liberals. Of course there are many, quote, good liberals out there who still support free speech, both on and off campus. These include former ACLU President Nadine Strossen, The Nation's Michelle Goldberg, renowned First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams, and many more. But one thing all of these liberals have in common is that they also believe that the campus liberals have become distressingly intolerant of dissent. Take any hot topic in America today and I can point you to examples of students and faculty members getting in trouble for being on the conservative side of the issue. Take abortion. While FIRE has proudly supported the free speech rights of prochoice students, we are far more likely to have to come to the defense of prolife students. How bad is it? At Northern Kentucky University, a professor actually led her students to destroy a prolife display. The display was only dozens of little white crosses to protest Roe V. Wade. At Dartmouth, a similar prolife display  this time involving tiny American flags, was considered so offensive that another student ran it over with his car. That reckless censor  have you any guess about what his politics were? He had a COEXIST sticker on the back of his car. Or take immigration. At UCLA, a student group faced ferocious protest and a massive fine when they simply attempted to invite someone to come to campus to debate against their proimmigration stance. And though I'm an atheist, I have been horrified by repeated attempts to censor campus evangelicals. Kirsten will tell you more about those cases. Last year, campus liberals made national headlines for demanding that speakers they did not like be disinvited from campuses across the country. This problem has been growing for years. According to extensive research by FIRE, if you're going to face a disinvitation push arising from campus, it's about three times as likely it's going to come from your left. This is especially shocking when you consider how rare it is for a conservative to be invited in the first place. Last year's commencement season saw 25 Democratic political figures speech  speak at the commencements of 60 of America's top universities. And how many Republicans were invited to speak? Zero. And this statistic comes from Nate Silver's decidedly nonconservative FiveThirtyEight website. Some conservatives were invited to talk at universities outside the top 60, including Rutgers. However, even there former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice bowed out after months of pressure from faculty and students. Even mild satire from conservatives isn't tolerated. Take the case of Omar Mahmoud, a Muslim conservative at the University of Michigan. When this past December, he wrote a satirical column poking fun at micro aggressions and privilege theory  very mild. He was not only fired from the student newspaper, but his dorm room door was vandalized. This prompted famous liberal writer Jonathan Chait to criticize the rise of a new wave of political correctness. If Angus and Jeremy concede that there is a problem with free speech on campus, they may blame the massive corporatized modern university. And on this we agree. Much of the censorship does come from outofcontrol administrators. However, we must understand that liberals so thoroughly dominate the current academy, as Kirsten will show, that if they were serious about freedom of speech on campus, this kind of administrative outer  overreach would not be possible despite liberal dominance on campus or maybe because of it. 55 percent of over 400 colleges surveyed last year maintain wildly unconstitutional speech codes while only 4 percent maintain codes that fully meet First Amendment standards. And this in spite of nearly three dozen lawsuits against politically correct speech codes since 1989, successful lawsuits. And we can't forget that the tools that are most often to silence dissent on campus are the brain children of professors, including Katherine McKinnon, Mary Matsuda and Richard Delgado, all of whom were liberal leaders of the speech code movement in the 1980s. Though it gives me no joy to say it, you must vote in favor of the motion, yes, liberals do stifle intellectual diversity on campus. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. The picture that Greg drew is a common one. It is the conservative picture of the modern university. Perhaps best summarized by former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum who called universities indoctrination mills. In this picture, we are  higher education is infused with an overly liberal professoriate, biased classrooms and stifled campus debate. If this picture is true, it is indeed very serious. If it is an accurate portrait of higher education in America, then we should all be alarmed, and we should all donate money to Greg's group. Is it, though? I will handle those first two, are professors liberal? And why? Is the classroom a biased place? And mostly leave the third to Angus. So, are professors liberal? Well, yes. When we did the research, a national random sample survey for our book, we found that 61 percent of college professors are left or liberal. But this is nothing new. The very first time we looked at college professors in a structured survey in 1933, we found almost the same number. So, it isn't like the '60s: radicals all went into faculty positions and moved young minds to the left. So, why  what explains this? Well, the conservative explanation for the overwhelming liberal campus is simple: Conservatives are squeezed out of grad school, convinced that their ideas aren't worthy of a PhD. And those few that escape this thought police then find it very hard to get a job because liberals discriminate and won’t hire conservatives. And then those few conservatives that get through this gauntlet are denied tenure by bitter liberal colleagues. This simply is not so. When we surveyed faculty members, 85 percent argued that ideology played no role in tenure in their department. And this was true of 87 percent of conservatives we surveyed, so  of the very conservative. So, it is not the case that conservatives need not apply for jobs. Why aren't there more conservative professors to fight the good fight? Well, the first answer I’d give you is money. If you are someone who believes in the market uber alles, you might want to make more than $29.5k, which is what I made my first year as a young college professor in 1996. If you work four years for a PhD like I did, you might think you deserve something better. That's what we got. So, I think the market keeps conservatives from wanting to be in the academy. I also think there's a pocketbook issue here. Professors depend on two sources of government for their income. One is those many professors like myself who work for state government. If conservatives win, you may not get a raise for four years. And a lot of professors also work on federal grants. The Republican party is not the Republican party of 1955, which was very supportive of higher education. It is a party that is devoted to cutting government spending. We aren't surprised when oil executives vote Republican. It's in their economic interest. The same is true for college professors. We also have seen the conservative movement have a hostility to science which it didn't have 40 years ago. So, in our survey, we found, contrary to earlier ones, that natural science professors were moving to the left. Well, if a party attacks evolution, you're going to lose a lot of natural and social scientists because we happen to believe in the scientific method. It's good politics for Republicans. I give them that. There's a lot more people who think the world was created in seven days than people with PhDs. So it's a good move, but it hurts them on college campuses. There's also another thing that we found is conservatives on college campuses are pretty much like other professors. They're also very, very pro gay rights. While one party has embraced that social movement, the other party is fairly fervently against it. So, that is again moving professors away from any tendencies to be Republican or conservative. Finally, an antiintellectualism is occupying certain wings of the Republican party. It used to be that that was more the Democrats that were anti intellectual. Anyone remember George Curly Wallace? When George Wallace ran for president as an Independent after being a Democrat, he almost got no faculties’ support  in '68. The inheritors of the Wallace movement today are in the Republican party. It is that kind of antiintellectualism that turns off college professors. So, I don't think that college professors are becoming liberal out of a viewpoint discrimination. Is the classroom biased against conservatives? I would argue no, that if you ask students, do you feel that your viewpoints aren't welcome on your college campus? In survey after survey, the majority of students say no. So, I think this portrait of an overly liberal campus can be discredited with Greg's own research, that in his work where he identified the 12 worst campuses in 2013, and he said, These are examples of liberal viewpoint discrimination, conservatives being squelched. Well, in fact, of the 12, three were nonpolitical, entirely conservative, small c conservative administrators just saying, Oh, I don't want people talking about sex on my campus. We might lose donations. Three of them were conservatives squelching liberals. And finally, there were four of the classic where liberals were being  were squelching conservatives. There is a place in this very city where I would not be allowed to speak on any topic at all. It's Catholic University. Catholic University, like many conservative campuses, is very explicit about not allowing liberals to speak. I'm not exactly a liberal, but I am pro choice. Catholic University has an official policy: No one who has ever publicly advocated for the right to abortion is allowed to speak."

    "data": "Thank you. Thanks to Intelligence Squared for doing a debate on such an important topic. And I'm always happy to be anywhere where Bill O'Reilly can't interrupt me, so I'm happy to be here. Our opponents are telling you that liberals are not stifling intellectual diversity on campuses. Sadly, this could not be further from the truth. A perfect example of this is a 2013 case that happened at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, where I'm from. My parents were professors there. A feminist professor filed multiple sexual harassment complaints against the student university  the campus university there  because of an April Fool’s Day issue of an article that was mildly mocking feminism. The professor filed another complaint after the newspaper published an article that was critical of hate speech. The university's repeated investigations dragged on for almost nine months and  and it only really ended when FIRE had intervened and informed them they were violating the First Amendment. Ironically, the editorinchief, who wrote this article, was herself a feminist and thought she was doing a very mild, mocking, April Fool’s Day story. And she told FIRE that the chilling investigation that was launched by the University of Alaska prevented her from publishing stories on important issues, including sexual assault. Recently, at Milwaukee's Marquette University, a political science professor there, John McAdams, blogged about an exchange where a Marquette philosophy professor had told a student that debating gay marriage in class was, quote, not appropriate and homophobic. For this, Marquette suspended the professor, McAdams, who blogged about it, banned him from campus, and they are now in the process of trying to revoke his tenure. Greg and I both support gay marriage, but this is an extremely chilling way for Marquette to handle this issue. As Jeremy acknowledged, the decks are stacked against those who express nonliberal views on campuses. And I would just point out, to the point that campuses have always been liberal, liberals are very  liberals  the liberals in the past actually supported free speech, and I think that would be the big difference of today, is that the liberals that we're talking about today are enacting very hostile policies against free speech. And so there's a big difference. They may be voting for the same people, but they are behaving in a very different way. And many studies will back up the fact that there are vastly more liberals on campuses. There was one study that found that 72 percent of college professors identify as liberal, while only 15 percent identify as conservative. It's gotten so bad that several prominent social psychologists have written an article recently arguing that the field of psychology is being badly hurt by the lack of political diversity. One of the papers  and, by the way, none of them are conservatives who wrote this  one of the paper's authors is NYU Professor Jonathan Haidt. At a 2011 social psychologist symposium, he asked the audience to show hands for their political leanings. Out of a thousand people only three raised their hands to say that they were conservative. And Haidt points out that, of course, there were more conservatives in the audience  that can't be the actual ratio  but they were too afraid to identify themselves, which speaks for itself. He explained that this gross political and ideological disparity is evidence of a, quote, tribal moral community that actively discourages conservatives from entering. He explained that there were  in preparing for his speech, he wanted to talk to some nonliberal graduate students. He was able to only identify two in the  of social psychology graduate students, and that he said that he  they reminded him of closeted gays from the 1980s. And he referred to them as closeted conservatives because they were  they felt that they were forced to hide their identities and  from their colleagues and from their professors, and it really affected the research that they did. And so Haidt argued that more ideological diversity would lead to, quote, better science and freer thinking. The ideological slant, it's not just a passive preference. During the 2012 election, 96 percent, which is almost 100 percent as we all know, of political contributions from Ivy League faculty and staff went to the Obama campaign. And during the 2004 election, professors donated $19 to John Kerry's campaign for every dollar that went to George Bush. And as sociologist Neil Gross has pointed out, our colleges and our universities are one party campuses. Last year at the University of California at Santa Barbara, one of the worst cases probably that we'll talk about tonight, a feminist professor's study  she was found guilty of grand theft, vandalism, and battery after a physical altercation in which she stole and destroyed a 16yearold prolife demonstrator's sign. The professor claimed she was triggered by the poster's graphic images, called the demonstrators terrorists, and told police she had a moral right to her behavior and was just setting a good example. She still has a job and was basically defended by scores of professors. We've also seen discrimination against Christian groups on campuses – it’s getting much worse at Vanderbilt. Fourteen campus groups lost their organizational status in 2012 because they wanted to choose their own leaders based on religious belief. And there are just many more campus fellowship groups from University of  State University of New York or the Cal State system who've lost  have been driven off campus. And, you know, Harvard Professor and former Obama administration appointee Cass Sunstein has warned that when a group becomes ideologically homogenous, it tends to drift farther and farther in that direction and become more hostile to outsiders."

    "data": "Thank you. My adversaries have made some really cogent points this evening, and so as an actual campus Leftist, I look forward to denouncing them as bigots. But before I do that, I'd like to take a step back and talk a little bit about the campus. What the actual, average American campus is like today. The American campus today, as it has been in the past, is a site of robust and passionate debate. And that's true not only because it's a place of learning, but also because it is a haven for young people. And the reality is that most of us, at some point in our lives, give up on debating people we profoundly disagree with. We decide that it's too hard, it's too uncomfortable, it doesn't usually work. And so, we give up. But college students haven't given up yet. And so, they argue, incessantly and angrily. But here's the thing. In my experience, on campuses across the country  and this is backed up by my opponent's own data  where free speech is curtailed on campus, it's overwhelmingly not by students or campus liberals, but by administrators who are motivated not by ideology, but by opposition to disruptiveness and clamor. A perfect example of this is a case that many critics of campus leftism and campus liberalism have talked about  the case of Robert Birgeneau, the former chancellor of the University of California Berkeley, who, as Berkeley chancellor, presided over the arrests of dozens of peaceful, nonviolent student protestors on multiple occasions, including one occasion in 2011, where students who were demonstrating peacefully were beaten viciously by campus police with batons. After he stepped down as Berkeley's chancellor, Birgeneau was invited to give a commencement address at Haverford College in Pennsylvania. And some Haverford students were understandably not so happy about this. So, what did they do? Did they burn down the building? Did they lock him out? Did they beat him with batons? No. They did none of those things. What they did is write a letter. They wrote a long letter expressing their concerns in which they offered suggestions for how he could repair the harm that he had done to civil liberties at Berkley. And they urged  that was their word  urged him  to  as they put it, confront the issues before you. If he didn't do that, they said, they would ask the college to withdraw his invitation, a request that they had no power to enforce. In a twoline reply, Birgeneau said that he would not respond to what he called their violent verbal attacks. Period. He wouldn't meet with them. He wouldn't respond to the claims that they had made. He wouldn't debate them. And in fact, he wouldn't even come to their campus. He withdrew his decision to come and speak at their commencement. Now, FIRE has written about this incident many times. Oped writers all over the country have written about this incident. And every time they do, Birgeneau  an administrator who presided over the beating and arrest of student protestors  is portrayed as a free speech martyr. Well, the students who had just wanted to talk to him about that  are portrayed as his oppressors. And I say that that is absolutely wrong. I say that is absolutely backwards. Now, I'm not asking you to embrace every argument made by every member of the campus Left, because frankly, some of their arguments are really bad arguments. But speech that nobody opposes is not speech that needs protecting. And there's a recurring tactic that we see in critics of the campus Left in which students who are engaging in free speech are condemned as violent or condemned as censors. And you know, hyperbole is free speech, whether it's the hyperbole of students calling a speaker who said something unfortunate a racist or the hyperbole of an administrator calling a polite letter a violent attack. Demonizing your opponents is free speech. But so is refusing to demonize them. And that's what I'm asking you to do today. I want you to vote against this motion, because it's not liberals who are stifling free speech on the American campus, but bureaucrats. Bureaucrats who are scared by the rowdy, messy vitality of the marketplace of ideals  ideas. So, what I'm asking you to do here is to stand up for free speech on campus  the freedom of speech of the Left and the Right and the Center by voting against this illconceived and prejudicial motion. And I'd just like to close by saying one thing. A few days ago we lost a champion of speech and debate and dialogue in this country, David Carr, who wrote for the New York Times. And on the stage at the Intelligence Squared debates a couple years ago, he said something that I would just like to quote to you now. He said, I urge you to vote against, against, against this motion which is per se dumb. Thank you."

    "data": "America as a hasbeen is the oldest story in the book. Even right after the Revolution, the famous American  French statesman Talleyrand dumped on the United States by saying it's a country with 30 religions and just one dish to eat. Little did he know that a bit later, like today, that one dish would blanket the world with 35,000 McDonalds. Decline is not a real serious diagnosis. It's repertoire theater. Today, we are in decline 5.0. We've had four before. And various candidates  Russia, Europe, Japan  were about to overtake the United States, leave the United States in the dust, and now it is the Soviet  it is China. These prophecies did not pan out because they confused the headlines with the longterm trend. Exhibit A for every declinist is the economy, where others are always said to be growing faster. But here's the surprise. For the last 50 years, the U.S. share of the global GDP has held steady, around 25, 26 percent. In the same period, the E.U. lost 11 points, Japan more than two. And Russia has cut its share in half. So, who's declining, if I may ask? Let's put it this way. If Rome, starting some 2000 years ago, had been declining at America's rate, we would be debating in Latin today. Now, a certain measure of power is military spending. The U.S. is in a league of its own. It spends almost four times more than China, seven times more than Russia, 12 times more than Japan. It spends as much as the next nine countries together, five of whom, by the way, are allies. What does all this cash buy? The short answer is that the U.S. navy is as large as the next 12 navies together. In its heyday, Britain only wanted to be twice as strong as the next one. So, only the United States can intervene anywhere in the world, nobody else can. Like those B2 stealth bombers that took off in Missouri, dropped a load on Libya, and returned home in one trip. Now, that's a snapshot, our opponents will say  will say. The others will inevitably overtake the United States, because they're growing  they're rising. Do you mean Russia, with an economy that's onetenth the size of America? Or China, which has a per capita oneeighth of America? China  China, you will say, Look, they came from nowhere. They're now number 2. But the days of China's spectacular growth are over. It's one half of what it once was. And this is no accident  the Chinese growth model is like Japan's, and Taiwan's, and South Korea  all of them have come down. The  and so, there is something inherently wrong with this model. We'll talk about it later. So, the  the  they would say, But what about the Chinese labor force? Well, the Chinese advantage is gone, too. Productivity has not kept up with the explosion of wages. In manufacturing, the wage gap with the U.S. has almost disappeared. And worse, this year, the Chinese labor supply will begin to shrink due to rapid aging. The U.S., on the other hand, will be the youngest nation in the industrialized world. Let's think about future. What drives growth in the future? Well, factor number one is higher education. Did you know that of the top 20 universities, 17 are American? The first Chinese university shows up in the 100 to 150 bracket. You look at  you look at citations in scientific journals. You look at patents. The gap between the U.S. and China is just as wide as the Pacific. So and but the greatest  the greatest American advantage is the power of immigration. China and Russia, closed societies, don't even think about immigration. But here, as you know, from the very beginning the tide continues to flow in. Why do I harp on immigration? Because it keeps the country not only young but also from freezing up. Immigration breaks privilege and fuels competition. There's always another group that pushes in, works harder, and rises to the top. The newcomers keep bringing ambition and skill as they have done for the  for 300 years. Try to become a Chinese. I want to become a Chinese. It's easy to become an American. Here, I'll tell you how to do it. I celebrate 4th of July and Thanksgiving. I joined the PTA and coach Little League. I stopped smoking. I buy an SUV and shop till I drop. The serious point is anybody can sign up to the American creed. And, Where did you go to school? beats, Where do you come from? any time. As a Chechnyan you'll never become a real Russian, but Sergey Brin could come here from Russia and start Google. Did you know that one half of Silicon Valley's engineers were born abroad? Twofifths of all startups in the Valley built two years ago were founded by immigrants, Vladivostok or Kyoto or even Madrid. Immigration is the inexhaustible source of rejuvenation, bringing in the world's best and brightest. That's the moral of this tale. Let me ask  end with a surprise confession. I actually like this American obsession with decline. It’s part of the country's religion of selfimprovement  an offshoot of the prophetic tradition. Isaiah: Beware of sloth, pride. Look at your own flaws, and keep on hustling. Declinism is the best antidote to decline. But declinism is repertoire theater, like a good scare, like another sequel to Nightmare on Elm Street. Where are Soviet Russia, Europe, Japan today? Where is 15 percent growth of China? The truth is, only one nation can do an America, and that is America itself. And that's why I like this declinist agitation. It will make sure it won't happen. So, to repeat from  I've been going downhill at the American rate, we would be debating in Latin today, like Gratias [unintelligible], which means, Thank you, and see you in the next round."

    "data": "Thank you very much, John. It's great to be here tonight. As John said, I'm an MP. I debate in a Westminsterstyle parliament. So, I am used to all sorts of rhetorical dirty tricks from the honorable members, the opposite side of the aisle. And I wanted to start by warning you about what I thought were going to be the fiendish rhetorical moves tried out by the other guys. So, here are the three things I want you to beware of and not to be misled by. The first one is  and it's the tough thing about debating our side of this question  that in voting for our side, which is the correct one, you are going to be accused of being insufficiently patriotic. And efforts are going to be made to impugn your love of the United States. Don't fall for that one. The highest form of patriotism is to see clearly what's happening in your country. The second one, which I'm sad to say we've already heard a lot from in Joe's beautiful, eloquent presentation, is what I call the cleanest dirty shirt argument. And this is the defense of the United States which basically says, Okay, we may have our problems, but everybody else is worse. Look at those Europeans. Look at those Japanese. Look at those Russians. Look at those Chinese. We're not debating here, Is the U.S. in less trouble than the world's other countries? We're debating, Is the U.S. in decline, relative to where it has been? And you know what? You guys have a responsibility to be super good. You are the last remaining superpower. We need you to be morally, intellectually, and, in terms of world authority, better than everybody else. So, just to be a little bit less bad, that's not good enough. So, why do we believe  and we say this with real sadness  why do we fear that America is in decline? The first evidence is what's happening internationally. In the Cold War era and then following the collapse of the Soviet Union, we lived in a time of what you might call the Pax Americana. And as a Canadian it was a great time. It wasn't just a great time for America. It was a great time for the world. Unfortunately, we're seeing America pulling back. We're seeing that on big issues like climate change, a huge  there's lots of kids here. We need to be fixing this for you guys. Where's American global leadership on this issue? We're seeing in a place like Syria, there was a red line, the red line was crossed, what happened? And we're seeing it most acutely  and this is something I'm just so terrified about  in Russia and Ukraine. Joe pointed out, and he is quite right, the Russian economy is onetenth the size of the U.S. economy. So, how come Putin is getting away with redrawing the borders of Europe and no one, least of all the United States  the U.S. isn't even at the Minsk peace talks right now. Is that not a superpower in decline? And this is bad news for the whole world because superpowers, as Bob Kagan wrote very brilliantly, are not allowed to retire. Second argument is your political gridlock. And here I think we would all agree that the genius of America is the ingenuity of the American people. It's what each individual person does, and that is fantastic. But I think we would all also agree there's a role from time to time for government to do a few things. Joe talked movingly, and I totally agree with him, about immigration being such a strength in America. You guys have a few problems to sort out with that, and you're going to need government to act, and I don't see government acting. Now, you may say, It was ever thus. Washington has always been a mess. I'm a politician. I know what people say about politicians. But Sarah Binder of Brookings did a study last year, and she found that the likelihood of Congressional gridlock on a given issue has doubled over the past 65 years. Your government is ineffective at a time when you need effective government for yourselves and for the world. Finally, and this to me is the biggest problem, this is the thing that really keeps me up at night, democratic capitalism, that great U.S. model, isn't working the way it used to and the way it is supposed to. For the past 30 years, the U.S. middle class has been hammered. Wages have stagnated, and wealth has stagnated or declined, while the people at the very top have seen their incomes and wealth skyrocket. That is a huge problem for the United States because the U.S. promise, as Joe so eloquently said, is If you work hard and play by the rules, you can succeed. But that is not what the U.S. economy today is delivering, and that's why gridlock is such a problem because it is going to take a massive, united social effort and really inspired, brilliant leadership to resolve this economic conundrum, which I believe is a challenge comparable to the challenge presented by the industrial revolution. Now, you may say to me, Well, but isn't this a problem that all the Western industrialized economies face to some degree or another? And I would agree with you. It's a thing we're worried about in Canada, too. But this income inequality is worse in the U.S. than in any other Western industrialized country. Your elites are doing better, and your middle class is more hammered. Did you know that working men, so men between 20 and 50, the employment rate of men in that group in the U.S. is lower than in France? That's a problem. I want to conclude with a quote. This is from Thomas Jefferson. He wrote, We have no paupers. The great mass of our population is of laborers. Our rich, who can live without labor, either manual or professional, being few and of moderate wealth. Most of the laboring classes possess property, cultivate their own lands, have families, and from the demand for their labor are entitled to exact from the rich and the competent such prices as enable them to be fed abundantly, clothed, and to raise their families."

    "data": "I considered declining this invitation when it was made. NPR intellectual is not really my crowd. I live in Texas. But then I realized that the word damn was in the proposition so I'd be allowed to swear. On NPR. A lot. So, here I am. But enough about my hopes and dreams. Let's talk about you. Where are my boomers? People born 1946 to 1964. Come on. Hands up, yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys are a freakin' army. You're the largest generation we've ever had. Oh, it's like a third of the total, but we've got a lot of youngsters up top. So, you know, it's a swarm. Most of your consumption, however, is behind you. Your kids have left home. The house is paid for. You're at the height of your taxpaying experience, which means that the government's like, I'll take some of that, and then I'll take some more. Today's budget battles, that's the start of our debate about figuring out not how to pay things with your money, but about how to pay your retirement without your money. Something to look forward to. Which sucks for this next group. Where are my GenY? Or excuse me, GenX. GenX. Oh, we're all here. Yeah, we're the smallest generation as a percentage of the population. So very soon it will be up to us, all 11 of us, to pay for 75 million retiring boomers. Taxes are going to be awful, but it's not quite as bad as it seems. Because while the boomers are so convinced that they're so special, there's actually a boomer class globally that relative to the population is about 20 percent larger than it is here. So, yes we do have a boomer donculous [spelled phonetically] tax bill just around the corner, but it's actually considerably less than what everyone else is going to have to pay. So, you know, not exactly hope, but you know, schadenfreude. And then there's GenY. GenY folks, you know, the millennials. Oh, a few of you showed up tonight. That's great. Your age group does the consuming. Kids, houses, cars, pot. It's  spend, spend, spend. Your purchases, especially the pot, by the way, are why the economy is doing so well right now. Because of you, because of your bulk, the United States is going to be the youngest developing  excuse me, developed country in the world in just four years, younger than China. And in 15 years when you have matured, and I use that term in the loosest possible way  you will swarm into the taxpaying class with a fervor that Gen X just could've never matched. And Gen X will be settling into the tardislike space that the boomers will be vacating and America's 20year effort to digest the boomer demography will finally be over. Now, as an Xer it really pains me to say this, but you GenYers are special. Because there are no German Y's or Japanese Y's or Italian or Canadian Y's. It's as if the entire developed world forgot how to have kids around 1975 and I think we've all traveled enough to know they got the basics down. This combination of bigger global Boomer cadre, but no global Y cadre spells disaster. Consumer activity and tax income will shrink every single year. Retiree costs will increase every single year. It's a deflationary spiral with no escape and it will happen everywhere but the United States. And that's the good news. Let's talk about the bad news. Let's talk about trade. The idea that you can trade with a country a quarter, a third, halfway around the world, that's a very strange idea. Until recently, major countries used their navies to protect trade between their colonies and their mainland. You didn't trade with your neighbor if you could avoid it, because you never knew when someone might throw a war, and you lose access to everything. These separate imperial systems clashed, and those clashes culminated in World War II. Now, at the end of that war, the United States forced all of its allies to sit down, and we imposed a new economic system upon the world. We called it free trade. We told them they didn't need navies. We would patrol the global oceans and allow them to send whatever they wanted anywhere to anyone at anytime. In addition, we would open our market  the only consumer market survived the war  so, they could export their ways back to affluence. In exchange, there was one demand. This alliance would fight the Cold War our way. You heard that right. We bribed up an alliance to take on the Soviets. And it worked. Free trade created the free world. Europe united. Japan rebuilt. China modernized. The global population tripled. Global GDP increased by a factor of 10. Onethird of the Chinese and Italian GDP  exportdriven. The EU? The Chinese Communist Party? All of that would have been impossible without the safe and reliable access to the global oceans and the U.S. market. Which leads us to the world's most inconvenient truth  the United States didn't create free trade as an economic plan, but as a strategic gambit. We don't use free trade's economic features. Our exports  9 percent of GDP, the lowest in the world by a significant margin. We are the least integrated country out there. America's economy, and future, are not dependent upon the global system. It's the global system that is predicated upon America's willingness to sublimate its market and its military in order to fight a war that ended a generation ago. That is not a safe bet. I mean, really, have you met Americans? We kind of shoot from the hip. The world is now dependent upon our mood. And even should we stick to our Prozac regimen, the majority of the world's Boomers will still retire around 2020, which just as surely will trigger a Great Depression, if we're lucky. There are many other reasons, similarly inevitable, why the U.S. will remain the global superpower well beyond our lifetimes. The shale revolution has pushed North America within 2 million barrels per day of outright oil independence. And we now have the lowest electricity prices, non subsidized  in the world. The U.S. is home to nearly half of global consumer spending, double that of the combined BRICs. The Navy has a 10:1 ratio, conservatively, in terms of global firepower. And the commitment of that imbalance to the global commons is why trade works. And the dollar is the sole denomination for every commodity in every country, especially for those exportdriven rivals who are utterly dependent upon free seas and open markets. So, when you think of the U.S., it doesn't matter if you feel a swelling pride, a loathing, or a resigned sigh. Your conclusion is as singular as it is clear. Bet on America. Declinists be damned."

    "data": "Thank you, John. I want to begin with a simple declarative statement, which is, I love America. I pray for her. And I wish her well. And it's precisely for that reason that I'm here arguing this side, because when you love your country and you see it in decline, when you see a disaster coming, as you do, you really just stand up and say that. And I appreciate the opportunity to talk about that tonight. The second thing I want to say is that almost everything  practically everything our opponents said is correct, but I would suggest irrelevant. Joe was exactly right. No one knows more about the diplomatic history of the last 50 years. But if you had been an observer at the Battle of Hastings in the morning, you would have said the English had the advantage. They had more troops and higher ground. If you had looked at the battlefield at noon, the English were still winning because they withstood a barrage of arrows from William the Conqueror. If you looked at the battlefield about 3:00, the English were still winning because their lines had held. They only had to wait until sundown. It wasn't until shortly before sundown, at the end of the day, in a desperate move, that William the Conqueror pulled out some new tactics. The English lines broke, and the course of history was changed forever. My point is, take no comfort from the fact that prior prognostications have not played out, because I think  I'll explain in a minute why we're in a much more dangerous zone. Joe talked about  described a declinist view involving rhetoric, agitation, and religion. What I'd like to do is  there's nothing – I have no problem with rhetoric and religion, but let's talk about science for a minute. The most important question in economics and geopolitics today is Are capital markets and is our society a complex system? If it's not, then maybe our opponents win. But if it is, we have serious problems ahead of us. What do I mean by a complex system? A lot of people think, you know, your watch might be complex. It's  the technical name, It's complicated, it's not complex. The complex system has the following characteristics. It has diversity, lots of points of view. It has interconnectedness so that those different points of view are in touch with each other. It has communication, so you're communicating, you're transacting, you're interacting with each other. And finally it has adaptability, which is other people's behavior affects your behavior. So, those are the four defining characteristics of a complex system. There is no question, capital markets, finance is not only a complex system, it is the complex system, nonpareil. And this  again, this is physics, but it applies very carefully, very closely to these economic systems. So, let's just take  let's just do a thought experiment. We'll use the  use the audience. We'll use all of you. There are about 500 people in the room. Let's say that right now a third of you got up, screamed, and ran out the door as fast as you could. What would the rest of you do? I daresay you'd be right behind them. You wouldn't know what was up. You would say, Well, they know something I don't. The place is on fire. There's a bomb scare. I'm not going to stay around to find out. I'm right behind them. Let's say a third of you were particularly nervous. You're more nervous than the rest. For you, it would only take 20 people jumping up, screaming, running out the door, and you would be right behind them. Now, let's say there are 20 of us who are the most nervous of all, very, very  very, very much on edge, and for you it would only take five people standing up, screaming, and running out the door, and you would right  you would be right behind them. How many people do I have to persuade to empty the whole place, to cause a panic, to cause this whole place to run out the door? The answer is five people, because if five people run, 20 more will run. If 20 run, a third run, and if a third run, the whole audience runs. I like to say when it comes to the collapse of the dollar, Paul Krugman will be the last guy to leave the room, but that's his problem. But the point is, what I just described, there's a technical name for it, hypersynchronous ising model, but the point is that's a cascade. That's how complex systems operate. It takes very small changes in initial conditions to completely, catastrophically change the outcome. What kind of complex system do we have right now? We have got more debt than we had in 2008. You all remember 2008, too big to fail? Well, the biggest banks in 2008 are bigger today. They have a larger concentration of their total financial assets. Derivatives books are bigger. In a complex system, when you increase the scale, and that's what I'm talking about, the risk goes up exponentially. So, let's say I increase the derivatives books  I triple the derivatives books at the major banks, how much did the risk go up? Well, if you ask Jamie Dimon, he would say, You know, very little because, you know, it's long, short, long, short. It all pairs off. You net it down, it’s a tiny little amount. If you ask my 84year old mom, she might use intuition and say, Well, if you triple the system, maybe you triple the risk. The correct answer in a complex system, it's exponential function. If you triple the scale of the system, you've increased the risk by a factor of 100 or 1,000. You've made it much more dangerous, and I just showed you how it takes a very small change in the initial conditions to cause the entire thing to collapse. So, that's the system we're living in now. We're right on the knifeedge. Very small preservations, very small changes could cause a catastrophic financial collapse. And I'm not talking about the kind of long, slow, gradual decline that Joe is expert on. And, you know, Peter, no one knows more about this sort of geography of geopolitics than Peter. But what are we talking about in the world today? We're not talking about an amphibious invasion on the beaches of New Jersey or Long Island. Peter's analysis might have been certainly pertinent in 1860, probably as late as 1960. Admiral Rogers, who's the head of the United States cyber command, said the next war will be in cyberspace. And my only quibble with Admiral Rogers is that, that war has already begun. We're in a  we're in a cyber war with Russia right now. In 2010, it was disclosed that Russian intelligence had penetrated the NASDAQ market operating system with an attack virus. These are not hackers trying to get your credit card numbers. This is  this is the military intelligence unit getting in the operating system of our second largest stock market. In August 2013 NASDAQ was closed for half a day. We've never been offered a explanation as to what happened there. I want to suggest if the explanation was an attack, there would be good reason not to tell us because it would panic investors, start those people running out of the theater exactly as I described. So, this is the situation we're living in today. One last point, what's the R&D budget for fire? How much did it cost to invent fire? The answer is, Zero. The R&D budget was  somebody had a bright idea someday, maybe they saw some lightning, who knows what, but they invent a fire. What's the payoff to humanity from the invention of fire? Incalculable. What was the R&D budget for the Boeing 787, the Dreamliner? It's $32 billion. What was the improvement? Well, I've flown on a 787. I can't tell the difference. It looks like a 767 or a 777. The point is this is characteristics of complex systems. You get to a point where you have larger and larger inputs for no pay off. Fire was free, huge benefit. Boeing spent $32 billion on a new airline, very hard to see if there's any benefit at all. How are we paying for this? We're printing the money. We're using derivatives. We're creating a dynamically unstable system. It would take very little to cause it to collapse almost overnight. Thank you."

    "data": "Amazon is the reader's friend. In the longterm obviously readers are only going to thrive in a world where author's also thrive and I suspect we're going to spend a lot of time eventually talking about the impact, the longrun impact of Amazon on authors and authorship. And my partner is going to be able to speak to a lot of that in a great deal of detail, more depth than I possibly can. But I write about economics. I'm a pretty literal person. So, I’m going to keep it a little bit on the surface level  Amazon is the Reader's Friend. And I think you can see that Amazon is the reader's friend, by just asking, why are we debating this at all? Why is this a subject of controversy? It's a subject of controversy because Amazon is really big. It's a big company. It's a powerful company. They have 41 percent of all books sold  I saw a statistic from last March  and 67 percent of all digital books. That's big. That's a big power player. It's worth talking about. And it naturally raises the question, you know, how did the company get so big. How did they have so much market share? Why are they so dominant? My argument is, they're so dominant in this space because they're the reader's friend. Who buys books? It's readers. Amazon sells books to the vast majority of readers because it's good for readers. Another argument  you know, Frank has written that Amazon is some kind of a monopoly, some kind of an abusive force that's dominating the marketplace, maybe through nefarious means, something like that. Some strategy other than being a reader's friend. And I think that that's just not true, this idea that Amazon must be stopped by some kind of external force. It doesn't hold up, because the fact of the matter is even though Amazon has an extremely large share of the market, it faces a ton of competition. I don't know about you guys, but I'm the owner of an iPhone. I bet a lot of people in the audience may be  may be iPhone users. Yes? No? Yes. Yes? Maybe  maybe some of you have a Google, an Android phone, something like that, yeah? Yeah. So, some people have Smartphones. It turns out these phones, they're directed  they're connected directly to digital stores. You can go on iBooks on your iPhone. You can go to the Google Play store on your Android. And you can find How Soccer Explains the World. You can find  Frank edited a book called Jewish Jocks that I've been meaning to check out since I was in a debate in San Francisco with his co editor. And I actually  I picked it up on my phone on the train. You can find  I'm not sure if it's every Scott Turow novel, but a great deal of them. They're there in the Google store. They're there in the Apple store. These are companies that are competing with Amazon. And they're not, like  these are not small, weak, pathetic, helpless companies, right? They're actually bigger than Amazon. Amazon is not going to drive Apple out of business. They're not going to drive Google out of business. What they are doing is beating them badly in the electronic book space. They're selling way more books than those companies. So, how is it that they're doing that? Did they do something sneaky? No. They have a better product, right? You can get Apple, Google on your phone. You get them on your tablet. But it's Amazon who invested in creating the Kindle, which is a digital device that's really meant for reading, you know? I like to read books sometimes on my iPad. It's fun. But my wife, she's got a Kindle Paperwhite, and she loves it. And I've been known to borrow it, because it  it really is a better device for reading books on than what these other companies do. They've also got a superior piece of software. If you download a Kindle book, you can read it on your Kindle, but you can also use the Kindle app on an iPhone, on an Android tablet. You can read it on the Web. Apple and Google, they both want to make more exclusive, more lockeddown platforms that don't give you as much flexibility. And that's fine. Different companies have different strategies. But normally, in a market, if you were going to offer an inferior product, you would try to beat your competitors on price. But Apple and Google don't do that either. In fact, Apple tried to team up with book publishers to make prices higher. So, it becomes pretty natural, you know? Amazon has this market share because they have a better product, a better product than their digital competitors. And if you compare it to their brick and mortar competitors, you know, there's no  there's no competition. It's cheaper to get digital books. It's much more convenient to get digital books. It's much more flexible. You can take them along when you're traveling. And Amazon also has a store where if you're looking for something  you know, you put it in there. And if it doesn't exist in a digital form, you can order the paper book, right? That's really neat. It's a good convenience, because when there's something you want to read, you know, you really want to get the text that you want. You don't care as much about the format. The other digital companies don't do that. All of which is you know, it's a long way of getting to the point, but it's to say that Amazon has won its market share the best possible way to win market share. It's by doing a better job, offering a better service at a better price. Long story short, they're the reader's friend, you know? So, we're debating this in New York City. New York is a great city. I know New York very well. I grew up here. I grew up on 12th Street and University Place, down in the Village. And I remember, when I was a kid, right in the neighborhood, you know, you could go to Broadway. There was a Shakespeare and Company down maybe on 4th Street. There was a Forbidden Planet, which had comic books and specialty scifi books. You have the Strand, which is this fantastic used bookstore. We had I think it was the original outlet of Barnes & Noble over a few blocks further north from there. And, of course, you also have here in New York probably the greatest public library system in the world. This is like part of what makes New York an amazing place. But it's important when you're thinking about this issue to not think with these sort of narrow New York blinders on and to recall that you know lots of people live in places that are not as big, places that do not have as many  did not traditionally have as much diversity in terms of book retailing, where you might be talking about a lengthy drive to one bookstore, a limited selection that's there, a library that, you know, maybe has some capacity to get loans from other places, but, again, it had its own kind of constraints. What you have in the digital space, it's this vast stockpile, you can get any kind of book you want. You can go get public domain books, download them for free off Amazon. And this is a  really like an incredible bounty. I think there's a red herring out there that on one side of this debate is people who love Amazon and on the other side of the debate are people who think books are an important cultural artifact. Culture matters. Books are crucial to our society. And that's exactly why it is so important that Amazon has made it cheaper, easier, and more convenient for people all around the country and in a growing number of countries, to access these crucial cultural artifacts. Books aren't widgets. Books matter. And that's why it's so important that you recognize that Amazon truly is the reader's friend and vote for this resolution. Thank you."

    "data": "Well, I listened to Matt carefully, and I want to begin with a major concession. He is not totally insane. The  he is right, of course, about certain things. Amazon charges low prices. Amazon has built a better mousetrap. Their software is great. But that's really not here  all that we're here to talk about. The question isn't whether Jeff Bezos bears some faint resemblance to Lex Luthor. The question is whether Amazon is the reader's friend. And in defining that  or I'd like to be a little lawyerly, I'd like to talk about two things and focus on two words. The first, of course, is reader's, because readers are more than mere consumers. We agree that books are more than widgets. They bear our culture, thought, knowledge with them. And as Frank Foer is going to talk about when he comes to the podium, Amazon is doing great damage to our literary culture. The second word and perhaps one I want to focus on most is the word, friend. Friend, as we commonly understand the term, means somebody you can rely on to treat your interests as equal to their own. And instead what the record demonstrates is that Amazon is nobody's friend but Amazon's. They are capitalists of a particularly ruthless breed who, in point of fact, have habitually turned on their business allies whenever it meets their business needs. And, in point of fact, Matt, they are beginning to do this now to readers. Matt concedes that Amazon has a huge market share. I don't  even sort of waving your hands and saying that I don't think does full justice to the magnitude of the power Amazon currently exerts. They sell threefourths of the physical books that get sold in this country online. They sell at least that many eBooks, especially when you count the market that's starting to grow where Joe is  has been so successful, that is to say, selfpublished authors. There are parts of the book market that Amazon literally just owns. They have bought up the two largest producers of audio books. They bought the biggest seller of used and rare books, of books sold to the international market, of print on demand books, of selfpublished  physical selfpublished books, and, of course, they've swallowed up sites like GoodReads, or, BookFinder, that might have become competitors to them, another place where readers could have bought books. Now, to Matt I have to say that anybody who believes that Amazon will use this power only in friendship has not read Lord Acton or Machiavelli. Amazon already pushes books forward on their site at the expense of others for business purposes, or worse, for political purposes, and their tactics vary between the ruthless to the underhanded. Is Amazon being the reader's friend, Matt, when they alter search results in exchange for promotional payments without acknowledging to their readers that they do that? Or consider the subject you talked about, the chokehold that Amazon got on eBooks with the introduction of the Kindle in 2007. First  and the only innovation in the Kindle, by the way, was not the device. It wasn't eink. All  it wasn't digital books. All of those had existed. The innovation was when Amazon convinced the publishers to allow digital books, eBooks, to be sold at the same time that hardcovers went on the sale  went on sale. The publishers agreed, and as soon as they did that, friendly Amazon backstabbed the publishers and began selling eBooks at a loss of $3 to $4 apiece on average. Now, people like to say that Amazon sold eBooks at a loss to promote the sale of the Kindle. That frankly is bologna. If you want to promote Kindles, sell them at a loss. Amazon sold eBooks at a loss for two reasons, to stifle competition  they wanted to prevent anybody else, competing device makers, places like bookstores, which would've been a great place to buy eBooks  they wanted to prevent them from going into the market in competition with them. They artificially  the second thing they did by selling at a loss is they tilted the market away from physical books, the books published by the publishers who had gone into this business with them, and, of course, in the process, put businesses like Borders, not to mention thousands of bookstores, out of business. And this loss selling was not honest freemarket competition on a level playing field. It was frankly a mugging sponsored by Wall Street. For 20 years since the company was established, Wall Street has given Amazon unlimited capital, clearly with the expectation that even though the company didn't report a profit, sooner or later they would reap the immense profits that are bound to come from knocking all the competition aside. Then last year, Amazon  Wall Street finally became concerned. When is this company ever going to make a profit? The Amazon share price slid by 25 percent, and Amazon reacted by squeezing its suppliers, which is to say publishers and authors, and, of course, readers. This is what led to the dispute between Hachette and Amazon where Amazon punished not only the company but also Hachette authors by subverting the sale of Hachette books. They disserved authors like Joe, selfpublished authors, by starting a subscription series that undercut the income of authors like Joe, who's admitted that in print. And finally, of course, Amazon started raising book prices. The company that announced in 2001 it would sell any book over $20 at a 30 percent discount no longer adheres to that practice."

    "data": "Wow, I am so happy to be here, and I'm glad you're all seated after listening to Scott's monologue because he just proved that Amazon is engaging in nefarious acts of capitalism. I'm smiling right now  seriously, what the heck am I doing on this panel? We've got two journalists on this panel. We've got a lawyer on this panel. We've got a lawyer on this panel who did what all the lawyers wish they could do. He actually saved an innocent man from death row. He did. Okay. That's enough. His head is big enough. Innocent man from death row. These guys went to Harvard. They went to Stanford. They went to Columbia University. I went to Columbia College. It is not affiliated. I majored in Budweiser. And you think oh, that's a blow off major, but I still only got a 2.2 GPA. You know what, that may have been a 2.2 blood alcohol level. I couldn't remember the finals at all. I'm telling you. But I am very happy to be up here and I'm going to keep smiling because I really can't believe that I am here. Who's seen the movie The Paper Chase? It's about a Harvard law student working his butt off, taking classes, studying to actually become a big lawyer, and Scott actually did that. And when I went to school I was in my dorm making a sofa out of empty beer cans. So why am I here? I don't know why I'm here. Okay, I've sold some books. Okay, I like Amazon. By a show of hands, how many people here have bought something from Amazon? Okay. That is everybody in the room. By a show of hands, how many people hate raising their hands? That's meta. You're going to laugh about that later. Let's get on topic here. Scott brought up publishers. Amazon is the big bad guy, but what about these publishers? Well, you know what? Publishers are the bad guy and I'm going to tell you why. He said earlier we need publishers for culture, for rich literary culture. That's incorrect. Publishers don't write books. Authors write the books. Authors are the ones who impart this rich literary culture. The publishers are just highpriced middle men, okay? Let's talk about publishers and all of the books they have rejected. Publishers reject hundreds of books for everyone that they publish. Now think about that. That's censorship. It really is. There are thousands of books out there that you have never seen because the guardians of culture, those publishers, have never published them. Nine of them were mine. I got more than 500 rejections. Yeah, I know, every time the mailman came I had to pop a Prozac. I eventually did get published after my 10th book and then I learned more about publishers. I learned that publishers charge too much. Scott's new book, which I'm sure is excellent, the publisher nicely printed the price right on the cover, $28.00 for a hardcover. Wow, 28 bucks. If you can't afford that and you're a huge Turow fan you can wait a year and get the cheaper priced paperback. That's called windowing. That doesn't seem like publishers are really friends to readers. They would give them that paperback earlier because the paperback vastly outsells the hardcover. Publishers give out advances. They give an author an advance. Now, I got a nice advance according to Publisher's Weekly, $30,000 bucks and I was pleased to get it and I felt I was really lucky because the average advance is $5,000. You're not going to live off $5,000, especially since publishers pay you that over the course of three years. In small payments twice a year, because publishers only pay twice a year. It  a word on advances before I get off that topic, an advance has to be paid back in copies sold, okay? And it's a very high interest loan. If I selfpublish on Amazon, which I have done successfully many times, in fact since I started selfpublishing on Amazon, my income went up 20 percent. Oh no wait. That's wrong. It went up 20 times. So it went up 2,000 percent. My best year traditionally published I made 50 grand. Last year I made a million dollars. That's still 50 grand after taxes. What it comes down to is publishers are deciding what you read and what you won't read. They decide how you get it and how much you pay for it and they have that much power because they are a cartel. They are a form of monopoly called an oligopoly. The top five publishers control 80 percent of all the print books. As a writer, if I want to get into a bookstore, I have to go through those publishers. And they don't have to pay me anything, because there are 10 guys behind me who want my spot. Amazon looked at this market and they decided publishers weren't reader's friends. So, they innovated. They opened the world's biggest bookstore with the best customer service. They invented the ebook reader that everybody wants, along with the app that everybody wants. They gave all authors a chance to reach readers. So, my nine books that sat on a shelf finally got out there and reached readers. And I guess readers like them, because I sold a million of them. In other words, Amazon looked at all the things publishers were doing wrong and then they did them right. And rather than try to compete, the publishers colluded and price fixed to raise prices. We'll talk more about that a little later. This debate is not about Amazon being the writer's friend, though. I can give you examples that they are, but that's not what this is about. It's not about Amazon being the publisher's friend. That's not this debate. It's not about Amazon being a monopoly. That's not the debate. It is about Amazon being the reader's friend. Amazon isn't perfect. No person is. No company is. But let me tell you something. If Amazon right now were building a death machine that was fueled by the screams of puppies it still wouldn't matter because they're still a friend to readers. Thank you."

    "data": "Well, I'm feeling real good about the literary future right now. Listening to these guys come out here and talk in such fawning, slavish terms about a corporation. Amazon is a company. They are not  they are not pursuing the greater good. They're not pursuing cultural greatness. They are a company out to make a bunch of money. They have done this extremely well. They produce things at very low prices. They have technologically innovated all over the place. I use Amazon. You use Amazon. And there isn't anything wrong about that. The problem is this  it's that they have done it extremely well. And  and a company can perform at a very high level, and in turn, obtain a monopoly. They can be the only player. Matt says they aren't a monopoly. But when you control 70 percent of a market, that, historically, counts as a monopoly. In the old days, it  before  before the Reagan Revolution, before the Chicago School of Economics trashed antitrust law, our authorities used to get upset when companies controlled 10 percent of any given market. Not 70 percent  nearly 70 percent of any given market. But this is different. This is books. This is about our crown intellectual jewels. This is about the thing that we should care most about in the world, because it's about imagination. It's about understanding our past. It's about rooting out people in power. And when you have one company that sits there, and is the chokehold for books, that becomes a problem. It may not be a problem just now, but it will become a problem in the future. And it's something that we, as readers, as citizens, as guardians of the book, need to pay incredibly close attention to. Why do I care about this? Well, when I wrote an article about Amazon in the New Republic, what was their immediate response? They yanked ads from the New Republic. When it  they were having the dispute with Hachette, the publishing company  what did they do? Well, they punished the guy who wrote the book about the Koch brothers, but they let Paul Ryan's book go unscathed. They didn't punish him. When a company has that chokehold, when they can decide who wins and who loses in the publishing game, we need to be very, very afraid as citizens. So  what is Amazon? Amazon is the everything store. Their ambitions are boundless. They name themselves after the largest river in the world. They're making Woody Allen movies  television shows now. They're selling you your underwear, your socks. They want everything. They want nothing else to be able to breathe on this planet except for their consumers and the people who make their goods. And so that's a very, very dangerous thing, and we've seen this with publishing. We've seen the way that they've treated book publishers to date. It's not the worst offenses in the world. They're trying to  whatever. But it's bad, and it portends bad things. They've thrown around their power in order to try to continually squeeze the publishers. Now, I want to just say something in defense of publishers because they've been trashed considerably tonight, and I have a feeling that a lot of this debate will come down to a referendum on book publishing. Yeah, book publishers suck. They're an oligopoly. They're five big publishers. They're not great, but there are going to be a lot less of them because when companies see one big powerful player who controls their market, their natural instinct is to huddle together in safety and to cower. And that's what's happening now. Penguin merges with Random House. Hachette tries to buy Perseus. And that's going to continue in the face of Amazon, and that's going to continue to just squeeze the diversity out of our intellectual space. Now, what publishers don't do a great job always of picking books, although you have  when you look at the shelves in your library, you have to say, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Zadie Smith, that they've done a pretty good job of picking winners in the past. But that process of picking winners is incredibly important. If you go to Amazon's self publishing page and you look at the selfpublished authors, there are thousands of them. And I have no idea which one of them to read. I am too lazy as a reader. I don't have enough time to go read the first chapters of all these books in order to determine what's good. I look to publishers to see that somebody other than the author's mother thinks that the book is worth reading. So they play an important role  in sifting through the market, which is one great thing that they do. The second thing that they do is that they help authors who are usually introverts and nerds and very bad at selfpromotion  break through in the world. And, you know, they don't  they didn't do that for Joe Konrath? Well, you know, shame on them. But they do a good job of that for many, many, many other authors. Now, the most important thing that they do  and Joe is talking about fiction, which is fine. I think it's a different market than nonfiction. Nonfiction books often involve deep reporting, many trips to the archives. They're very, very expensive to produce. You can't just sit up one day and say, I'm going to go write a biography of Virginia Woolf. That's expensive. You got to go travel to England. You've got to  you've got to photocopy things. You know, and in the way that you are able to finance a project like that is by an advance. They are Kickstarter for authors. They pay authors a little bit of money at the beginning of a project which enables them to complete  to complete that. And I could be wrong here, but I can't even  I was trying to think if I could think of any self published nonfiction books that have been successful, any great biographies or histories, and I couldn't do that. And that stuff is going to suffer in this new world. And so I think in this debate, you are readers. You are the defenders of the book. The presumption here should be that anything that is distantly threatening to the book is something that you should be very, very concerned about. Anything that threatens this wonderful intellectual ecosystem that we have, which is already imperiled in so many different ways, shapes, and forms, needs defenders. It's your obligation here to step up, to send a message to Amazon, and to defend the book. Thank you."

    "data": "John, thanks. And I really appreciate the opportunity to be here. This subject is very important to me. It's really been my life. It started  I grew up on a  on a family farm in the central part of the United States. I was one of those  I wouldn't have thought of myself as a nerd, but I was one of those kids who always knew he wanted to be a scientist. And I had the  I had the unique privilege, after getting my doctorate degree, to attend the University of California at San Francisco, which was kind of the epicenter where GMO research started. And even back then, it was pretty clear that GMO technology would have a profound implication in health care. And just as a quick test of the audience  how many of you know anybody who's a diabetic and takes insulin? So, a lot of hands. So, actually, insulin was the first GMO product. And now, you know, that's the typical treatment. And it's a safer, better product. Today, in health care, just to give you a sense of the transformation, six of the topselling drugs in the United States are based on GMO technology. So, tremendous progress. Let me  let me make it a little more food related. How many of you eat cheese? All right. The first actual GMO product ever approved for food use was a product called rennet. Rennet is the enzyme that's actually used to make cheese. And today, 90 percent of our cheeses are based on GMOs, using a safer approach and a more effective way of making the technology. So, as I said in the introduction, you know, I helped develop the first GMO plants back in the  in the early 1980s. And then we took about another 15 years of additional studies and development before the first commercial products were launched in the  in the mid 1990s. And those were products that helped farmers protect against insects and protect against weeds. So, for insect protection, we actually use the very same BT protein that is used by organic farmers for years, and built that into the plants to protect them from insects. And as a result of that, we saw dramatic reduction in insecticide use and an increase in  in crop yields. And the herbicide tolerant crops, and herbicide tolerant crops have been a great enabler. They've enabled farmers to use safer and more environmentally friendly chemicals and replace the products that were previously used, but they've also had a profound benefit to the environment, of enabling farmers to not plow their soils. And as a result, use less energy, release less carbon, and  and reduce erosion, which have been key. Today, if you look around the world, GMO crops are grown in about 27 countries. They're being used by 18 million – [unintelligible] farmers. And to put it in perspective, this has been the most rapidlyadopted technology in the history of agriculture. And that's because the benefits have been so real and so clear. As I said, it's reduced pesticide use. It's helped farmers to produce more food and bring it, you know, from their harvest into  into the  into the  into consumption. It's preserved our soils. It's reduced greenhouse gas emissions and a lot of benefits. Now, you're going to hear different perspectives tonight on the technology. But here's a simple logic test. As I said, I grew up on a farm. I've watched my dad make those decisions on which seeds to buy, which equipment to use, et cetera, et cetera. I can tell you that there's no farmer who would plant GMO crops if they didn't have a real benefit. And they certainly wouldn't have planted them for the last 20 years if they didn't have real value. So, the impact of GMOs has been amazing, and lots of applications across companies and universities. And my partner, Dr. Alison Van Eenennaam, is going to describe a lot of those applications that are still being developed. I'd like to step back and say, as a scientist and a father, the safety of these products is  is absolutely on the  on the top of my mind. And what I'm most proud about is the fact that these technologies have been in the marketplace for over 20 years, and there's not been a single, not one issue of food or feed safety ever associated with the technology. And I'd make this point, that there's a strong scientific consensus on the safety of GMOs, as I  as there is on the role of greenhouse gases and climate change, so that's  that's very important. The last area I'd like to highlight is that the safety actually starts with the fact that mankind has been genetically modifying and selecting crops from the beginning of time. And whether you're looking at modernday corn or tomatoes, or you're looking at peaches or soybeans, we've been moving genes around from the  from the beginning of time. But through biotechnology, we're able to do it even more precisely, literally one gene at a time, and that's key. Also, this technology is highly regulated. It's regulated by the government agencies in the U.S. But it's important to realize that we export grains to 40 countries around the world who have all researched and approved these products. Alison's going to talk about some of the safety studies. Bottom line from those studies is these are the most thoroughly studied foods in our food supply, and they are absolutely safe. Now, let me make a couple of quick points as a scientist who's been involved in this his  his whole career. First of all, GMOs are not the Holy Grail. What they are is an important tool, if used properly, can have a huge impact in bringing remarkable new products to farmers and benefit consumers for a long time. Second, GMOs aren't the only tool we need. We need to continue to invest in plant breeding, we need to continue to invest in new areas like precision agriculture. We need to invest in organic farming techniques and other tools. And finally, let me just say, GMOs, are they perfect? Absolutely not. You know, they need to be regulated, they need to be managed wisely, like  like any technology. And, for example, we know that insects can become resistant to GMO crops just like they can to other insecticides. We know that  that weeds can evolve resistance, whether, you know, to herbicides, whether those are herbicides used in GMO crops or other systems. But I also know that  and I acknowledge that these are legitimate concerns, but I also know that the science can make a huge impact to manage these technologies. So  and this is so key as we  as we think about the future, because we are on the brink of facing one of mankind's greatest challenges. Global population continues to grow. It's going to reach 9.5 billion by 2050. Another 2 or 3 billion people will join the middle class. The demand for food will double by 2050. And so the decisions we make and the votes that you make tonight are really important. We will need to produce more food in the next 36 years than we have in the entire history of the world. So, it's a daunting challenge, and we're going to have to do that in the face of climate change and water shortage as we go forward. But I want to be clear, and I want to leave you with this optimistic note as I summarize. We can do this, but it means working together, and it means  finding a common ground."

    "data": "Thank you very much, and thanks to Robb. He made a number of points that I think we're going to come back to over the  over the course of the debate. But I want to focus my remarks, really, on just one point, and that is whether or not genetically modified or genetically engineered  I'm going to use those two words interchangeably  whether those technologies are essential or even an important technologies for meeting the challenge of feeding 9 billion people without destroying the earth. And that means raising our productivity but without dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico, without a Lake Erie or that has  you know, in some parts of the year is now just a toxic algal soup. It's a huge challenge. Now, I'm going to argue against that. But I understand why a lot of people believe that genetic engineering is the answer. And I think a lot of that has to do with the way the technology debuted. I mean, I was there in the early days when Monsanto came up with its products. I was working in Washington, D.C. for the environmental community. The place was abuzz with the idea that a new molecular technology was on the way that would convert agriculture into an environmentally benign activity. I was at the wildlife  at the National Wildlife Federation when Monsanto folks came and said, You people in the environmental community ought to be the first to embrace this technology because it's going to reduce pesticide use. I wanted to learn more, and I did when I went to Monsanto and got the tour out in St. Louis. And I was told, it's not only going to reduce toxic use of chemist  of chemicals, it's going to produce crops that can fertilize themselves. It's going to produce crops that are high yielding, that'll make famine a thing of the past, that are re  resistant to stress, to cold, to drought, to heat. It was a  it was a really compelling and  and a vision I was really taken by. My big question was that it was a brandnew technology using very new techniques, and would it work? Well, we have had now 30 years to find out whether it's going to work, billions of dollars in investment in it. And I think there's just no doubt that compared to the vision, the early vision, it's a big disappointment. Now, after 30 years, there are no crops out there that fertilize themselves. There's one droughttolerant crop that's drought tolerant because of genetic engineering. There are no crops whose yields are the result of genetic engineering apart from making them better able to deal with pests. You know, there are no genetically engineered crops that resist water logging. I mean, you name it. It really hasn't happened, with one exception, which we've heard about, which is in the area of pest management, genetic engineering has been wildly successful. I mean, people have adopted it all over the world. And  and that's because in the early days, the technology did deliver. It made it possible  people that use Roundupready crops and Bt crops in the early days, their pesticide use went down. That's why their costs down, that's why their farms were easier to manage, even as they got bigger. And farmers  you know, farmers were really happy about that. But, you know, as one farmer has said, not too recently, the days of  I mean, we've run through the best herbicide that the  that the world had to offer. Glyphosate is no longer as useful as it once was, and it's getting less useful every day because resistant weeds are coming, and those resistant weeds are leading to more  those resistant weeds are leading to greater and greater use of herbicides. And we are now at a point where, I mean, if you look forward, I'm going to let my colleague, Dr. Benbrook talk about this more, but there is, you know, nothing ahead of us except skyrocketing use, not only of Glyphosate, which is the major herbicide in Roundup, but of other herbicides  2,4D, Dicamba  herbicides we thought we'd never have to use much of  much of again. So, I guess to answer what I want I do want to say that we we now know why. I mean, genetically engineered  it turns out to be a lot harder to do genetic engineering than I think anybody thought in the early days. And it's especially hard when you're dealing with complex traits that involve a number of genes. That's why yield and stress resistance have proven to be so difficult. But these pesticide technologies have involved really only the transfer of a single gene, and they  you know, they have worked in the case of the two products we've talked about. But, you know, to answer my first question, a technology that, after 30 years, has not delivered, you know, on the full  on the full range of products that it kind of promised to the public early on, and in the one application where it has delivered, the benefits of the technology are now being reversed, and we are going in the direction of increased herbicide use. I mean, that is not a technology that is either essential or I would argue even important to addressing the major agricultural challenges ahead of us. Fortunately, we've got other technologies out there. They're far more powerful than genetic engineering. They’re traditional breeding and agro economy  ecology we're going to talk about them later. But before we can talk about them, we need to be clear about what genetic engineering can't do. And we don't want to ban it, we don't want to abandon research on it, but we do kind of want to move it off to the side of the of the stage. And in order to do that, you have to rebalance the debate. You have to kind of take the rose colored glasses off and you can start that process right here, right tonight, by voting No on Genetically Modify Food."

    "data": "Wow, it's a great turnout here tonight, it’s not my usual audience. I spend a lot of my time talking to farmers and ranchers. And it's my pleasure to be here speaking to you tonight. I'd like to start with a premise that I hope we can all agree on, and that is in the future more people are going to need to be fed better with less environmental impact. And as a public sector scientist, my interest is finding realworld solutions to that problem. And to me GM food offers one of those solutions. It's derived from crops produced using a breeding method based on the movement of useful genes from one species into another. Tonight I'll spend some time discussing the impressive safety record of GM crops, how they've provided welldocumented benefits, and how GM is sometimes uniquely able to deliver a useful trait like crops that are more resilient to climate change. And I will contend that the benefits of GM are too great to vote anything but Yes for GM tonight. GMO technology often gets conflated with Monsanto and Big Ag, but it's actually a breeding tool, one that can be used for many purposes. In my own research, in selection for disease resistant cattle, I use many breeding methods, including classical selection for healthy animals and, more recently, the use of DNA markers to assist in selecting for disease resistant genes. As a geneticist I can envision how combining GM with these other breeding methods, because they are not mutually exclusive, could accelerate the progress of my publicly funded research program by enabling me to use GM to directly protect cattle from infection. This would be associated with reduced illness and the decreased use of antibiotics, something I think is perhaps a common shared value amongst this group. As Robb mentioned, most commercialized GMO crops today have been made to resist insects and herbicides and have been adopted by 18 million farmers globally, but importantly 16.5 million of those farmers are in the developing world, both men and women, some of whom farm areas smaller than the size of the auditorium tonight. What have been the impacts of this widespread adoption? As a scientist I go to the independent, peerreviewed literature to answer such questions, especially reviews and metaanalyses that present a summary of many independent studies. It's like a well informed referee presenting an objective assessment of the state of play. Recently, German university professors published a comprehensive analysis of 147 separate studies that assess the impact of GM crops. They found that the benefits were significant not only in the U.S. but more importantly in the developing world. On average, GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37 percent, increased yields by 22 percent, and increased farmer profits by 68 percent. The yield gains are due to more effective pest control and thus lower crop damage. And the benefits have been largest for smallholder farmers in developing countries who have dramatically reduced their insecticide applications as a result of GM crops. This has benefitted both farmer health and also the environment and beneficial insects. Now researchers throughout the public and private sector are using this breeding tool to deliver other benefits to society. Researchers at Hawaii and Cornell University have used it to produce a virus resistant papaya, a product which has literally saved the Hawaiian papaya industry. Other introductions include drought resistant corn, virus resistant squash, consumer traits like a nonbrowning apple, a lowacrylamide potato, and crops that produce oils improved for nutrition. None of these applications require the use of any chemical pesticides, an issue that often gets conflated with this technology. University researchers are working to develop GM oranges that are resistant to citrus greening disease, something that is devastating the Florida orange industry. And here in New York, researchers are using a wheat gene to develop GM American chestnut trees resistant to the imported chestnut blight. If approved, these trees will be distributed to the public in a not for profit program to restore the American chestnut tree to the eastern forests. Plant diseases annually destroy some 15 percent of our world's agricultural harvest, a number that is likely to grow as our climate changes. There are many publicly funded groups around the world, working to develop GM disease resistant varieties of crops, including apples, bananas, cassava, cowpea, eggplant, grapes, potatoes, rice, sweet potatoes, and wheat. Some of these staple crops are an essential source of nutrient in the diets of the poor. And it doesn't stop at plants. Researchers at CUNY are working with an international consortium to develop geneticallyengineered cattle that are resistant to African Sleeping Sickness, a disease that kills several thousand people and three million cattle annually. This project is being publicly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the U.S. National Science Foundation. All of these GM applications focus on controlling disease with genetics rather than chemicals, an objective that I would argue is compatible with agroecology, sustainability, and feeding more people better with less environmental impact. There are literally dozens of other applications and field trials globally. Nitrogenefficient and floodtolerant rice. Droughttolerant wheat. And BioCassava Plus, a privatepublic partnership that will use GM to increase the nutrient levels, shelf life, and disease resistance of cassava, a major source of carbohydrates in parts of the world. Improved cassava harvests could increase the incomes of African households, helping lift poor farmers  many of them women  out of poverty. I could go on, but none of this would be possible without the broad scientific consensus about the safety of GM and solidated [spelled phonetically] and support that consensus. A 2013 review article, written by independent Italian public sector scientists, reviewed over 1,700 scientific records on GE crop safety published this past decade, and concluded that the scientific research conducted so far has not detected any significant hazards directly connected with the use of GE crops. My own 2014 review paper examined both well designed animal feeding studies and the field performance and health trends of the over 100 billion food producing animals that have been consuming GM feed over the last decade, and found no credible evidence of harm. The American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest and most prestigious scientific society, stated in 2012 that science is quite clear: crop improvement by modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe. They're joined by the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the British Royal Society, and every major regulatory agency in the world. Given the realized benefits, the potential of this science, and the documented safety record, I urge you to allow breeders to use this valuable method to improve crops and vote yes for tonight's motion."

    "data": "Thanks, folks, and thanks to Intelligence Squared for having me back. I figured I used up my welcome last time, but glad to be back again. Well, I guess the reason we're having a debate is perhaps there isn't complete agreement on some of the things that we've been discussing already. In fact, you know, Robb and Alison, if all of what you said was true, I would be over there at your side of the table, going at it with  with poor Mardi all by herself. I do think it's time for sort of a national fireside chat about the applications of agricultural biotechnology in food production. And I'm actually glad it's happening. We've had a number of highly contested state level ballot initiatives on labeling of GE food. And as a result, the awareness and consciousness of people around the country is going up. And that's a good thing. The  there's tough choices for our society about whether we want to go down this road of more intensive, specialized input intensive agriculture, kind of with genetic engineering leading the train, or whether we want to steer agriculture in some other directions. So, a couple of things I ask of the audience, as you listen to the back and forth tonight. And there'll be  there'll be a lot of it. I ask you to vote on the reality of what genetically engineered crops, the ones that are on the market today, have actually brought about, and not just how well they work for the first three or four years. And I think, you know, the record is very clear, they were rapidly adopted. They worked very well. They were spectacularly effective in particularly the Roundup Ready crops. And these are the socalled herbicide tolerant crops, which made it easy for farmers to control weeds in corn, soybeans, and cotton. Those were the three big crops. We'll mostly talk about those tonight. So, don't  you know, don't base this on the promise and the aspirations of the biotechnology industry and the things that the biotech industry thinks that at some point the science will deliver, things like corn plants that fix their own nitrogen or drought tolerant crops or nutritionally enhanced crops. Some of these things may eventually be achieved, but they haven't yet. And I ask you to think about the  what's the reality of genetic engineering agriculture today as opposed to the promise or the aspiration. I also suggest and ask you to think about the impacts of genetically engineered crops as a package. It's not just the genes that Robb Fraley and his colleagues at Monsanto were able to work into the corn plant, but you have to think about how that corn plant behaves in the field, the yields, what the impacts of the BT proteins that are all throughout that plant are on the environment, on aquatic ecosystems, on the cost to farmers. And, of course, in the case of the herbicide tolerant crops, the great concern is this huge increase in herbicide use that's started about a decade ago and has gotten worse and worse and worse each year. And now the  the industry and the government has just approved the next generation of herbicidetolerant crops that are now engineered to tolerate two of the riskiest old herbicides that have been in use for a long time. You'll hear the word 2, 4D and Dicamba. This is definitely not a step in the right direction. So, we have to think about the totality of the impacts, including we have put so much energy as a country, and the industry has put most of its plantbreeding effort or eggs in the GE basket for these herbicide tolerant crops and BT crops. And there's a lot of other priorities that plant breeders have not focused on as seriously as they should have. And that is a cost of the technology. We're going to talk a lot about safety today. Rest assured there is no consensus about the safety of GE foods, and there are a number of reasons to be more concerned in 2014 than we were in 1996, the year that they were introduced, or in 2000, which was about the time the adoption of herbicide tolerant soybeans was very high. And, really, with each passing year, as more and more GE plants are grown, as more herbicides are required to bring them to harvest, the list of both health concerns and environmental concerns is growing. And I'm sure we'll get back to them. There was a National Geographic, wonderful National Geographic series about the future of food the last year. And perhaps many of you read at least some of them. In the May 2014 issue of National Geographic, there was kind of a capstone piece that sort of presented a plan forward  to meet the needs of 9 billion people on an earth with shrinking resources. And this guy, Jonathan Foley, an academic from the University of Minnesota, he wrote a piece, A FiveStep Plan to Feed the World. It's really a great piece. It's short. So, here's where his five steps, and I quote exactly how he states them. Freeze agriculture's footprint. And by this, in his discussion, he's talking about, let's not clear any more tropical rainforests. Let's leave most of the wild lands wild. Second, Grow more on the farms that we have. And this is absolutely right on. I mean, you know, in  in the developed world, farmers, you know, harvest 150 to 250 bushels of corn, in Africa, you know, 40 to 60. So, there's great potential around the world to raise the yields on the  on farms that really have worn out soils, don't have access to a lot of input. So growing more on the farms we have is clearly a critical part of the solution. His  Foley's third way to help feed the world, it was, Use resources more efficiently. This is kind of a nobrainer. It's  it's something that obviously most of the agricultural inputs that today's corn, soybean and cotton farmers use are petroleum based. As the price of energy goes up, their prices is going to go up. And perhaps their availability will come into question. So, obviously we have to use petroleumbased inputs more efficiently and water more efficiently. The fourth, a very important one: Shift diets. Us Americans, people in Europe, we  we eat very high on the hog. We eat a lot of meat, and it takes a lot of food calories to produce a single calorie of beef, about 100 to 1."

    "data": "Because much of modern medicine prolongs not living but dying, we need to rethink death itself. Making someone die in a way that others approve, but that he feels is anathema, is an odious form of tyranny. Aidindying needs to be tightly regulated, as any life or death matter does, from driving to surgery. But while no one should be pressed into assisted dying, no one should be categorically denied that right. It's about dignity. In his dissent in Cruzan, Supreme Court Justice William Brennan said, An ignoble end steeped in decay is abhorrent. A quiet, proud death, bodily integrity intact, is a matter of extreme confidence. And it's about reassurance. Brittany Maynard, who captured headlines for choosing to end her life at the age of 29 at the end of a battle with brain cancer, said, It has given me peace. I do not want to die, but I am dying, and I want to die on my own terms. It's not about depression. When hope of recovery is gone, when one achieves relief from physical symptoms only at the cost of mental clarity, when – one’s dignity is lost to physical deterioration, the wish to end your life may be rational. Now, there are some people who find great meaning in those very final stages. But there are other people who are not interested in finding that meaning. And from a nontheological point of view, it can be argued that the meaning people attach to that stage of life is an artifact of the human imagination. It's not about suicide. Suicide responds to personal disintegration while this precludes it. And it is about the limitations of medicine. It's nothing short of medical arrogance to say that palliative care and hospice can adequately deal with the end of every life. Hospice, in fact, can impose an authoritarian, hard, paternalistic view that the hospice way of dying is the only way, and it's rooted in precedent, as John said in the opening, in Oregon, where after 17 years, only 752 people have died from lethal prescriptions, which is to say .2 percent of the people in the state who have died. As Hillary once hoped for abortion, this is safe, legal and rare, and it has popular support. According to a 2013 Gallup Poll, 70 percent of Americans support legalization of physician assistance in dying. When my mother's friend, Sandy, was dying of cancer, my mother visited and saw her in the hospital where she was screaming in pain and so heavily medicated that she was unable to recognize the other people in the room. And when she came home, my mother said, If I ever get to that state of pain, promise that one of you will shoot me. My mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was 56. And when her first chemotherapy failed, she said that she would submit to another round of agonizing treatment only on the condition that someone got her those pills. By the time of her third chemo, she was in dilapidated health. She was vomiting. She had a persistent malaise, she had hair loss, she was negotiating surgical adhesions, but she also had the pills. And the agony became unimportant because the symptoms were permanent only until she decided that she could take no more, and then she would be free, and so the disease was no longer in control of her. My grieving father, my mother, my brother and I talked through the logistics as though a dress rehearsal would exhaust some of the pain of the loss in advance. We planned it together, much as we had once planned parties or family vacations or Christmas. We were liberated by our newly clarified emotions, but we were entombed in the loneliness of our illegal collusion. My mother went to see a gastroenterologist two years after she got sick, who told her that she had significant tumors in her intestines and would soon be unable to digest food. She called my brother and me, and she said that it was time. It was all very much as we had planned it. She said, The only thing I still fear is this not going smoothly. And she took the antiemetics. A few nights earlier, my mother and my brother had pulled a wishbone, and my mother had won. And now my brother said to her, What did you wish for? And she said, I wished for this to be over as quickly as possible. And I got my wish, I got my wishes so often. And then she said, When you were children, I wanted my love to make the world a safe place for you. And my greatest hope is that it will still wrap you up for your whole life. And she said to my father, I would gladly have given decades of my life to be the one to go first. For 30 years, Howard, you have been my life. And then as her voice slowed with the medication, she said, I'm sad to be going. But even with this early death, I wouldn't want to change my life for any other life in the world. I have loved completely, and I have been completely loved, and I've had such a good time. I've looked for so many things in this life, so many things. And all the time, paradise was in this room with the three of you. I've seen other deaths, and I remember feeling that they belonged to the hospital or the illness or the gun or the catastrophe. This death was my mother's own. She was the same person in death that she had been in life, and it was her right to choose it over a death like Sandy's, and it should be everyone's right. The words liberty and dignity are nearly synonymous in death as they are in love."

    "data": "As you heard, I am a physician. And part of my job is to help people die with dignity and in comfort. But I don't want to help you or your daughter or your uncle to commit suicide. And you shouldn't want me to. I urge you to oppose physicianassisted suicide, because it's bad ethical reasoning, bad medicine and bad policy. I'm going to concentrate on the first of these, and Ilora will take up the other two. Now we strongly support the right of patients to refuse treatments and believe physicians have a duty to treat pain and other symptoms even to the point of hastening death. But empowering physicians to assist patients with suicide is quite another matter. Striking at the heart not just of medical ethics, but of ethics itself. That's because the very idea of interpersonal ethics depends upon our mutual recognition of each other's equal independent worth, the value that we have simply because we are fellow human beings. Some would have you believe that mortality  that morality depends upon equal interests, usually defined by preferences, and of advanced utilitarian arguments based on that assumption. But which is more important: people or their preferences? As Aristotle observed, small errors at the beginning of an argument lead to large errors at the end. If interests take preference over the people who have them, then assisting the suicide of a patient who has lost interest in living is certainly something that would be morally praise worthy. But it would also follow that active euthanasia ought to be permitted, that the severely demented could be euthanized without their explicit consent, even experimented upon. And it also follows that infanticide ought to be permitted for children with congenital illnesses. Now, many might see these as frightful conclusions, but this is not just the slippery slope. These all follow logically from arguing for assisted suicide on the basis of maximizing our individual interests. So, if you don't believe in euthanizing severely disabled children or the demented, you might want to rethink your support for assisted suicide, at least if you want to be consistent. Now, is assisted suicide death with dignity? The word dignity has at least two senses. Proponents, like the one you heard, use the word in an attributed sense to denote the value others confer on them or the value they might even confer upon themselves. But there's a deeper, intrinsic sense of dignity. Human dignity ultimately rests not on a person's interests, but on the value of the person whose interests they are. I don't have to ask you what your preferences are to know that you have dignity. And Martin Luther King says that he learned this from his grandmother who told him, Martin, don't let anybody ever tell you that you're not a somebody. Somebodiness, this intrinsic sense of dignity, was at the heart of our civil rights movement. And the message is that it doesn't matter what a person looks like, how productive that person might be, how others view that person or even how that person may have come to have viewed herself. What matters is that everybody, black or white, sick or well, is a somebody. Now, assisted suicide and euthanasia require us to accept that it is morally permissible to act with the specific intention of making a somebody into a nobody, to make them dead. Intentions, not just outcomes, matter in ethics. Intending that somebody be turned into a nobody violates the fundamental basis of our interpersonal ethics, our intrinsic dignity. We live in a society that worships independence, youth, and beauty. Yet we know that illness and aging often bring dependence and disfigurement. The terminally ill, especially, need to be reminded of their intrinsic dignity at a time of fierce doubt. They need to know that their ultimate value doesn't depend upon how they look, how productive they are, or their independence. You see, assisted suicide flips the default switch. The question the terminally ill hear, even if never spoken, is You've become a burden for you and for us. Why haven't you gotten rid of yourself yet? Now, a good utilitarian might think that a proper question, even a moral duty, but as a physician who cares for dying patients, I am much more fearful of the burden this question imposes on the many who might otherwise choose to live, than the modest restriction imposed on a few when assisted suicide is illegal. Assisted suicide should not be necessary. If it's pain and other symptoms you fear, they can almost always be alleviated. As evidence, consider that pain or other symptoms rarely come up as the reasons for assisted suicide. The top reasons are: fear of being considered a burden and wanting to be in control. Now, you may ask, Why shouldn't I have this option? and yet we all realize that society puts many restrictions on liberty and for a variety of reasons, to protect others, to promote the common good, to safeguard the bases of morality and law. For example, we don't permit persons to drive drunk or to freely sell themselves into slavery. Paradoxically, in physician assisted suicide and euthanasia, patients turn control over to physicians who assess their eligibility and must provide the means. And, further, since death obliterates all liberty, saying that respect for liberty justifies the obliteration of liberty actually undermines the value that we place on human freedom. Now, Ilora and I live our lives dedicated to supporting patients and families, to listening to patients at the end of life, to relieving suffering, and to valuing them to the end."

    "data": "Thank you. Let's be clear what we are debating this evening. It's Legalize Assisted Suicide. It's not Put Utilitarianism into Practice, and it's also not anything further to do with other areas in which one may or may not think that sometimes death is preferable and ought to be provided. That is not the topic. You're asked to discuss  to focus only on this quite narrow question. Now, if you think about that question, we are, of course, influenced by the idea that normally death is a bad thing. We often think of it as the very worst thing that can happen to us. But if we ask ourselves why that should be, Why is death a bad thing? then we can think that there are a variety of reasons in normal circumstances. For instance, people want to go on living, so death is contrary to that very strong wish that people have. It violates their autonomy. If somebody else in particular kills them, it normally violates their autonomy, which is something that we ought to respect. Secondly, death ends your life, and most of us think of life as a positive, as a good thing, fortunately. So, it prevents you from continuing to live that life that you find worthwhile, that you find fulfilling and rich, that brings you happiness and other values. And, thirdly, death is a bad thing for those who love and care for the person who dies. It's a source of grief to them that someone they love dies. So that's why normally, of course, we should not promote death, let alone kill people. But there are very special circumstances in which none of these things apply, and that's what we're talking about tonight. There are circumstances in which the person who is considering death wants to die. That is their autonomous choice. So, death is not a violation of their autonomy, or contrary to their strongest wishes. But it's in accordance with them, as Andrew described in the case of his mother just now. Secondly, there are cases in which a person has no more valuable life to look forward to, valuable by their judgment, not valuable by somebody else's judgment imposing on them the idea that their life is still worthwhile, even though they, having thought the matter through  perhaps having thought it through for many years  again, as in the case Andrew described, have decided that life would not be worth living for them under some circumstances. And in particular, if they have only a short time to live, as in the case of the statutes in Oregon and Washington, and now Vermont as well, then they know that they cannot look forward to more years of happiness. And as for the grief that those who love them will feel, of course they will feel that grief if they die now. But in the cases covered by these statutes, where people are terminally ill and likely to die  two doctors certify that they will die, they have less than six months to live, then the family is going to grieve anyway. And the caring family  like Andrew and his brother  will at least feel that the person they love got to die at a time of their own choosing. And that's important. Now, in fact, this idea that this is sometimes a good thing is recognized by our opponents. Daniel Sulmasy just said that sometimes it's justifiable to relieve patients' pain, if you're hastening death. It's not the hastening death that they object to, because they acknowledge that you can withdraw treatment that would keep patients alive  sometimes would keep patients alive for a long time. It's the intention of ending a patient's life that they object to. But we don't have to accept that morality. That's a specific morality which Daniel Sulmasy is free to hold, of course. And if he  as he said at the beginning  would not like you  to help you end your life, that's entirely up to him. Nobody is suggesting he should be compelled to end anyone's life against his conscience. But if a different doctor  and there are such doctors  is willing to do that, indeed, thinks that that's the best final care that he can give to a patient who he can no longer restore to a situation that the patient considers worthwhile, then I don't  I don't think we should be hung up by this idea that something is somehow always a wrongful intention, even if in normal circumstances, to aim at someone's death would be a wrongful intention. But not in these circumstances. In these circumstances, it may be the right intention. Now, I'm sure we're going to hear from probably Ilora Finlay, I guess, that there are risks – that this is a dangerous thing  that it will lead to a slippery slope. That argument has been around in this debate for a long time. I think that when I first became interested in this question  which now goes back about 40 years. That that was an argument that you had to treat very seriously and had to give a lot of weight to. And I could not be completely sure that it was not justified. But now we have much more experience of the legalization of assisted suicide. We have, in the Netherlands  in fact, more than 30 years' experience of the open practice of  by the medical profession, with the support of the Royal Dutch Medical Society  not against the doctors' views  of that practice. And with its full legalization, about 14  about 12 years ago. And fully supported by the Dutch population, so that although there's been a succession of governments  some conservative, some more liberal, one of them under a Roman Catholic prime minister  they have not ever sought to repeal the legislation. And similarly, in Oregon, we now have 17 years of experience, a relatively small number of people dying each year. And as you heard, more of them requesting the prescriptions, but not using them, because they want the control. They want to know that they could end their life if they want to. So, with that experience, the experience of Belgium as well, which followed the Netherlands, its neighbor, and then Luxembourg, and then also Washington  the state of Washington, the neighbor of Oregon, which was watching what was going on there, and decided that was a good system that they wanted, and therefore accepted it  we have not seen a slippery slope here. We have, in fact, found that these  this legalization is something endorsed by the populations concerned and supported by it, and they want it to continue. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. I'm a palliative care physician. For over a quarter of a century, I've looked after dying patients, thousands. I've had countless conversations about death and dying, and supported each in what they tell me they need, not some kind of formulaic death. But I've seen despair return to enjoy life in new found, unexpected and treasured ways. It is through compassion that I see how dangerous it is to license doctors to provide lethal drugs. How much assistance is needed? Well, euthanasia, as practiced in the Netherlands by and large, more than physicianassisted suicide, is the injection of lethal drugs. Here in the U.S., that seems to be reserved for a state execution. It's pretty much the same drugs used. But let me tell you about someone. Let me tell you about David, aged 36. His spinal tumor was causing very difficult pain and incipient paraplegia. His surgeon, oncologist, and family doctor all thought his prognosis was three months. And I was asked to see him only because his doctors couldn't give him a lethal injection. He seemed a very clearcut case for assisted suicide. When I saw him, the distress was palpable. Their third child was six weeks old. David fitted every criteria of every bit of legislation I have ever seen. He had a clear, settled wish, had mental capacity, was not being coerced and was very, very distressed. It was October. I thought he'd be dead by Christmas. So what happened? After some persuasion, careful, gentle persuasion, he accepted my input. And gradually, he lost the wish to die. 11 years later, he phoned me. His lovely wife had pancreatic cancer and was dying. That baby, now 11, sat with his sister, brother, and dad holding his dying mum's hand. Is David an exception? No. He illustrates all the problems with proposals for assisted suicide. Let's look briefly at what happens in states which have changed the law. Over 16 years of Oregon's law, assisted suicides have risen four and a half to fivefold. In Washington state, which legalized assisted suicide in 2008, the rate of rise is fast deeper; 43 percent in one year alone. When you normalize physicianassisted suicide, the underlying social dynamic changes. Laws aren't just regulatory instruments. They send a message. And the message they send is that if you're terminally ill, ending your life is something that you probably ought to think about. Indeed, in Holland, when they changed their law, they thought their figures had plateaued, but they've actually doubled. And in Belgium, the Belgians are quite frank about the fact that they know that somewhere around about half are actually happening outside the law. Changing the law isn't simple and straightforward. So, what are some of the problems? Well, let's look at prognosis. Prognoses are notoriously inaccurate. Even the most expert have a 50/50 chance of being wrong over life expectancy of six months. Oregon's law requires a prognosis of six months or less, yet two years, nine months from request to death has been recorded. Pathologists tell us that at postmortem, about 1 in 20 are found to have died from something different to the condition they were being treated for. And how real is a settled wish? 40 percent of seriously ill people have some mental disturbance often attributed to the illness or anxiety or treatment. And in 13 to 14 percent, this is a major, treatable depression. Yet Oregon's own research shows a quarter of those seeking assisted suicide have depression, which is sometimes missed or overlooked. And research into a sample showed one in six of those given lethally  lethal drugs legally supplied actually had an undiagnosed, untreated depression. The researchers themselves said the current practice of Death with Dignity Act may not adequately protect all mentally ill patients. Capacity, it has to be situationspecific, decisionspecific. How do you assess capacity commensurate with the biggest decision that you could take; that to end your life? Only 6 percent of Oregon's psychiatrists feel confident to do it. Pressures are harder to pick up than depression. Coercion can be subtle, the costs of care, life insurance about to expire or just caregiver fatigue, the person who picks up that their family are stressed and doesn't want to be thought of badly. After all, most parents love their children, but not all children love their parents. And dignity, research has shown that the way that care is delivered enhances or undermines dignity. Cicely Saunders of the hospice movement said, Dignity is having a sense of personal worth. Yet in Oregon, 40 percent, and in Washington, 61 percent cite concerns of being a burden, and 80 percent are concerned at losing their dignity. Are they being made to feel their lives are an inconvenience to be disposed for the sake of others? And what of doctors? Like it or not, you rely on your doctor. For the doctor under pressure, it is all too easy to give into the pressure to prescribe. Doctors must recognize dying, not impose futile treatments and relieve distress. But I do not think they should be licensed to cut off life by weeks, months or years. Remember David? I saw him last weekend, 23 years on from that first referral. And he said I can tell his story. He brought up the children alone, fantastically well. But what would have happened if his doctor had been able to accede to his request? It is too dangerous to license doctors to prescribe lethal drugs for suicide. Please vote against this utilitarian motion. And it is utilitarian."

    "data": "Thank you so much for inviting me to share my research and knowledge about the question at hand. We are debating whether income inequality hampers the American dream of upward mobility. And I'm here to tell you that it does. Nick Hanauer and I hope to convince you that as income inequality has increased, the American Dream has been harder to achieve. If we think  as you've already heard already, the same analogy  if we think of income distribution as rungs on the ladder, and upward mobility  or mobility in general  is movements up and down the ladder, common sense tells you if the rungs get further apart, the ladder is going to be harder to climb. Let's start with the first part of the proposition. Research from a multitude of government and academic sources have indisputably found that income inequality has increased over the last generation. That is an established fact. The tremendous growth in income inequality comes at a cost to individuals, to families, and to society as a whole. We know from research that rising income inequality has not helped grow the size of the economy, and has likely even harmed growth. This makes the rise in inequality a zero sum game at best. Since inequality means that the larger shares are flowing to the top, middle, and bottom  the middle and bottom continue to get squeezed. Those consequences aside, the one cost we're discussing today is reduced access to the American Dream. The American Dream itself is a somewhat elusive concept. It's one of those you know it when you see it sort of things. To some it means the happiness of a normal, stable life. Not falling behind every year. It means a good job and a great future for your children. It means that if your kids work hard, they will find success. Working hard is the backbone of the American Dream. To know that your kids have the opportunity to do well, it is only for them to grab it, to seize the day. The most common concept economists use to measure upward mobility is intergenerational mobility. This is the extent to which your parents' economic position determines your position in adulthood. If your position on the earnings, income, or wealth scale is largely a function of your birth, then even the most talented coming from the lower rungs of society will have a hard time achieving success. Conversely, little correlation between parents and children means that one's economic fate can be directly determined through intelligence and hard work. So how do we raise the economic mobility of the U.S. today? Well, one way is to look at how we compare to other countries. Another way is to look at, historically, what has happened with mobility and discuss the pathways through which mobility is affected by opportunity. The fact that one's economic position in childhood determines one's position in adulthood more so in the U.S. than in many advanced countries. We have less mobility here than in Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden. We have less mobility than Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Germany, Spain, France. Let me talk for a moment about our peer to the north, Canada. Canada actually looks a lot like us, both in economic regime and in its diversity. But family background is twice as important in determining children's success in the U.S. than in Canada. Furthermore, among our peers, we are the most unequal society, and we have seen the greatest growth in inequality. Janet Yellen recently reiterated the fact that lower economic mobility is found in countries with higher income inequality. So, the American dream is more likely elsewhere than here and more likely in more unequal societies. Now, what's happened over time? The truth is that research on mobility has a few years before it can catch up to answer more definitively on this question. We have to wait until the children born in the most unequal times, let's say the last decade, until they grow up, and we can see, we can measure their incomes and their earnings. So far, high quality research has shown that economic mobility has been stagnant or declining over the last generation. Even so, it's impossible to know what the counter factual is. Perhaps the society got richer, economic mobility would have increased. So, finding stagnant mobility really doesn't answer the question. What is entirely clear and is known that income inequality leads to inequality of opportunity and resources, and this surely hampers mobility. When growing inequality means that poor kids don't get the proper nutrition they need or the glasses when they need them, then it's obvious they can't do as well in school. Opportunity for many often looks like education. Over time, highincome parents are  are making increasingly larger and larger investments in their children. And that's a good thing. But lower income families simply cannot afford to make those same investments. We've seen low income families increasing their investments from the 1970s to the 2000s, from about $835 per kid to about $1,300. At the same time, over that same period, high income families' investments went from 3,500 to nearly $9,000. And those investments pay off. It may come as no surprise that more affluent students score better on standardized tests. A recent study actually renamed the Scholastic Aptitude Test the Student Affluent Test. Those with higher family income who tend to be college educated allow parents to live in neighborhoods with better schools and pay for private schools. And it's a selfreinforcing cycle. This provides a direct link between growing inequality, growing gaps in opportunity and declining mobility. Over this period of growing income inequality, college graduation rates have become increasingly unequal. Both groups, the top and the bottom, have seen higher college graduation rates than before. But the bottom only increased by 4 percent while the top increased by almost 20 percentage points. What is even more troubling for society that defends the reality of the American dream is that lowscoring, highincome students are more likely to graduate from college than highscoring, lowincome students. That is, by definition, not about ability. It is about income. Everyone can't be in the top 1 percent. And we can all name stories of children who did succeed against all odds. But it's against the all odds part that we're here to talk about today. Has living in an increasingly unequal society made it harder to climb the rungs of the ladder? Unambiguously, the answer is yes."

    "data": "Well, thank you, John, and thanks to IQ Squared and to the Rosenkranz Foundation for sponsoring this debate, but also for creating a way to combat the polarization that I think it’s really been poisoning a lot of our discourse the last few years. And in that spirit, let me just start by noting a few areas where there's agreement I think with what Elise just said. First, I agree that there is a lot of income inequality in the United States. There's  frankly, there's a lot of income inequality on this stage. Like Elise, I'm also deeply concerned about inequality of opportunity. I can tell you that I became interested in these issues on April 29th, 1992 when the L.A. riots erupted during my freshman year of college. I believed then and still believe that  that poor children enjoy far too little upward mobility. What do I mean by that? Kids with the poorest parents tend, disproportionately, to end up among the poorest adults as well. Where I part ways with my opponents, and by the way, with my 19year old self, is that after a brief career in community organizing, after a not at all brief period in getting my PhD in Harvard's Inequality and Social Policy program, after managing the research agenda for the Pew Economic Mobility Project and continuing to study these issues at Brookings and now at the Manhattan Institute, after all of this, I  I've concluded that if you're, like me, concerned about inequality of opportunity, focusing on inequality of incomes is just misguided. So, my partner, Ed, and I are asking you to oppose the motion on the table. Whatever you think of the state of the American dream, income inequality does not impair it. Okay. So, Elise and I are going to disagree on a few things. In my mind, if  if income inequality were impairing the American dream of upward mobility, you ought to see two things jump out at you in the very big literature that we've got on this question. The first thing you would expect to see is that over the period where inequality was growing in the United States, that you would see falling upward mobility. Now, the  the consensus from a dozen studies on this question is easily summarized by the conclusion from the most recent paper that came to this conclusion. And I'll just quote: It found that mobility has remained remarkably stable over the second half of the 20th century in the United States. That finding is from Berkeley's Emmanuel Saez who, along with Thomas Piketty, who's the most famous economist of the year for sure. They're the two who develops the top 1 percent estimates that we all have seen everywhere. So, that's his conclusion. The second conclusion you would expect to see is, if high inequality impairs upward mobility, is that places with a lot of inequality would have lower mobility. And you heard Elise mention that the U.S. has less mobility than other countries. That was certainly the conventional wisdom I would argue until this year. In a paper published this year, a Canadian economist named Miles Corak, who had originated this thing called The Great Gatsby Curve, that some of you might have heard of, that Janet Yellen talked about in her speech. Earlier this year, his most recent paper highlights real serious problems with that chart and the previous research. What he did in this newest paper is to team up with an American economist and a Swedish economist. And the three of them looked at their own countries, compared mobility across them, were very careful to measure them comparably, and they found, quote, we find almost no differences in upward mobility between Canada, Sweden and the United States. Meanwhile, Saez’s team, in a second study this past year, found that developed countries with higher income concentration have mobility rates that are no lower than countries that are low inequality. And they found the same thing to be true of American counties. Okay. My opponents want you to believe that if the top 1 percent hadn't made as much in the past 35 years, that the bottom and the middle would have made more, that they pay an inequality tax you sometimes hear. But research again finds that in rich countries, those that experience bigger increases in inequality, have experienced bigger income gains at the bottom and in the middle, not smaller. Now, how can that be? Well, Ed is going to talk to you about the research on inequality and economic growth. We disagree, I think, with our opponents on that as well. But essentially, the research finds that countries with more inequality actually experience more economic growth. So, essentially if you enlarge the pie enough, the economic pie enough, then the poor and middle class actually can get more pie even if their slice becomes skinnier. If you claim that absent rising inequality, the middle class would have had thousands of dollars more than they did, as you sometimes hear, there are a couple of really big assumptions hidden behind that. One is that if we had capped the incomes at the top, that the economic pie would have become just as big as it actually did. The second assumption is that if we had capped those incomes, then essentially the proceeds would be equally distributed across the population. Now, in actuality, if we somehow managed to cap the incomes of the top 1 percent, what would likely happen is we'd be shifting incomes to knowledge workers and professionals who are in the upper middle class or in the rest of the top 10 percent. To see how important these assumptions actually are, consider one possible outcome if we had successfully held the top 1 percent’s income share in 2007 to their 1979 level, okay? So assume, for sake of argument, that, that would have reduced economic growth, not by a lot, say, by 8 percent. And assume that the middle 20 percent, instead of receiving 20 percent of the proceeds from this redistribution, got 13 percent of the proceeds. Well, I've done the math, and what it works out to is that in this scenario the middle class actually would be no better off for having limited the increases at the top. So, I think that's against our intuition. But it's, nevertheless, the case. So, as you listen to the arguments from the other side, I hope you continue to ask yourself, as I have, that if income inequality hurts opportunity, why is it so hard to find that link when you look across time and look over space? The answer is that the motion on the table that Income inequality impairs the American dream of upward mobility, is intuitive but wrong. And that's why you should vote against it. Thank you."

    "data": "Let me start tonight by sharing some IRS data. In 1980, the top 1 percent of Americans shared 8.46 percent of national income. By 2007, it had risen to 22.86 percent. During the same time, the bottom 50 percent of Americans' share of national income fell from 17.68 percent to 12.19. During the same period, the income share of the top 1/10th of 1 percent of Americans rose to 12 percent, equaling the share of the bottom 50 percent of Americans combined. And then in 2008  remember, 2007, before, those were the good old days  things went really bad for the American middle class. The distance an American child needs to go to get from the bottom to the top in our society is staggering. CEOs used to make 30 times the median wage now earn 300 to 500 times. If the IRS data that I just quoted you is not persuasive to you, does not persuade you that the distance from the top to the bottom is larger  perhaps 10 times larger, then almost nothing Elise and I can say tonight will persuade you. According to Scott, this economic inequality and its impact on mobility is a fiction. The anguish felt by millions of ordinary working middle class Americans is a consequence of a misconception. They are simply confused about the data. Perhaps. But there are two fundamentally different arguments inequality deniers make. The first is that it doesn't exist. The second is that it exists but it's actually really, really good for the economy and the middle class. This argument is equally false, but at least it seems plausible. The idea, of course, is that when the rich get richer, that's good for the economy and for the middle class, and for mobility. And anything we do to make the poor richer by definition harms the economy and mobility. And this, of course, is the trickledown economics lie. But Ed  Ed and I do agree on one thing, and that is that innovation is essential to a growing economy and that capitalism needs some inequality to create incentives for people to innovate and to take risk. The question for the house tonight is, is extreme inequality necessary, and should we have more and more of it every year? Capitalism needs inequality to grow, just like plants need water to grow. But in precisely the same way that too much water kills plants by drowning them, too much income inequality kills capitalism by drowning the middle class. Raging inequality is drowning the middle class and killing the American Dream of upward mobility. Ed and other inequality apologists present us with a false choice  extreme and rising inequality is necessary to create adequate incentives for innovation and risktaking, and that without these extreme incentives, it will all disappear. He will tell you that anything we do to blunt inequality, like raising the taxes on the rich or improving labor standards for the poor, to increase wages  will kill the economy and mobility. This is utter nonsense. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Sam Walton  they all started their companies when taxes were twice as high as they are today. Theoretically, with half the incentive. Did they make some sort of cosmic mistake? Almost two years ago, taxes on capital gains went up 25 percent, theoretically quartering the incentive. But from where I sit as a technology venture capitalist on the West Coast, the rate of innovation is increasing, not decreasing. Silicon Valley is more on fire, not less. The stock market, since then, has gone from 12,000 to almost 17,000. Clearly, people are responding to incentives, just not the ones Ed thinks. The biggest incentive in a market economy is the market size. And the more money most people have  in other words, the less inequality we have  the bigger the opportunity and the bigger the incentives are to invest and innovate. Ed will tell you that the American economy has outperformed all others because of our extreme inequality. If you are a partner at Bain or someone like me, that feels like it could be true, but it is not on a per capita basis. Our economy has performed roughly the same, on a growth basis, as most other industrial countries. 1.7 to 1.9 percent. The difference, of course, is what life is like for the typical family. Thirty years ago, the American middle class was undisputedly the most prosperous and mobile of any society. Today, that is not true. Today, by every measure, the  the Canadian middle class is more prosperous than ours. Ed and his trickle down ilk believe that capital is all that matters, but we are awash in capital. American companies are currently sitting on $2 trillion worth of cash. At the same time, the cost to innovate has fallen exponentially. It took a million dollars to start Amazon.com. In our economy, growth is dependent on how many innovators and consumers we include in the economy. The economy isn't the bank accounts of the rich. It is the dynamic feedback loop between sellers and buyers. This means that the more people we include in our economy as robust innovators and affluent consumers, the faster it grows and the bigger it gets. But clearly and most obviously, high and growing rates of inequality don't help that. They hinder it by excluding more and more people as sellers and buyers. And at the end of the day, that's why rising inequality is terrible for the economy and for the American Dream of upward mobility. When people are excluded by inequality, it destroys innovation. It destroys consumption. And it destroys mobility. Rising inequality is literally drowning the middle class and killing the American Dream of upward mobility. Thank you."

    "data": "I almost feel like I don't have to speak. Nick said it all for me. But Nick pushes you off what this debate is really about. It's whether income inequality impairs mobility. And if it did, there'd be telltale signs that Nick wants to overlook. The first is that we've seen a lot of growing inequality. But all the evidence says mobility has not declined. We’ve transferred more to the poor. That should increase mobility. It hasn't. Economies with more equally distributed incomes should have more mobility. They don't. We've spent more on education. That should significantly increase our test scores. Okay. So we may not have found a way to increase mobility, but we have found a way to increase the living standards of the poor, and that's by growing our economy. So this debate really isn't about whether income inequality impairs mobility. Even Emmanuel Saez of the liberal PikettySaez duo admits that the chances of a lowincome child reaching any higher level of income has increased. The rungs have gotten wider. You can still climb the rungs even though they're wild  wider. This debate is really about whether the success of America's top earners hurts the middle and working class. Now, our opponents see the pie, the economy as a pie to be divided. They believe that Steve Jobs' success reduces the income of everybody else. The more he gets, the less everybody else gets. We see his success as growing the economy and the demand for labor. Now, it's true, productivity's grown faster than median wages. Our opponents see this as evidence that lesser skilled employees no longer share in the success of our economy. They overlook the fact that growth can manifest itself in two ways: Where the supply of labor is restricted like it was in the 1950s and '60s, it'll drive up wages. But where the supply of labor is unrestricted like it is today, it'll drive up employment. The baby boom, the increased participation of women in the work force, immigration and growing trade deficits have created an enormous increase in supply in labor. And as a result, employment grew instead of wages. U.S. employment has grown 50 percent since 1980, twice as fast as Germany and France, three times faster than Japan. Two to three times faster is an unheard of difference in performance. This difference has been even greater  it would have been  it was even greater because the other countries have shared in the disproportionate benefit of American innovation. And America has achieved this employment growth at median incomes that are 20 to 30 percent higher than Germany, France, and Japan. Because of this growth, today, America's home to 37 million adult immigrants. There are 16 million nativeborn children, and all the children of those 53 million adults. So perhaps wages would have grown faster in the supply of labor had been more restricted. But it's disingenuous to close one eye, ignore America's extraordinary employment growth relative to its peers, and claim that income inequality hurts the middle and the working class. No other economy has done more to help the middle class and working poor than the U.S. economy. And that's why you should vote against the motion that income inequality impairs the American dream of upward mobility. To persuade you that the success of America's top earners subtracts from everyone else's income, our opponents will claim that successful Americans use cronyism to misappropriate their earnings. If these Americans had misallocated the amount of resources that are necessary to achieve their success, growth would have slowed relative to other economies with more equally distributed income. The opposite occurred. America's growth accelerated relative to its peers. Rising cronyism can't explain the faster growth of the United States. And that's not to say there isn't cronyism. There is. But the status quo is under assault from innovation more than it's ever been. The turnover of CEOs, Fortune 500 companies, and Forbes 400 wealthiest Americans have all accelerated. That's a far cry from crony capitalism. And it wasn't crony capitalism that produced America's success. It was hard work and entrepreneurial risk taking. Nick's right. Information technology made our knowledge workers more productive, and it opened up a large window of low cost investment opportunities. And this increased the productivity and pay of our most talented workers and gave rise to a growing number of successful entrepreneurs. Americans were uniquely successful at capitalizing on these opportunities. Their growth didn't hurt America. It made us stronger. So, to avoid debating the truth, Nick went down this path. Our opponents will retreat to a more ambiguous claim, that perhaps we could have raised living standards even more if we'd attack success more heavily. Even if that's true, upward mobility has not been impaired. And therefore you should vote against the motion. And even if you believe that higher taxes distribute more income to the middle class than they destroy, you should at least recognize that there's very little evidence supporting this highly speculative claim. In the real world, Germany, France, and Japan all distributed income more equally, and none of them produced faster employment growth than America, nor, despite more restricted supplies of labor, did they grow their median incomes faster than the United States since the early 1990s. In the academic world, there have been no less than six highly regarded cross country studies on the effect of income inequality on growth, by economists at Harvard, MIT, the OECD, the World Bank, the IMF. All of them have reached the same conclusion: Inequality accelerates growth in highwage economies. The IMF's most recent study, whose headlines insisted that redistribution does not slow growth, admitted, redistribution above the 75 percentile is indeed harmful to growth as the Okun Big Tradeoff suggests. Guess which country's at the 75th percentile? The United States. Another of these studies also conditions the Okun Big Tradeoff and found that by 2001, the growthpromoting effects of inequality had pushed the income of the bottom 90 percent above what it would have been if their share of income hadn't fallen. So even if this briefly stated evidence fails to persuade you, it doesn't mean that the success of our top earners hurts America. Quite the contrary. Not only has America's much faster growth created employment for tens of millions of additional workers at much higher median wages than other – and median incomes  than other highwage economies, it has improved every capable child's chances of earning a higher standard of living. Even Emmanuel Saez agrees. So, please, don't succumb to our opponents’ divisive politics. Even if you support higher taxes, the success of America's top earners is an asset, not a liability. Vote against the motion that success impairs upward mobility."

    "data": "Thank you, John. I'm honored to be here tonight to discuss the mass collection of Americans' phone records. But before I get into the program, I think it's critical to recognize that tonight's debate is not just about phone records and is not just about the NSA. This is a debate about the kind of society we want to live in. Do we want to live in a country in which our government routinely spies on hundreds of millions of Americans who have done nothing wrong? Or do we prefer to live in a country that's true to our vision, to the vision of our nation's founders, who believe that the government should, as a general matter, leave us alone unless it has cause to invade our privacy? I think our founders got it right, and I hope you'll agree, which is why you should vote for the resolution, mass collection of our phone records violates the fourth amendment. Here is what it looks like to live in a society of mass surveillance. Every time you place or receive a call the government knows who you talked to, when the call started and how long it lasted. The government knows every time you called your doctor and which doctor you called, which family members you stay in touch with and which you don't, and which pastor, rabbi or imam you talked to and for how long you spoke. The government knows whether, how often and precisely when you called the abortion clinic, the local Alcoholics Anonymous, your psychiatrist, your exboyfriend, a criminal defense attorney or the suicide hotline. If you called someone today, by tomorrow morning, the government will have a record of that call. It will keep that record for the next five years. And it is doing the same for every one of your calls and every one of the calls of millions of other innocent Americans. This program is the most sweeping surveillance operation ever undertaken in the United States. And it is unconstitutional for the simple reason that the Fourth Amendment does not allow dragnet surveillance. As my partner, Elizabeth, will explain in a few minutes, dragnet surveillance in fact was the principal evil that the Fourth Amendment was designed to prevent, and for good reason. Dragnet surveillance intrudes on the most fundamental of liberties in a free and democratic society: to be left alone by our government, absent good cause. The phone records program breaks that promise. It places the entire country under surveillance without any suspicion. It threatens our ability to communicate freely without having to worry that the government is looking over our shoulders. It discourages journalists’ sources from coming forward, knowing as they now do that every  every one of their calls is being documented in a government database. And it causes ordinary Americans to hesitate before calling individuals or organizations that they would rather not have as a part of their permanent record on file with the NSA. Now, our opponents will attempt to minimize the NSA program's intrusiveness and exaggerate its effectiveness. They'll argue that the Fourth Amendment does not protect our phone records, that there are protections in place for our privacy under the program and that the program is necessary for our national security. All of those arguments are wrong. First, our phone records, especially when they're collected in bulk, are extraordinarily sensitive. They reveal all of your associations, personal, professional, medical, all of them. In fact, your phone records can be every bit as sensitive as the content of your phone calls. If you call someone other than your spouse routinely at 1:00 in the morning, you don't have to know what's said in order to know what's going on. And if a government employee calls a reporter a dozen times before news breaks of an illegal government operation, again, the call pattern tells the story. Our phone records are, in other words, a proxy for the content of our calls. Our opponents will say that the Supreme Court has already decided that phone records are not protected by the Constitution. This argument is based on a Supreme Court case from 1979 called Smith vs. Maryland. But that case involved collection for several days of an individual criminal suspect's phone records. The NSA's program, in contrast, involves the indefinite surveillance of millions of innocent Americans. Our opponents will say that these differences don't matter. But it's truly bizarre to define the boundaries of privacy in the digital age on the basis of a legal opinion issued before the internet as we know it was created, an opinion that many Supreme Court justices have already said is ill suited to the digital era. Second, the privacy protections that our opponents will focus on are a red herring. Those restrictions are weak. They can be violated, and they already have been thousands of times. But more importantly, under our opponents' theory, the Constitution simply does not apply to our phone records. This means that the government could collect them without any of the supposed privacy protections that they will describe. Another fatal flaw in this argument is that the government's collection of our phone records violates our privacy even if there are restrictions in place for their later use. The collection itself is a violation. For that reason, we don't let the NSA keep a copy of every single email sent in the country so long as there are protections in place on the back end. And we don't allow the NSA to put a video camera in our bedrooms so long as it promises not to press play unless it has a good enough reason. Third, bulk collection has not made us any safer. Virtually every independent review of the NSA's phone records program has concluded that it hadn't stopped any terrorist attacks and that the government can track down terrorists without bulk collection by issuing targeted requests to the phone companies. A congressional review group said this: That after studying the NSA's classified evidence, it could not, quote, Identify a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the telephone records program made a concrete difference. A separate presidential group came to the same conclusion, and the president himself has now agreed. One final point: Tonight's resolution is focused on phone records. But don't be fooled. The consequences are much, much broader. If the Fourth Amendment permits the bulk collection of our phone records, then it would permit the bulk collection of other similar records. The problem is that virtually everything we do today leaves a digital trail of some sort. Whenever you send an email, visit a website, use your credit card or even just walk around with your phone turned on, you are leaving a rich trail of digital bread crumbs in your wake. The arguments our opponents will make tonight would expose all of that information to routine, bulk collection by the government. That's not the world that our framers envisioned when they drafted the Fourth Amendment, and it's not the world that you should accept. You should vote for the motion, the mass collection of our phone records violates the Fourth Amendment. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. It's really a pleasure to be here for the Intelligence Squared Debate. These are among the most civil and thoughtful public engagements on issues that I'm familiar with in the current world and a world where civility is often in short supply. So, it's a pleasure to be here. But I have to say that while Alex has anticipated some of my arguments, he's left a few things out. The question that we're debating is a question of law. Does the Fourth Amendment  is the Fourth Amendment violated by mass collection of phone records? And what he glided over was the fact that the Supreme Court has decided this. If this were a true and false question on a constitutional law exam and you said, Yes, the Fourth Amendment is violated by that, you'd get a D because the Supreme Court has decided that these are records that are not protected by the Fourth Amendment because of what Ben Franklin said, If you give away your secrets, they're not yours anymore. Other people get a say in them, and it's not a search when those people make those secrets available. So, that is the state of the doctrine. What Alex said is essentially he doesn't like it, he wants you not to like it. But it is the Supreme Court's law ruling. And of the 20 judges that have been asked to evaluate the argument that Alex made that somehow the passage of time and the adoption of the Internet means that this case is no longer applicable to a mass collection of data, 20 judges have looked at that and 19 of them have rejected Alex's argument. He's got one judge who said, Yeah, I would just as soon overrule the Supreme Court. But district court judges don't ordinarily get to do that. So, the answer to the question I think, and what I hope you will ultimately decide, is that the Fourth Amendment is not violated by this. But there's a second aspect of this that I do want to get to, which is you're probably asking, Yeah, but can that be  really be the right result? And I want to address that because in the end, if you decide  even if you decide that taking these records is an event that implicates a reasonable expectation of privacy, the question is Is it reasonable for the government to have done what they did? And for that I think we ought to address the question of why the government did this. The biggest terrorist threat we face is some terrorist group, well organized, wellarmed, with a safe haven that  where they can bring people with clean passports together, recruit them, train them, finance them, and then send them into the United States to carry out a coordinated attack without any warning, it's almost impossible for us to catch those plots as they're being trained if there truly is a safe haven. So, our best hope for catching those plotters is that they will have to coordinate, probably by phone, inside the United States and perhaps with their trainers and recruiters back in the Middle East. And if we can catch those calls back to the Middle East and then tie them up to the calls that, that person has made inside the United States, we have at least a fighting chance to roll up that attack before it occurs. That's what happened in 9/11. We missed that opportunity. And that's what this program was designed to deal with. They can't, however, pursue the idea that Alex has been offering: go to each of the phone companies and say, Do you have anybody who called these numbers? Give every phone company in America a list of the most sensitive targets, all the terrorist numbers we know in the world, and make sure that they hold those in confidence. Very difficult to do, and then once you try to find somebody in the United States by matching up their calls, once you get past the first hop to the first person, and you're looking to see whether he had sensitive conversations, you're going back to every phone company in America and asking them about those calls. This is a nightmare. The only way you can actually do this as fast as the terrorists can carry out their plot is if you have them in one place where you can search them. And that is what the government tried to do. They put them in one place so that they could search them. That's a collection. Alex says that fact alone made it unconstitutional and that we're somehow  NSA knows when you call your girlfriend at 1:00 in the morning. But the fact is it does us no great harm if all that record is sitting on a hard drive in a safe somewhere and nobody has actually opened up those records to look at. And that's what the government did. They put the protections for privacy not on the collection but on the question of What are we going to search? And they said, you can't search without a good reason for searching, a reasonable, articulable suspicion, limited people who can do it, lots of audits, no number  no names in this database, only numbers  and the number of searches that were performed on an annual basis was about 300. Out of that, they found some suspicious patterns. And they referred those  about 500 a year  to the FBI to find out who these people are and what they're doing. That's the extent of the government's intrusion into privacy, at a time when about a million records are gathered under criminal subpoena. So, we have a choice. We can either say, No, the government can never do that because it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment, or we can say, We want to allow that to happen, but with privacy safeguards. I think the choice, especially at a time when suddenly we have a terrorist group that does have a safe haven, the choice is to choose privacy and security. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you so much. Thank you so much, John. It's great to be here tonight. Now, Stewart certainly presents a frightening picture of terrorists working here in the United States. But he presents a false choice between the idea of securing our nation and remaining faithful to the fundamental values that our nation holds dear, as expressed in the Constitution and, relevant to tonight, the Fourth Amendment. We can do both. As my partner Alex has ably explained, the NSA has not established that its massive intrusion into the lives of everyday Americans is necessary in order to keep us safe. But while this dragnet surveillance program has not been established as necessary, the importance of protecting against such suspicionless, sweeping searches, as those conducted by the NSA, is established in our Constitutional tradition beyond question. Intrusive searches like the one being conducted every day by the NSA strikes at the very core of what the Fourth Amendment was enacted to prevent. It gets to the very heart of why our nation's founders were willing to lay down their lives if they had to in order to protect the liberty, security, and personal privacy of Americans. So, as you listen to our debate tonight, I would ask you to keep in mind the vision and the values of our founders. The reasons why they wrote into our Constitution the Fourth Amendment in the first place  keep that as your North Star tonight. When the founding fathers drafted the Fourth Amendment, the mischief to which they were responding was principally the British use of general warrants and writs of assistance. Broadly authorized searches that allowed British officers to go into the homes of American colonists without any particularized suspicion of wrongdoing. And they were used broadly in the hope that if they went through enough people's stuff, they would find something that would show evidence of wrongdoing. Now, that sounds a little familiar to me today. These generalized searches back then were decried as instruments of arbitrary power. They were used to silence critics of the crown and to trample the personal liberty of the American colonists. In fact, American colonists' opposition to these sorts of generalized searches was, as Chief Justice Roberts explained in a recent Supreme Court decision on behalf of all nine justices on the court, applying robust Fourth Amendment protections to the searches of cell phones, the opposition to these sorts of warrantless, generalized searches was one of the driving forces behind the Revolution itself. To illustrate, the Chief Justice recounted a famous speech given in 1760s Boston by the patriot James Otis, denouncing the use of warrantless searches, generalized searches without individualized suspicion, that invaded American colonists’ privacy without probable cause. One young man listening in the audience that day was none other than John Adams. And recounting Otis's speech and the day, Adams described it later as, the first scene of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then and there the child independence was born. The need to get a warrant to have reasonable suspicion before invading someone's privacy, that wasn't a mere technicality, something on a checklist that you have to go through that slows down good law enforcement, something that the guys on Law and Order sort of get past with a wink and a nod. It was something that was so important to our founders that it was an essential part of the struggle for independence. We are no longer in that first act of the great American story, and we are fortunate that we have to guide us today the wisdom and the words of the Constitution. James Otis in the 1760s didn't have the Fourth Amendment to back up his arguments, but fortunately, Alex and I do tonight. The text of the Fourth Amendment, which you've seen on the screens, declares the right of the people to be free from unreasonable searches. And it tells the government that it needs to have probable cause before it wants to invade our privacy. The detailed text enshrines a specific prohibition, something that's rather unusual in the Constitution, which often speaks in broader terms, a specific prohibition against the types of suspicionless searches that the NSA is conducting every day on Americans  sweeping searches and surveillance of very private information without any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. And the wisdom of our founders applies just as much today as it did in the 18th century. I think those framer guys still have a lot to tell us about what kind of society we want to live in, as Alex said. Just because the sensitive private information that we hold  that we hold dear today can be gleaned remotely and electronically rather than having a British red coat break the padlock on our leather trunk and our cute brick colonial in Boston, as Chief Justice Roberts said, that does not make that information any less worthy of the protection that the founders fought for. Now, the other side will try to say that there isn’t a search or there is some exception that makes it reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. But I would submit that any exception to the Fourth Amendment that allows the government to collect data that can reveal sensitive, deeply private information about every American citizen without any suspicion that we are engaged in real wrongdoing. Any exception to the amendment that allows that would swallow this most important protection in the Constitution, something that was so important to our founders that it breathed a spark to the fire of revolution. So, if you keep as your north star those founders, I trust that you will vote for the proposition that mass collection of Americans' private records violates the Fourth Amendment. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you very much for that invitation. And it's a real pleasure to return to National Constitution Center. I'd like to thank Jeff Rosen, an old college and law school friend of mine and now the president of this wonderful center, and our worthy opponents, who have the misfortune of not being from our great home city of Philadelphia and so are destined to lose; and my coarguer, Stewart Baker, and also the Rosenkranz's family I've known for quite some time. It's a real pleasure to be here under their support. None of that comes out of my time for the debate. So  and I still want to say, it's very likely that I personally be the worst debater because I'm used to sitting in a faculty lounge and not speaking within a sixminute window. In my classes, it takes about six minutes for me to figure out what cases are being covered in the class that I'm certainly standing in. So, I apologize if I don't get to all my points. And I don't  as I'm amazed, my colleagues all did finish exactly at 00:00. I was quite impressed. But I want to make just make two important points  three important points. See, I already started. One, from the  what you heard from the other side, you would think that the government was just interested in collecting information about all of us because they're just interested in collecting information about all of us. The most important point is that there's a reason why the government created these programs. It's the one that was present when I was in the government on 9/11 itself and the reason I was  one of the first things I had to do in the Justice Department was to pass on the legality of what became the surveillance programs. And the reason why is that if you look at the text of the Fourth Amendment, it says we have a right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Much of what Ms. Wydra had to say was about British general warrants and when you get a warrant from a judge, they conduct a search of our houses. I think that's an entirely different question than when the government can institute a broad program that doesn't look at the content of our communications, just looks at the addressing information and the phone numbers and whether it can do that, whether it's a reasonable search given the circumstances. That's how the Supreme Court’s interpreted the language, and that's how we should. And those reasonable circumstances, it seems to me, as my copanelists argued, on 9/11, we were attacked by a different kind of enemy, not a foreign country, but an enemy that hides and disguises itself as normal civilians, that communicates using normal civilian communication methods like the internet and phone calls to launch surprise attacks with devastating effect on our cities, with a goal of killing as many civilians as possible. After 9/11, confronted by this problem, this challenge, we decided this would be a reasonable thing to do to try to find any more terrorists coming to the United States by looking at phone numbers of people from abroad calling into the United States and what those phone numbers called, to try to detect patterns of enemy agents trying to infiltrate into the United States. That's the purpose of the program. And I vigorously deny any idea that this is just part of some government dragnet because the government just likes to collect information about all of us just for the fun of it. The government did not do it for that reason, and I was present at that time, and the reason we did it is because we were suffering from the 9/11 attacks. Second point, I want to just point out, I'm sure that our debate opponents are not often compared to conservatives, but they are as the bed fellows of Robert Bork, because what they have done is said, I don't care what precedence says. I have discerned the principle of the framers, and I am going to impose it over the democratic choices that we have made in our society today. Throw out Smith vs. Maryland, the governing Supreme Court precedent in this area which every lower court judge to examine this program and similar programs has used as a governing law. Throw out the fact that every federal judge to examine these programs at the appellate level and almost all them at district court level have approved this. Throw out that the president has approved it, the Congress has approved it, and the special FISA court made by federal judges has approved it under the Smith vs. Maryland idea. Instead, from the phrases in the Fourth Amendment, I am going to discern this overriding principle that will be imposed on our society. Now, how do they know that the text the Fourth Amendment knows this? We have so many debates in constitutional law. Nick Rosenkranz and Jeff Rosen, who you just heard from in the beginning, they can spend six hours arguing about the meaning of the word the in the Constitution. You probably just saw a little bit of it at the beginning. How do they know that the framers would have disapproved of a collection program that collected phone numbers; didn't listen in on the conversations themselves, but only collected the phone numbers? When people, judges, lawyers who've devoted their lives to trying to figure out what the Constitution means have almost unanimously agreed in their written decisions to approve the constitutionality of this program. So, if anyone's the radicals here, it's the people on the other side, Ms. Wydra, Ms. Abdo  Mr. Abdo, who want to throw out all those decades of cases governing [unintelligible] in favor of their understanding of the Constitution. But suppose you disagree with the Supreme Court, what should you do? Maybe I, as a policy matter, would draw the line between security and privacy somewhere else. We should decide it the way we decide most of the questions in our society. We have elections. If you don't like the line that the government has drawn, elect a president and Congress who would draw it differently. This is not a question, I think, as a democracy, that we should leave up to five  no offense to the retired people in the audience  superannuated elderly people on the Supreme Court, probably don't know how cell phone or smartphone really works; I'm sure have no Facebook or Twitter accounts to let you know about their latest opinions. And so if you really want to change the law here and change what the government does, elect different people to Congress. Elect Rand Paul to president. Put  have them put into effect the policies that we want. But that's how our Constitution is designed to work."

    "data": "Thank you, John. Flexing muscles, that sounds like posturing, doesn't it? And posturing doesn't sound like a very good way to conduct foreign policy. It's not. But, look, we know what this motion is all about. It's about the use of the most salient form of muscle the U.S. has, and that's military force. And so that's what Aaron and I are going to talk about. We're not pacifists. The military instrument has a legitimate role, carefully used in certain times and places. But unless we carefully consider all the costs and risks and limitations and consequences and reactions to our use of military force, it can, and unfortunately very often in the past has, made things worse. Now, Aaron's going to talk later about some of the specific issues we've got facing us in the Middle East. I want to start by talking about how we ought to think about this question. We hear a lot of if only kind of arguments: If only we used force here or used more force, or if only we had used more force or put our troops in here or there, something better would happen. Lots of speculation, lots of counterfactuals. We don't have to dwell just with speculation and counterfactuals. We have a real record out there of having done a lot of application of military force in this region. Data point number one  in fact, there's a whole string of data points  was, of course, the invasion of Iraq, which extended an expedition for another eight and a half years. That made things a lot worse for the United States, considering the trillion dollars of cost and the casualties and everything else. It made things worse for the region because it was a negative example of the so called birth pangs of democracy and because it stimulated the kinds of sectarian conflict and consciousness we see in Syria and elsewhere. And it was certainly bad for Iraq which  where it touched off a civil war that has never ended and also gave rise to various forms of extremism. That group ISIS, or Islamic States, or ISIL, or whatever you want to call it that we're so worried about today, it was born under a different name as a direct response to our invasion of Iraq and the civil war it touched off. ISIL did not exist before we went into Iraq. And to talk about Iraq in the past is not just dwelling in the past, it raises the very issues which Aaron will go into more that we're still facing today. Now, one thing you hear often in the sort of if only category is If only we had somehow kept troops there beyond the eight and a half years, that somehow things would have worked out differently. Now, set aside the question of how that could have been done when we had an Iraqi government that was determined to get us out and the previous administration under Mr. Bush was the one that set the withdrawal deadline. But the fact is we did try to up the ante militarily. We had the socalled surge. You remember that? And it, along with some other factors, like disillusionment with the extremists among IraqiSunni Arabs, temporarily brought down the level of violence. But the surge failed in its more fundamental political objective of providing the space for Iraqi politicians to reach an accommodation and build a new and more stable Iraqi political order. They never did that, and we have the mess that we see today in Iraq. And anyone who thinks otherwise I think has to answer the question: If eight and a half years were not enough, then how many years would be enough? Let me just mention one other thing in the past briefly, because it comes under a different administration: the intervention in Libya. Now, there you already have a civil war going, but we used force to help overthrow Gaddafi, and look at the mess that Libya's in now. About the closest thing we have in the region to it, total anarchy. And I might remind you, whatever you might have thought of the late Mr. Gaddafi, years before any use of force or even threatening the use of force, he got out of the international terrorism business and he gave up his unconventional weapons programs, leaving him as a sort of quaint and curious dictator, but, frankly, not much of a threat to U.S. interests. So, what's going on here? Why do we have these unfortunate results? Well, I think there are several patterns that we've seen again and again. One is military force is good to accomplish a lot of things. It's pretty poor to accomplish a lot of other things. The U.S. military's a great hammer, but some of the thorniest problems we've got in the Middle East simply are not nails. Building political and social order is not primarily a matter of killing people. One's a matter of construction. The other's a matter of destruction. What has mattered again and again in places like Syria and Iraq and Libya and elsewhere is political will and political culture and the will to reach political accommodation. And that can't be injected through the barrel of a gun. Closely related to that is the principle that we need the people in the region and the players in the region to become owners of any solution. If it's just outsiders, whether it's the United States or someone else, then whatever good effect may be brought about, as long as we've got the strength there, like we had 168,000 troops at one point in Iraq, is not going to last, just like the benefits of the surge didn't last. Another thing that's happened when we flexed our muscle in this way in the Middle East is the United States has been taking sides in someone else's internal conflict, which in that part of the world is often defined in sectarian or ethnic terms. And that's no good either. It's an invitation for the other side to get more involved. And for the United States, we have no interest  no national interest  in taking sides in someone's sectarian civil war. And finally, again and again, we see our use of our muscle engendering the reaction of hatred and antiAmericanism and extremism and terrorism, partly because of the inevitable collateral damage, partly because we're who we are, the superpower, hated, because we come in with our boots trampling on someone else's ground. So, again and again, we see the reaction, including when Osama bin Laden was initially radicalized as a result of U.S. troops going into Saudi Arabia, or when ISIS was born after we went into Iraq, or today when ISIS is committing those grisly murders and justifying it by saying it's in response to something we've done. So, the Middle East is a pretty messy place. It can get messier. And to prevent us from making it even messier, we have to ask not what we would hope would happen or wish would happen with the application of military force, but to look at what we've done in the past and how often it has, in fact, made things worse. Thank you."

    "data": "Well thank you, John. It's an honor  and I want to say this with real sincerity  to be debating two very distinguished public servants, each of whom has done a lot for this country. How distinguished, you might ask? So distinguished that they are prepared to take an intellectual bullet tonight  if not for their country, then for this audience  in order to defend an implausible, illogical, and frankly nonsensical proposition that neither of them can possibly believe is true. The proposition we are debating this evening is this: flexing America's muscles in the Middle East will make things worse, by which we mean, intervening militarily. Notice that it falls to Paul and Aaron to defend that statement categorically  no exceptions. They must convince you that, no matter what the circumstance, U.S. military intervention in the Middle East cannot be the answer. But also notice this: Michael and I are not arguing the opposite case. We are not saying, Bomb every time and everything. We are not saying, Whatever the question, war is the answer. This is a caricature position, and all of you in this room are, frankly, too smart for that. Right? What we are saying is that, in the Middle East, as in the world, as in life itself, you take it on a casebycase basis. You look at the circumstances. You distinguish between the preferable and the necessary; the merely important versus the absolutely vital. What we are arguing is not dogma and not absolutism. We are arguing the case for pragmatism. Ladies and gentlemen, ask yourselves this: If you were the president and you were in a position to use force to prevent the massacre by ISIS of the Yazidi people, would you authorize force? Would you do what Barack Obama did? Would you send flights of F18s to relieve the siege of Sinjar mountain? Or would that simply have made things worse? When the other week, tens of thousands of Kurds faced death at the hands of ISIS, would you have used air power, as President Obama did, to help them get to safety? Or would you have left them to their own devices? Would military force in that circumstance make things worse? Ladies and gentlemen, if you had been George H. W. Bush in the spring of 1991 when Saddam Hussein was besieging the Kurds in northern Iraq, would you have launched Operation Provide Comfort to save them? Or did that just make things worse? Now, I know what you're thinking, and I know what they're going to say: These aren't really military interventions. They're quasihumanitarian rescue efforts. But that's not true. When bombs are being dropped, that's not humanitarian work. American fighter pilots are not NGO workers. GPSguided bombs are not care packages. All of this is an example of flexing America's muscles; of using the American military in the service of a good cause. So, the question before you tonight is, are you for it, at least occasionally? Or are you against it in every circumstance? Now, let's take another example: when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in the summer of 1990, and George H. W. Bush said this aggression will not stand. Was he wrong to oppose it? Would the world have been a better place if Saddam had simply swallowed Kuwait whole? Is that the kind of world that you want to live in? Maybe if you're Vladimir Putin, that's the world you would like to live in. But I'm asking you, the audience. Aren't we better off that that aggression was opposed, just as Bill Clinton opposed Serbian aggression in Bosnia and Kosovo? Now, we remember the 1990s as this halcyon period for America, and indeed it was. And it was a great period because the world understood the U.S. was prepared to enforce the rules of international order with force when those rules were flagrantly violated by tinpot dictators with genocidal tendencies. Now, you heard from Paul, and soon you're going to hear from Aaron. And they will tell you, Yes, but what about the intervention in Lebanon in 1983, and how did that turn out? And what about Iraq, as Paul just mentioned, and Afghanistan, and maybe the prospect of bombing Iran in the event that nuclear negotiations go nowhere? Let me make two points about this. Noting that military interventions and wars can go horribly wrong is not an argument in this debate. It is totally beside the point. World War I may have been totally pointless, but World War II was not pointless. Like everything in life, there are just wars and unjust wars, smart wars and dumb wars, smart wars that are badly executed and dumb wars that are well executed. And the second point is this: Telling us that actions have consequences, particularly unintended consequences, tells us nothing about the consequences of inaction, because what we are seeing today, contrary to what Paul just mentioned, in the Middle East  the near collapse of the Iraqi government; mass executions; the fall of cities like Mosul, Tikrit and Fallujah; the vortex in Syria; the progressive radicalization of the Syrian opposition to the point that even alQaeda isn't radical enough; the beheading of journalists; millions of refugees straining the resources of Lebanon and Jordan and Turkey  all this is not the consequence of flexing America's muscles. It is a consequence of a presidential decision in the last four years not to flex those muscles. Each of us, in our everyday lives, know that every action carries risks, but there is also a price to be paid when we do nothing, when you don't make the phone call, when you don't challenge your colleague, when you don't make the move to another job. Foreign policy is not that different. Ladies and gentlemen, it would be nice to live in a world where the best policy is to do nothing, to look away, to always choose the peaceful route, to offer kindness and get kindness in return, to always take the diplomatic option. But you and I and they don't live in that world. We live in the world as it is, not the one we'd like to pretend it to be. And in that world, as it is, you sometimes need to flex your muscles, prudently, discriminately, effectively, yes. But to choose simply never to exercise those muscles at all is an absurd motion. I urge you to reject it. Thank you."

    "data": "John, thank you very much. It's an honor and privilege to be here. It's an honor to debate Mike and Bret, friendly but formidable opponents, and it's wonderful to be here with Paul Pillar who brings a measure of honesty and clarity to this debate, sometimes controversial, but it is sorely needed. I really do find myself, unfortunately, sadly, paradoxically, in the anomalous position of agreeing with almost everything Bret said. And at the risk of never being invited back to IQ2  I have to say at the outset that this is a national conversation that is simply too important to be constrained and confined to simple propositions. I will defend the proposition, but the nuance is clear. And Bret made the case, and that is to say there is smart muscle flexing  the effective application, formidable application of American military power  and there is dumb muscle flexing. And that anomaly, that inconsistency, has to be reflected not just in the debate but in the actual execution of policy. If the application of American military power had always been smart, we wouldn't be having these conversations, and I'd be applauding Michael and Bret for everything that they've said in their compelling arguments, nor would I have ever agreed to debate and argue for the proposition. But sadly, that has not been the case. Muscle flexing has, on balance, in my judgment, as my inestimable partner, Paul Pillar, has mentioned, it's messy, and it's, for the United States, been on balance a very unhappy enterprise. And it is likely to remain unhappy as well. This is not to say  and I want to repeat this for my own personal credibility and what remains of my professional reputation  The reality is that the application of military power can be effective, can be appropriate. Bush 41, for whom I worked, pushing Saddam out of Kuwait. Go read Baker's memoir of why Bush didn't continue that operation to Baghdad. Read Baker's prescient memoir about the risks, the limitations, and the constraints. Bush 43's application of military power in Afghanistan, air power, local allies, good intel, managed in a manner of months to defeat alQaeda and to decimate the Taliban, at least for the moment. But in recent years, I would argue to you, respectfully and humbly, we have not been nearly as effective as in years past. In fact, I would argue that the U.S. is like some modernday Gulliver, wandering around in a part of the world that it does not understand, constrained by its own illusions, by smaller powers whose interests are not its own all the time. And in search of Hollywood endings to a region that is broken, angry, and dysfunctional, and offers up not solutions and definitive outcomes at all, but just outcomes. And do not let our debating opponents try to persuade you that this is a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. I worked for Rs and Ds. I voted for Rs and Ds. And I can tell you, with some authority, that muscle flexing, dumb muscle flexing, is a bipartisan  as well as equal opportunity employer. Twain quipped, and he was right, famously, that history does not repeat  it does not repeat. History rhymes. And it's the rhythmic patterns that you need to pay attention to when it comes to smart application of American military power. Let me identify four, perhaps five, cautionary tales with respect to why you need to support our rendition of this emotion  of this motion. Number one: There is muscle flexing as overreach. Paul has referred to Iraq, what I call  not to trivialize the men and women who served, who died, and who suffered lifecrippling injuries from which they will never, ever recover. This turned out to be, in my judgment, with all due respect, a trillion dollar social science experiment that fundamentally failed. It caused 6,000 Americans dead, trillions expended, most of our credibility in tatters. And for what? A standard of victory was not, could we win, but when could we leave? And extrication is not a metric that you want to use to judge the performance of the most consequential power on earth. That's muscle flexing as overreach. Then you have muscle flexing as bluster. That is to say, talk without action. And I would argue, even though I have supported the president's willful refusal to militarize the American role in Syria in order to defeat Assad  ISIS is a different story now  that was an example of talk without action. That is dumb muscle flexing because it erodes and undermines credibility. Presidential rhetoric has to be rooted in reality. If you say it, you've got to mean it, and you have to follow through. Then we have what I call oneoff muscle flexing. That's Libya. That's where we and NATO took eight months to take care of Colonel Q, but without much regard or thought to the implications of what would come next. And we lost the first sitting ambassador since 1979, Chris Stevens, as a consequence. Fourth, there is splitthedifference muscle flexing. I support the president's strategy in Syria, but it is replete with anomalies and contradiction that are going to be extremely difficult to maintain. We strike ISIS, we essentially empower Assad. We try to take out Assad, we leave the field open to ISIS. Caliphates in Damascus, with Baghdad next. And fifth  and this is why this is deadly serious. What is happening tonight, this conversation is not some sort of academic exercise. The mother of all military interventions may be not far away. If negotiations do not produce a comprehensive accord, if sanctions do not work with respect to the mullahs in Tehran, if the mullahs accelerate their program, this president has set his own red line. He will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. We have committed ourselves to the Israelis repeatedly over the last several years not to preempt, we will do it for them. So I urge you when you vote, think about the consequences and implications, both for and against, of the application of military power. Let me conclude by simply saying neither this administration that has been risk averse or the last one that has been too risk ready has got it right. The next time we apply military force, we need to think through how, why, and where."

    "data": "Thank you, John. And thank all of you for coming. It's a great pleasure to be here. It's an honor. It truly is an honor to be debating Aaron and Paul and to be on the same team with somebody as talented and silver tongued as Bret Stephens. Handsome, silver tongued, and talented. I thought that what Aaron just said was very wise and very gracious. I noted, as you did, that he accepted our victory. He agreed with everything that Bret said. And so I would very graciously like, in complete reciprocity and the spirit of reciprocity, I accept your admission of defeat. And I accept your challenge to discuss this in terms other than the motion. Look, it's true that we have to have wise use of force as opposed to dumb use of force. I think we can all agree to that. If we're going to say though, as I think Paul and Aaron are, that we need to have a kind of bias in favor of restraint, then you're saying one of two things. You're saying that action is either going to  military action is either going to destroy some beneficial process that is ongoing, or you're saying that it is going to generate some new bad process that doesn't exist. And I think that, that proposition, the proposition basically that Paul laid out, is the one that President Obama accepted when he took office in 2009 and he made policy toward the Middle East  from 2009 up until yesterday or a couple of weeks ago  on the basis that restraint is almost always better than the use of military action. And I look at the last five years as a kind of referendum on that proposition, and I think it comes up, and it comes up faulty. And I'd like to explain to you why. So, what did we see over the last five years? We saw, first of all, in Iraq, we saw the Maliki government become increasingly sectarian, increasingly dependent on Iraq, and increasingly dictatorial. And it alienated the Sunni Arabs living in alAnbar Province and in the north. Now, Paul said that the surge did not stop the civil war, it just lowered the violence a little bit. It's not true. It's not true. The surge created a political space that Maliki could have used to have created a more inclusive government. It needed, though  that process needed continued American pressure, which the Obama administration would not apply. And so David Petraeus handed to the Obama administration and he handed to Maliki an opportunity that was lost. Now, that's what was happening in Iraq, so the civil war started up again in a vicious sectarian fashion, alienated the Sunnis. Meanwhile in Syria another civil war started, which had nothing to do whatsoever with the application of American force. It started completely as a result of indigenous processes. But there, too, we have a sectarian Shiite government aligned with Iran that is destroying Sunnis. Now, think about the extent of the destruction in Syria. Syria's a country of around 20 million people. Nine million of them, possibly even 10 million of them are now displaced. That's almost half the entire population of the country has been displaced. Three million of them have been driven out of Syria and are now refugees in the surrounding countries and risking to destabilize those countries. Let's not even mention the systematic rape, the torture, the dropping of bombs onto breadlines as women and children wait to buy bread, by the Assad regime and supported by Iran. So, if you want to say that using military force is going to stop some kind of beneficial process that is ongoing, you can't make the argument, because if you look at what's happening, the Middle East is spiraling out of control. And that's why President Obama finally had to apply force, because there was this process spiraling out at full force. Now, back in 2012, his National Security Council went to him and said, You have to apply force. You have to arm the Syrian opposition. This was David Patraeus, Hillary Clinton, Leon Panetta, and so forth. And President Obama said, No, I won't do it. Now, at the same time that this argument was going on, Sarah Palin was asked what she thought about this. Sarah Palin  the war was going on and she was asked, Should we arm the Syrian opposition like the National Security Council wants to? And she said, No. She said, My answer is, let Allah sort them out, right? Let the Sunnis and Shiites kill each other. Now, that is basically the policy that President Obama followed. He didn't call it that, but that's what he did. He let Allah sort it out. That is the policy that Paul Pillar and Aaron David Miller are calling for. They're saying, Let Allah sort it out  the Sarah Palin Doctrine. We know  We now know that the Sarah Palin strategy does not work. It does not work. We have to use military power. And we have to use military power. Now, Paul Pillar said something interesting. He said, You cannot  you can't make people increase their will by use of military force. This is patently not true. The fact of the matter is that what we have in the Middle East are countries run by mafias, basically, or organizations like ISIS that are first and foremost mafia organizations. If somebody goes to the United States and beheads its citizens on television and the United States says, I'm not going to do anything, it sends a message to all of our allies in the region that if we're not going to go take action when our citizens are beheaded, we're certainly not going to come help them. And that encourages them to go and cut a deal with the mafia rather than showing the will to fight. If we don't put skin in the game  and skin in the game means military force  then we will not  then we will undermine the will of our allies whom we need. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you very much. It's a real honor to be here. I was just surprised  I just saw Rick press the undecided button. So, that was interesting. We'll see how that goes. It is such an honor to be here today. Let me tell you a little bit about what our game plan is, that   Carmel and I. We've been together all afternoon, we've been scheming about this. I will start by talking about what it means to embrace the Common Core. Then I will talk about some of the problems in our education system and frankly in previous waves of reform that the Common Core is trying to address. Carmel then is going to talk about the process of developing the Common Core, the role that educators play, the role that evidence played, as well as talk about some of the equity issues that are at stake here, how the Common Core can help to narrow the achievement gap. Now, what you won't hear us argue is, first of all, that Common Core is going to solve all of our nation's educational problems because, of course, it won't. You're not going to hear us say that the Common Core are perfect. They were not handed down from Mount Sinai, they are not set in stone, right, or we're going to hear plenty of concerns about this individual standard or that individual standard, so you won't hear us say that they're perfect. And you're not going to hear us say that it's all going perfectly out there around the country, because, of course, it's not all going perfectly out there around the country. This is a big country, 50 million kids in public schools, 100,000 of those schools, and like any ambitious reform, it's a work in progress, okay? But what you are going to hear us argue is that despite all of that you should still embrace the Common Core. Now, why is that? Why should you embrace the Common Core? And what does that mean? In our view, to embrace the Common Core is, first of all, to embrace the idea that our schools should have standards, all right, that doesn't sound so radical, and that the standards that we have should be set at a high enough level to indicate that our students are ready for what comes next. And that means kids graduating from high school, that they're either ready to go and succeed in college or to go and get a good paying job. Now, what you might have to understand is that this is a radical departure from how we used to do this. States did have standards before the Common Core, but, by and large, they were set at a very, very low level. And so what that meant is that students could meet those standards, they could pass the standardized tests connected to those standards, but it didn't mean that they were ready for success later on. In fact, in many states it didn't even mean that they were at grade level. And so we had a system that was giving a lot of false information out there to students, to teachers, to parents alike. So, to embrace the Common Core is to say, Let's embrace standards that are set at this college and career ready level. It's also to say that we should embrace the idea of moving to next generation assessments, right, tests that measure these standards, that are worlds better than the tests that we've been living with for the past two decades. Many of us in this room as parents or as teachers, we know that there has been this huge focus on standardized testing in this country. And unfortunately, by and large, those tests have been terrible, fill in the blank, multiple choice tests, tests that don't do a good job measuring what students know and that encourage very low level kind of teaching and learning in the classroom. But now, after four years, we're finally getting to the point where there are new assessments coming connected to the Common Core that are going to be much more like advanced placement exams or international baccalaureate exams like the ones that Carol uses in her school, and this is our chance to move to those assessments. So, if you embrace the Common Core, its high standards, its next generation assessments, that's what we are moving towards. Now, what's the problem we're trying to address? Every study that's ever been done on American education comes to pretty much the same conclusion. It's not that our schools are failing, though some are failing, but on the large, it's not that schools are failing, it's that our schools, by and large, are mediocre when compared to schools overseas. They're in the middle of the pack. They're not the best schools in the world, they're not the worst schools in the world. They're in the middle of the pack. And it's not just our demographics. It's not just because we have a lot of childhood poverty, though we do. Our rich kids are in the middle of the pack compared to other rich kids around the world, poor kids, middle class kids, high achievers, low achievers. Throughout the education system, it's this concern around mediocrity. And we've known this for 30 years. And we have been working hard at trying to address that. And we've made some progress, right? Poor and minority and low achieving kids today are reading and doing math two to three grade levels ahead of where they were back in the 1990s. That's incredible progress. And our public education system deserves credit for making that progress. And almost certainly it was because back in the '90s and 2000s, states decided to set standards, to have tests that measured those standards, and to have accountability systems to make those standards stick. And it  again, we've made real progress. But because the standards were set so low and because the tests have been so easy, all of the focus has been getting the lowest performing kids over that very low standard, right? And that's led to great progress for the kids at the bottom but it hasn't done much for the kids at the middle or the kids at the top because they were so far ahead of those standards that it didn't get much traction with them. At the same time, it's come along with a lot of unintended consequences, and we know about those, too, teaching to the test, narrowing of the curriculum, driving out a lot of the joy that we want to have in our schools, okay? And again, Carol, Rick, many others have been very eloquent on this point. This is our chance to embrace the Common Core, is to fix all of that, to move to a system with much higher standards but also better tests that give better information but that also encourage better teaching and learning in the classroom. Carmel and I had a chance today to meet with a group of teachers, many of them are here in the room tonight, to tell us how it's going with Common Core. And it's not perfect. There's issues, and there is bumps in the road, but they talked about these higher expectations for their students that some of these kids, they couldn't  you know, four years ago they couldn't believe that the kids could perform at the level that they're performing now, but these higher standards have pushed them in that direction. Now, Rick and Carol are going to say that we should not embrace the Common Core, and I don't know if they're willing to hug the Common Core or kiss the Common Core or fist bump the Common Core, so I'm not  we'll see what their position it, but what do they want? Do they want us to go back to the old standards, the ones that were set way too low, that gave everybody this false impression that everything was fine? Do they want us to stick with the  still the standardized tests, these rinkydink standardized tests that we've lived with for 20 years? Do they want to follow the example of Oklahoma, the one state in the country that has repealed the Common Core and replaced it with something else right away, and in Oklahoma today, today in Oklahoma schools, teachers did not know what standards they were supposed to teach to. They don't know six months from now which tests they're going to be held accountable to, but I guarantee you it's not going to be one of these next generation assessments because there's no time and there's no money for that. It's going to be one of these rinkydink assessments instead. Lots more to talk about throughout this debate, but for all of those reasons, this is why you should vote to Embrace the Common Core. Thank you."

    "data": "Good evening, and thank you for inviting us to this very important debate about the quality of the Common Core standards. I say quality because this isn't a debate about whether or not we need standards. Of course we do. And this isn't a debate about whether or not schools should improve. That's a given. Rather, this is a debate that asks whether or not the Common Core standards are so remarkable and so sound that we should embrace them as the standards by which every American child is both educated and judged. In a little while, Rick is going to explain the flaws in the design of the standards. As a lifelong educator, I'm going to explain the flaws in the standards themselves. Let's begin with kindergarten. Listen while I read this Common Core kindergarten standard. Compose and decompose numbers from 11 to 19 into 10 ones and some further ones. Example, by using objects or drawings and record each composition or decomposition by a drawing or equation. Example, 18 equal 10 plus eight. Understand that these numbers are composed of 10 ones and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or nine ones. Now, I ask you, should that be a standard for a fiveyearold? Or to put it another way, do the standards know and match what we know now about childhood development? Well, in 2010, when the standards were first rolled out, experts said, No. Five hundred early childhood experts, pediatricians, psychologists, researchers, and teachers found the Common Core standards to be so developmentally inappropriate that they called for their suspension in grades K through 3. Back to Louisa Moats, one of the few early childhood experts that were on the team that created the literacy standard, is now one of their most outspoken critics. Why? Because the Common Core standards disregard decades of research on early reading development and instead yank up difficulty levels at every grade. So, how could the developers of the Common Core get it so wrong? The Common Core standards were built backwards from grade 12 down to preK. But kids don't grow backwards, they grow forward, and their development is unique and uneven. The Common Core requiring that kindergarteners count from one to 100 by ones and 10s, even though we know that most five years old can count to 20, is as silly as expecting all twoyearolds to be potty trained. Research did not guide the development of the Common Core standards. And then there is the math. Most of the time, when we think of standards, we think about what topics should be taught at different grade levels. But the Common Core goes beyond and seeks to influence how math should be taught, often in confusing ways. Here’s a first grade example. Use strategies such as counting on, making ten. Example, eight plus six equals eight plus two plus four equal ten plus four equal 14, decomposing the number leading to a 10. Example, 13 minus four equal 13 minus three minus one equal ten minus one equal nine, and creating equivalent but easier or known sums. Example, adding six plus seven, by creating the known equivalent, six plus six plus one equal twelve plus one equal thirteen. Now, when you listen to that, are we surprised that we have created complicated homework problems that comedians joke about and that make children cry? This is why parents and teachers are rebelling. In one year, in the bluest of states, California and New York, the Common Core has moved from majority approval to majority disapproval. In one year, teacher support for the Common Core has dropped 30 points. This is not a Tea Party rebellion. This is a parent rebellion and it’s happening because the Common Core has moved from paper to practice, from the ideal to the real. And then yes, there are the tests. Even as the consortia developed national tests, New York State is giving Common Core tests twice. And guess what, they’re multiple choice tests and they don’t look anything like the IB. Results have been devastating for our special education students, our English language learners, and our students of poverty. And they’re based on arbitrary measures of proficiency. Bad test scores have consequences for kids. Fourteen states require that third graders be left back based on poor reading scores. Kids are put in remedial classes. Test scores decide who gets into gifted programs and into competitive schools. High school graduation rates are expected to plummet. The Carnegie Corporation has predicted that the six year drop out rate will double, from 15 percent to 30 percent. And the four year graduation rate will drop from 75 percent to 53 percent. We already have a preview. The GED test was the line to the Common Core. It dropped 19 points to a passing rate of 53 percent. Here’s the bottom line: There is no evidence, none, that the Common Core standards and its tests will actually increase student learning. And as we engage in this experiment, we may very well hurt the kids who need our support the most. And so I urge you to vote no at the end of this debate, because if we embrace the Common Core, we are embracing a set of flawed standards that will mark as failures more than half of our kids. And your kids and your grandkids deserve better than that. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you John and thanks to Intelligence Squared for bringing this debate here tonight and including me in it. I want to start by telling you the story of Janelle, a young woman from Philadelphia who I spoke to recently. And whose story embodies why I feel so strongly that the Common Core is a crucial step forward for American education. Janelle is an African American woman from the north side of Philadelphia. Her parents believed in the power of education to transform lives. They had one overriding message for their daughter: Do well in school and you will be the first person in the family to go to college. Janelle got the message. She worked hard. She took honors courses. She got all As. She was her vice president of her senior class. And she graduated in the top of her class. She was number three in her class. She diligently applied to college, and she and her parents ecstatically celebrated when she not only got into college, a public fouryear institution in Pennsylvania, but got a full scholarship. But it wasn't very long after going to college before she realized that she had been duped. The As she'd earned in her honors courses in high school seemed to bear little relationship with what it took to succeed in her collegelevel courses. In subject after subject, she struggled, becoming more and more dejected. She explained to me how one of the problems that she encountered was that in high school, her teachers helped her translate her textbooks. But when she got to college, her professors expected her to be able to do that for herself and then analyze the information, as opposed to just understanding it. And her  she didn't have those skills. They hadn't taught them to her in her high school. As a result  as a result, Janelle's GPA dropped and she lost eligibility for her scholarships. Now, the good news is, she did  she has managed to return to college as a sophomore. She was able to fill the gap left by her scholarships with student loans. Many children in her  in her situation would have given up and dropped out. The Common Core is for Janelle and for the thousands of students who are giving it their all but not getting their money's worth. Now, I agree with something Rick has said before, which is that standards are meaningless unless they're translated into effective instruction. As Mike noted, the Common Core is not a silver bullet for all that ails our education system. But it is an essential building block. And for students like Janelle who, for generations, have been shortchanged by the old, failed system, new standards will help ensure they are never left behind again. We know what we were doing before wasn't working. We see remediation rates as high as one in four college students who are not ready for collegelevel material. And that translates, just here in New York, to $80 million in wasted resources that could be spent on other supports for our students to be successful. And that doesn't even address the students like Janelle who are not in remediation, but are struggling with college level content. Some schools, like the one that Carol runs, have adopted International Baccalaureate programs or advanced placement courses to supplement the old state standards, but we can't rely on visionary principles like Carol  or a patchwork of programs to close our nation's gaping achievement gaps or prepare future generations to compete with China. Now, I'd like to cut  clear up a couple misconceptions about the Common Core that had been promoted by the Glenn Becks of the world. First the Common Core was not developed in secret and was not developed by the federal government. This was an initiative led by Democratic Governor Markell of Delaware and Republican Governor Sonny Perdue of Georgia. Back in 2008, virtually all of the governors, with the exception of Rick Perry and Sarah Palin, were strongly supportive of it. Unlike the previous patchwork of standards, the Common Core was developed with significant input from educators and content experts, like the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The authors consulted teacher unions, the civil rights community, college leaders, and business leaders. The standards were revised based on over 10,000 comments from the general public. And contrary to the assertion of the opposition, most teachers are not opposed to the standards, and indeed strongly support them. Now, I appreciate that there has been a great deal of controversy about the way the standards have been implemented and concerns with how test scores are being used in our education system. I think those concerns are real. And we should  we should address them. But  and teachers, when asked about the standards in the context of accountability  particularly accountability for themselves  their own performance  they're hesitant about the standards. But despite these concerns, a Winston poll in early August revealed that two out of three teachers approved of the adoption and believed they are what their students need to be successful. And when implementation is done well, which I strongly believe requires that you use teachers to help you develop an implementation plan  teachers feel excited about the standards and believe they have more, not less, freedom in their classroom. John, a high school geometry teacher, said it better than I could: The old standards gave teachers a set of specific and sometimes constricting direction on where to turn, when to turn, and how fast to go. The Common Core standards instead give us mileposts to aim for, tell us where we should end up but not how to get there. And this was something that Mike and I heard loud and clear this afternoon when we were talking to teachers from right here in New York. Later in the debate, I'm sure we'll talk more about the challenges of implementation and the need for commonsense use of tests. Those are important issues. But because we have challenges doesn't mean that we should turn our backs on the incredible work that's been done over the last four years here in New York and around the country to lay the groundwork for the implementation of these standards. I think there are commonsense ways we can and should make implementation go more smoothly. As Mike said, I think that the Common  new assessments aligned to the Common Core will address one of the chief complaints of teachers and students alike, fill in the bubble tests. Because the Common Core requires children become problem solvers and good communicators, the new tests aligned to them will measure complex thinking, reading, writing, communications, and problem solving kids' skills. As a result, teachers will no longer be driven to narrow the curriculum or teach to a bad test. There have always been standards and always will be standards. There have always been tests and there always will be tests. It's time to get them right. For that reason, I ask you to Embrace the Common Core."

    "data": "It's a pleasure to be here with you this evening to talk about this issue. Notice that we  I am not here to argue that the Common Core is malicious or atrocious. I am here to argue that we should not embrace it. Now, you might wonder why. I heard Mike try to recharacterize the Common Core as meaning that one is for standards, for high standards, and for great tests. Well, if that's the Common Core, then I'm for it, too. But that's actually not the Common Core. That is Mike trying to turn the Common Core into a vague principle that we like good stuff. Carmel talked about Janelle. I got to tell you, if you think there was any state in the Union, circa 2009, that said, It's state standards, or, It's okay to graduate high school as an illiterate, that's actually not the facts on the ground. The standards bear only a passing resemblance to what is asked of kids and what actually gets taught. But that's all kind of a distraction. There's a couple reasons that we should absolutely not embrace the Common Core. First, the Common Core does not solve the problem that it was designed to solve. The motivation behind the launch of the Common Core was what we called the race to the bottom, after No Child Left Behind, the concern that states were playing games with their test scores in order to make their schools look better than they were. Common Core was supposed to help address this. It doesn't. It doesn't because in order to get a lot of states to sign on, partly with the inducement of federal money, the advocates for the Common Core brutally compromised the design of the thing. Common Core allows every state to set its own cut score, so every state can decide what is or is not passing. The Smarter Balanced Consortium, one of the two federally funded testing consortia, gives states a 12week testing window. They can decide where in a 12week period during the spring they would like to test their kids. That means some states can have their kids get 50 percent more learning time than other states. This is a timetested way to inflate your test scores. And only about 35 to 40 percent of students are actually going to be tested in the spring with the federally funded Common Core assessments. Other states have been bailing in droves, and we've now got a slew of states whipping up halfbaked assessments for next spring that certainly aren't comparable and very likely may be lousier tests than the one they abandoned for the Common Core. So the bottom line is that Common Core actually not only doesn't solve the race to the bottom problem, it may actually aggravate it. Second issue going on here is a number of strident claims were made for the Common Core. We are told that the Common Core is evidence based. We are told that it's internationally benchmarked, that it's rigorous. Well, that evidence is about as disciplined as Mike's reference to the   his assertion that every study over 30 years  just no, you can't make statements like this. There are tens of thousands of studies conducted of United States education, and they don't all show anything. The idea that the Common Core is evidence based? Look, what they mean is the folks sitting on the committees that wrote the Common Core looked at some statistics on the kinds of high school courses that college kids take, and they looked at some surveys of employers and college professors. That's fine. That's good. I'm glad they did that. That's not evidence of what needs to be or not be in the Common Core. In fact, I'm not sure what kind of evidence one would point to, to prove that children need to learn to multiply fractions at this grade rather than that grade. Frankly, these are judgment calls which reasonable people can disagree on. Lynn Fuchs, professor at Vanderbilt, who's got no dog in the Common Core fight, has pointed out that there's no empirical basis for the Common Core, that we don't know yet whether it makes sense to have this particular set of standards or not. Internationally benchmarked? What they mean is that people on the committees writing the Common Core looked at some international standards, and they copied some, and they didn't copy others. The idea that the Common Core's more rigorous? Well, frankly, the Common Core ends high school math after algebra 2. Most state standards went beyond that. They included trigonometry and precalculus before the Common Core. Now, Mike and Carmel might say that they don't think that stuff's necessary or useful, but it's hard for somebody to convince me that these are undeniably more rigorous standards when we're jettisoning the last two years of mathematics. Now, this would all be interesting enough and a reason to maybe go slow, but there's another piece to the puzzle, which is that Common Core is actually not just about words on paper. It's also about theories of hypotheses about how kids will learn better. These hypotheses are baked into the Common Core, into the tests that have been designed to support the Common Core, and they have received shockingly little debate, given how radical they are. One is a fascination with what Common Core advocates called close reading. This is the idea that students ought to learn to read by deciphering the text  preferably nonfiction, by deciphering the text without regard to other knowledge and without any personal reaction to the text. Now, I don't have a problem with close reading. It turns out when I taught high school two decades ago, I actually did a fair bit of this. But the idea that this is how every child at every grade level in every subject across an ocean ought to experience reading? I find that a radical proposition. Common Core embraces something called conceptual math. You may have seen some of the worksheets or the YouTube videos. This is the stuff that Carol was talking about, the idea that elementary children in particular ought to master math by learning the concepts, not just the arithmetic, and the best way to master these concepts is by composing and decomposing lots of these numbers in various drawing exercises. I don't have a problem with this as a way to teach kids math. I find it shocking that this should be the way all children of all performance levels across the nation ought to learn it. Third, the Common Core embraces something called informational text, informational reading. At the high school level it wants kids to read 70 percent informational text. It doesn't want to do this in English class, which is why we are now looking at children in chemistry classes, for instance, reading EPA reports. The idea that you are going to learn science more effectively by reading EPA reports than by doing lab is a radical proposition. In some, given that the Common Core doesn't solve the problem, it has been sold based on exaggerated claim and calls for major changes of a certain value, it seems to me reasonable not to embrace the darn thing. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. I'm delighted to be here at the National Constitution Center defending a proposition that is supported by the constitution's grand opening words. You all know them. We the people. As those words underscore, we individuals are sovereign. Therefore, we have no right more essential than the right to engage in our own political speech  speech about public affairs, speech about political campaigns. As the Supreme Court put it, speech concerning public affairs is more than selfexpression. It is the essence of selfgovernment. Especially essential is our right to criticize candidates, officials, and policies. Therefore, it's hard to imagine a greater violation of our precious free speech rights than for the government  in other words, incumbent officials  to limit our right to criticize them and their policies or to limit our right to advocate alternatives. It's likewise anathema for government to limit our right to band together with other likeminded individuals to amplify our voices. The Supreme Court first so held in landmark cases from the civil rights area involving the NAACP, which was a corporation. And from them, what I've said so far, individuals and our organizations clearly have a constitutional right to unlimited political speech. So, that means there's only one aspect of tonight's resolution that's really at issue. And that is whether we also have a constitutional right to unlimited spending in support of our political speech. But logically, the answer to that question clearly has to be yes, because unlimited spending is a prerequisite for unlimited speech. When the government limits how much we may spend on our speech, it necessarily limits the speech itself, in quantity and or quality. Think about it. Suppose the government imposed maximum spending limits on IQ Squared or on the National Constitution Center or  dare I say, on the Brennan Center for Justice? All of which are corporations, by the way. Those spending limits would clearly limit the amount that could be said by any of those fine organizations. Every communication requires some spending. And since costly TV ads are so important in election campaigns, you have to spend a lot to reach a critical mass of the voters. So, for government to limit what we may spend on our own political speech, including our criticism and our dissent, is for the government to limit our criticism and dissent. And that violates not only the rights of all of us dissidents, but also the rights of everyone to hear us. That point was wellmade back in 1957 by three of the greatest, most liberal egalitarian justices ever to grace the Supreme Court bench  Chief Justice Earl Warren, Hugo Black, and William O. Douglas. They were reviewing the very first federal law to limit spending on political speech. It banned such spending by corporations, and by labor unions on a rationale that we continue to hear, including from our esteemed opponents tonight, namely that these organizations are so rich and so powerful that they could be unduly influential. They could drown out others. But these justices resoundingly rejected that rationale as antidemocratic. As they explained It is we the people who are sovereign. It is there are vitally important that we the people have access to every view of every group in the community. After all, if there are any groups that are disproportionately powerful in the political process, it's the Constitutional media with their unique impact on public opinion. Yet we wouldn't even dream of letting the government limit what even the most powerful media company could spend on its political views. Even those who want to limit what the rest of us spend draw the line at the media even when they're part of conglomerates. But since media moguls have the right to unlimited spending on their political speech, surely it follows that the rest of us must have the very same right, otherwise it unfairly amplifies the voices of the rich and powerful people in groups who can afford to buy a media outlet. So that's just one of the reasons why spending limits actually undermine their stated goal, namely of leveling the playing field. Another reason is that spending limits favor incumbents and the two major particular parties, which should hardly surprise us because after all it's the incumbents who pass these laws. Now, our opponents are going to argue, and they already have, that these limits promote equality and integrity in our political system. Certainly these are extremely worthy goals. But as I've already noted, the goals are not in fact served. They are underserved by spending limits as Floyd will amplify on that further. For these reasons, please vote yes on the motion for unlimited political speech and therefore the unlimited spending that facilitates it and against government limits on what we the people may say and hear about it."

    "data": "Thank you, John. I too am delighted to be at the National Constitutional Center. I too care about we the people. I like to think I care about we, all the people, not just the people that have enough money to be able to engage in the kind of speech that occurs when you have utterly unlimited amounts of spending. We can't consider this in a vacuum. We have to look at facts. We can't think about this in a bubble. In the last election cycle, $6 billion we spent on campaigning. Of that $6 billion, almost 99 percent came from 1 percent of the population with the capacity to spend enough money to be able to bring their views into powerful play in the electoral process. Of that, 1/10 of 1 percent contributed vast amounts, about $6 billion, many of it unreported because of loopholes in the discovery laws. And of that 569 billionaires maxed out in a way in which they contributed vast sums and spent vast sums in impressing the rest of us with their views. Now, that means a small group of Americans, super citizens, I call them, has the ability to decide who gets to run for office because there's a wealth primary. Unless you can convince the rich to support you, you cannot run for office. They have a disproportionate effect on who wins because they can control the speech patterns in ways that allow them to speak to the community in an effective way even though their opponents may not be able to do so. And they control what we see and hear because they set the agenda because if they don't agree, then they simply don't support the candidate in the first place. Now, every election is turned into a one dollar, one vote election unless there are some restrictions, some restrictions on what people can spend in asserting their own views. Now, it doesn't have to be this way. It's correct for us to talk about Constitutional law. What does the First Amendment actually say about the proposition that we're talking about tonight? It says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. We can't read it literally because that would mean only Congress would be president, not the governor, not the cop on the beat. So we don't  we can't read it literally. And then it says, Shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, not abridging speech, but abridging the freedom of speech. Some human being must make a judgment about what goes in that protected category and what does not. So what fundamental mistakes have we made in saying that the freedom of speech gives the richest 1/10 of 1 percent of this country the capacity to dominate a democracy that is supposed to be one person, one vote? First, the  we said that equality doesn't matter, that trying to equalize the rough ability of all of us to affect the political process is not an adequate basis for justifying limits, not saying that you can't spend anything, not saying that you can't even spend a lot, but saying that there is absolutely no limit. The sky is the limit on what you can spend. And if you have a regime like that, forget about any idea of equal political participation because it's a fiction. Secondly, the idea that spending money at astronomical levels, it equals speech instead of power I think is a fiction. When you start spending money above a hundred thousand, 200,000, 500,000, a million, 5 million, to push your ideas into the public, at some point you have got a loudspeaker that is louder than anybody else's. And everybody, I think, would say that the volume of the speech is not the same thing as the speech so that there has to be some limit on the up side or else forget about any idea of egalitarian democracy. And we don't have to say that speech equals  that money equals speech. That was a mistake we made in 1976, and we can fix it. Third, the idea that corporations, profit making corporations  and we have to distinguish here between nonprofit corporations that are essentially just a group of people that gather together to advance their politics in a corporate form and corporations like Citicorp or pharmaceuticals or the oil companies that are essentially collections of individuals designed to sell things for a profit where the money comes from investors, it comes from consumers, and it comes from shareholders. Why should the management of those companies that assemble vast amounts of money in connection with their commercial activity  why should the managements of those companies be able to tap that money to advance their own political views in the give and take of an election? We made it much worse in 2010 when we took a system that said, very rich people could do that, and we parachuted in on top of it. Large corporations, profit making corporations without any attempt at distinguishing between a small corporation, a membership corporation like the NAACP or the Brennan Center or the ACLU, which is not in it for profit, and which has people that share their views and a huge corporation like General Motors."

    "data": "Good evening. I want to start with a point that Nadine made, which I don't think was responded to, and that is that without the ability to spend money, we don't have political speech, at least we don't have enough political speech to have a chance to win most elections. Look around this room. Imagine that this was not the national Constitution center but a political hall, but otherwise just the same, with all you people here. We couldn't have this event, we couldn't have a debate without paying for the lights, the microphones, the cameras, everything in the room. There are people here, I want to assure you not the speakers, who are being here tonight. And none of this could occur if people didn't spend money to back it up, to make it happen, to allow it to happen. Now, Burt talked about  he used the phrase about One man, one vote. We have never ever lived in a system of one speech, one person, or limited speech per person. We don't say that. We wouldn't imagine saying that to our newspapers or our media entities, however large they are. If you were to take Burt's point literally, you would say, It is  we cannot persist in the notion that Rupert Murdoch can have all the money and power he has, or that the Philadelphia Inquirer could have all the power that at least it once had in Philadelphia and that it certainly does to a significant degree today. It's perfectly true to say that people with money have more influence and power than people who don't. That's the way of the world. How do we deal with that? We can deal with equality as best we can as a public. We can have laws. Some of them we have already. We can have better laws about people being able to vote instead of closing polls early in the day. We can limit the money if that's what we're after. We can have higher taxes. I'm not advocating anything today. I'm just saying it doesn't violate the First Amendment to have a wealth tax. It doesn't violate the First Amendment to crack down on banks. It doesn't violate the First Amendment to have tougher antitrust laws. It does violate the First Amendment to limit speech. And that is what the negative side of this proposition necessarily is urging on you. Indeed, Burt did it. He is always straightforward. He was straightforward tonight. What is the argument? Too few people have too much power. And, therefore, what? They should not be allowed to speak as much as their money might allow, or, to put it differently, because they have more money and are prepared to spend it on political speech, our Congress, the very people who as Nadine pointed out have the most direct personal interest in passing legislation which will keep them in power  that the Congress can pass Constitutional legislation limiting the amount of their speech. The Supreme Court put it very well in 1976 in the Buckley case referred to by Burt. I want to read you one line. The court said, The concept that the government may restrict the speech of some elements in our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment. That's what the court said. That's what the law is right now. And I think it is a glorious articulation of First Amendment principle. And these were not the five supposedly rabid rightwing conservatives who gave us Citizens United. This was Justice Brennan, this was Justice Thurgood Marshall, this was Justice Potter Stewart, three of the most stalwart defenders of the First Amendment in our history. And what they were saying is, You can deal with problems in a lot of ways, you can deal with the equality problem in lots of ways, but the one way you can't deal with it is by shutting up the voices of others or limiting the voices of others, wholly foreign to the First Amendment. This is one of the things that makes us so special in the world. I mean, it's only we, and we should be proud of it, but only we have a first amendment as strong, as totally controlling over what Congress can do as we do. So I would urge on you that while to some degree I understand that it seems not fair that people who have more money should have more power, if you want to deal with it, and we should sometimes, if you want to deal with that, don't deal with speech. One of the First Amendment principles that's first is hurt speech last. So, I urge you to vote yes on this resolution. "

    "data": "Thank you so much. I want to point out, first of all, that my worthy opponents both relied heavily on arguments about limiting the press from speaking. That's an interesting debate, but that is not the debate we are having tonight. There is a separate clause in the constitution, a freedom of the press clause, which is put in there to protect especially particular kinds of institutions that play particular roles in our democracy. What I do think we are debating is we're having a debate about reality and we're having a debate about history. Both of my opponents, very persuasively argue, but I would argue they mostly argue from abstraction. Burt started his argument talking about money and how it actually influences politics. And I want to talk about history, because I think this is a constitutional debate in the most fundamental sense. It's about who we are, how we want to constitute ourselves, and what our most fundamental principles are. So, instead of starting with a text of the First Amendment, sort of separated from its own purpose and principles, I want to return to the Constitutional Convention across the street, 230 years ago and look at the core purposes of the constitution itself, because only once we really understand the constitution and what it is for, and what it was for, can we understand the place of the First Amendment in it. I've spent a lot of time reading the transcripts of the debates of the Constitutional Convention. And I'll tell you, there's one fear  the core principle is representative democracy. Figuring out a system where the public good could be represented. It's a really difficult puzzle. And there's one fear that dominated over every fear, and that was the fear of corruption. They talked about corruption more often than they talked about violence, more often than they talked about the threat of faction, more often than they even talked about this  current problems of the day. The threat was that this beautiful new country would fall victim to the power of money to distract representatives from their job to tend to the public good, the same way that they had seen Britain do. Pierce Butler said, Look at Britain. You know, there we've built the fairest society ever. And yet, corruption has destroyed that fabric. So, they weren't worried about some technical question of nonrepresentative democracy. They were worried about how money  in all these different guises  could come in and take away this sort of precious young country. At the time, the concerns were focused around gifts from kings  the king of France kept giving these really luxurious snuff boxes to diplomats. And there was a lot of anxiety that that would lead people like Benjamin Franklin to forget that his obligation was to this country and not to France. Another major concern was that people would go into office in order to get good jobs later  or at the same time. Butler also said, A man takes a seat to get an office for himself, for his friends. This is the source from which flows venality and corruption. If you look at the constitution, there's not just the First Amendment when it comes to money and politics. There's dozens of clauses. And each of these clauses is communicating that what the founders cared about was protecting against this thing which is the danger to all republics. So, when Alexander Hamilton was asked, What were you doing at the convention? he said, you know, Our job was to protect against   but to create every practicable obstacle against corruption. And Mason said, If we do not provide against corruption, we will soon be at an end. For the next 200 years in this  Courts understood that protecting against corruption was one of the core jobs of law itself. And so you would never see a lobbying case, lobbying was illegal in this country for a long time  a lobbying case or a money in politics case without a serious investigation about  of whether the laws that issue  or the structures that issue might lead representatives to forget their obligations to the public and instead serve other masters. 200 years after 1776, in 1976, you saw courts starting to forget that. I'm not going to go into the full history here, but my objection to the proposition is not what's in it, it's what's not in it. If you can't talk about the First Amendment without also talking about why it's there and without also talking about the ways in which it might lead to money taking over this extremely precious and rare thing, which is representative democracy. So starting in 1976, the character of money in politics has gradually dwindled and become smaller and smaller in all our court cases until recently, in Citizens United and McCutcheon vs. FEC where the great tradition of the First Amendment is weighed against basically a corruption which the justices call the same as bribery law instead of the old corruption that our founders understood. So I urge you to reject this proposition because so much is at stake; representative democracy itself."

    "data": "Thank you very much, John. I've been an academic neurosurgeon for over 20 years, and I fully believed in reductive materialism, our modern conventional science. In fact, six years ago I would've been sitting over on that side of the stage with Steven and Sean. Now, at that time I believed that the brain creates mind and consciousness, that we have no free will, that it's birth to death and nothing more. Then something happened. I now know that those ideas are false. In November 2008 I was driven rapidly into coma due to a severe bacterial meningoencephalitis which I much later came to realize is the perfect model for human death, destruction of the neocortex, the outer surface, the human part of the brain. Sadly almost no one returns, much less recovers, from a case of meningitis as severe as mine. The last evidence of any activity in my neocortex was in the first hour, so in the emergency room and afterwards I demonstrated only very pathological reflexes including severe brainstem damage. Given my gram negative bacterial meningoencephalitis, which I was found to have, and my descent into coma over three and a half hours, I had at best a 10 percent chance of survival at the very beginning. It only got worse. Mine was an absolutely lethal meningitis. My white cell count in my cerebral spinal fluid was 4,300 and a protein of 1,340. Both those numbers should be zero. In fact, the glucose in that fluid, normally 60 to 80, and maybe as low as 20 in a severe case of bacterial meningitis, went all the way down to one. None of the consultants in my case, from Harvard, UVA, Duke, or Wake Forest had ever seen that severe a case. My doctors never found a cause. The scan showed diffuse destruction of my neocortex with blurring of the graywhite junction over all eight lobes of my brain. No area was spared. Later in the week, off all sedation, my neurological activity was almost nil. With what's called a glass glaucoma scale, which in everybody in this room would be 15 and a corpse is three, my scale was ranging from three to five. This was a very severe meningitis. On day seven, with no residual neocortical function, brain stem badly damaged, reflecting the deadly nature of my illness, my doctors recommended, because I was down to a 2 percent chance of survival by that point, with a best case scenario that if I survived I'd spend a month or two in the hospital, be transferred to a nursing home, and die in a coma months later, hence, they recommended just stopping the antibiotics. My journey deep in the coma began in a very primitive unresponsive realm, which I later called the earthworm's eyeview, the best consciousness my brain could muster, soaking in pus. My prior neuroscientific view would've dictated that the next step would be one of no awareness at all. Yet, it was just the opposite, like the blinders coming off. I ascended into far more crisp, vibrant, ultra real realms of pure joy, love, and understanding, realms I called the gateway in the core, far too rich and complex to fully describe. Soon thereafter I started to return to this world, but with my brain so wrecked that I had no memory of words or language, nothing of Eben Alexander's life before coma, any religious concepts, et cetera, yet I knew the entire ultrareal odyssey that I had just been deep in coma, went [spelled phonetically] so extensive it seemed to last for months, even though it had to fit within seven days of earth time. Words came back to me over hours and days, childhood memories over weeks, and knowledge of brainmind consciousness of more than 20 years' experience in neurosurgery came back over two months. My doctors have no explanation at all for my full recovery. Other cases of medically inexplicable healing do occur in transcendental neardeath experiences, like those of Anita Moorjani and Dr. George Rodonaia. In the 36 hours after emerging from coma, I was in and out of a delusional, paranoid, psychotic nightmare that was completely different, not even in the same ballpark, when compared to the ultrareality of the deepcoma experience in the gateway in the core. Those experiences deep in coma seem almost seem to weigh too real to be real. My doctor's believing that the brain creates consciousness, and knowing the destruction they had seen in my brain, had told me that I could not have had any such experience in the depth of coma, and therefore just to forget about it. I knew I'd experienced something and sensed that it had to do with the fundamental flaw in the models of consciousness and the  and the role of the neocortex. Early on, I tried to explain all of this as a brainbased phenomenon based on my old paradigm, writing it up as a report for the neuroscience literature. It's important that when I was emerging from that coma, I saw six faces at the very end. And these were faces that were very important in helping me to realize that the entire coma experience happened between Days 1 and 5 of my coma, and not at the very end. Over those weeks of recording my experience after coma, I also began to talk with my doctors and review my medical records, especially neurological examinations and the scans, and came to realize just how deathly ill I was and how there was no way that such an ultrareal crisp and vibrant experience could have happened in my physical brain. Modern neuroscientific ideas of the neocortex and consciousness would dictate that I should have experienced nothing at all beyond that earthworm's eye view. I wrote the entire experience down, 20,000 words that I wrote over six weeks, before I read anything about near death experiences. I have never read that literature before. Initially, I was very worried that the memories would fade. Those memories are as sharp today as when they happened. Memories of the delusional paranoid psychotic nightmare that occurred over those 36 hours after I came out of coma faded within weeks. Very different origin. I had never read NDE literature before, and was shocked to find that the experience seemed hyperreal in over half of NDE accounts, and the memories do not fade like those of hallucinations, dreams, confabulations, or drug effects. People recount their own NDE stories to me by the hundreds, usually starting  I'd never told anyone this before, but even from over 50 years ago, as if they happened yesterday, I came to see that the similarities in the NDE and afterlife literature far outweighed the differences. And the commonalities across cultures, beliefs, continents, and millennia indicate an underlying constant reality of that realm. Many of the petty differences are due to our being so restricted by our earthly language. This is not like we're describing a trip to Disneyland. Personal biases and religious beliefs might taint the telling of those stories. But the core similarities remain striking."

    "data": "Thanks, John. It's a pleasure to be here defending such a cheerful and uplifting proposition, as death is, in fact, final. Driving around the streets of Los Angeles, where I live, you can't help but notice these gigantic billboards telling us All Men Must Die. Turns out they were advertisements for Game of Thrones, but I thought that they were advertisements for  our event here tonight. It's a similarly  you know, not quit as happy message as we might like to accept. Fortunately, we can open Dr. Alexander's book. It begins with a quote from Albert Einstein. Einstein says, A man should look for what is, not for what he thinks should be, to which I would like to reply, Exactly. you. We are bundles of cognitive biases. And one of the strongest biases we have is that we go easy on propositions that we would like to be true. What we should, in fact, do, is go especially skeptical on propositions that we would like to be true. And even I want it to be true, that death is not final. But we should hold something like that to an extraordinarily high standard of evidence. So, what are we actually being asked to accept? What should we expect the world to be like if death were not, actually final? For one thing, I would expect that the existence of souls persisting in the afterlife should be perfectly obvious. It should be just as clear that heaven exists as it is clear that Canada exists. But in fact, it seems that the souls persisting in the afterlife are kind of shy. They don't talk to us, except sometimes they do talk to us. I would expect, also, that when people did have near death experiences, and really talked to other souls in the afterlife, that they would come back with consistent, interesting, nontrivial stories to tell. But in fact, when Christians have neardeath experiences, they often say they've met Jesus. When Hindus have neardeath experiences, they meet Hindu deities. There was a little girl who had a neardeath experience, and she met a portly man wearing a red cap. She met Santa Claus. And we are told by some defenders of this that, well, Jesus dressed up as Santa Claus so as not to scare the little girl. Possibly, that is true. But we should be asking, are there other plausible explanations? I especially think that if we went and had a life after death and then came back to visit us, bringing some message back, that message would  should be as useful as possible. We are told that, you know, people have after death experiences, and they come back saying, you know what? Love is really important. I agree with that. But actually, I knew it already. What I would like to know is the cure for Alzheimer's disease. What I would like to know is something that I didn't already know brought back to us. But it seems that the souls in the afterlife tend to speak in platitudes. The story that we're told of life after death doesn't really hang together. What we have are personal testimonies like that from Dr. Alexander. So people say, with very sincere voices, that what they experienced was totally real. And I have no doubt in the sincerity of this testimony. What I'm asking is, is it possible that our brain is telling us that something was real, but that thing does not actually correspond to something that really happened. And when you ask it that way, the answer is obviously yes. Our brains are fooling us all the time. Steve Novella, my partner, will tell us about the neuroscience behind this. But basically, our brains are not like video recorders or photo albums. They're more like little theaters. When we try to remember something, it's much like imagining something that hasn't happened. It's more like running a script than reviewing a tape. And that's why, when we dream, when we hallucinate, when we have a neardeath experience, it is just as vivid as something that actually happened. In the legal community, they will tell you that eyewitnesses who tell you that  have a certain sincerity and conviction that their eyewitness testimony is true, that conviction is essentially uncorrelated with now true it actually is. The vividness or reality of a memory does not tell us that it was really real. So what is going on? We had this informal idea that there is a soul that sort of is a blob of spirit energy that takes up residence near the brain and drives us around like a soccer mom driving an SUV. But we've known for a long time that this picture doesn't make sense. Back in the 1600s, princess Elizabeth of Bohemia carried on a correspondence with René Descarteswho was trying to defend mindbody dualism. And Elizabeth demands, no, how could something immaterial like the soul affect something material like the brain or the body? Descartes was never able to answer that question. And these days, science has gone way beyond that. We know a lot more about what is happening. We can literally see memories being formed. We can see the chemical changes in neurons. So the soul is supposed to also have memories. How do the memories get from the neurons to the soul? We know that brains often have false memories in them. Does the soul in the afterlife carry those false memories, or are they somehow corrected after death? We even know the laws of physics by which the atoms, the electrons, the elementary particles in our brains behave. We know the equations that the electrons that are responsible for chemistry obey. And there's no ambiguity in these equations. They could always be wrong. It is always possible to say, well, we just don't know what is going on. That's fine. But what we have is the evidence of every experiment ever done telling us that these equations are correct. To overcome that, we would need very, very strong evidence, just one experiment, telling us how the soul is pushing around the chemicals in our brain. But we don't have that. What science says is that life or consciousness is not a substance like water or air. It is a process like fire. When you put out the flame on a candle, the flame doesn't go anywhere, it simply stops. And that is what happens when we die. So we're faced at the end with two scenarios. One scenario says that everything we think we understand about the behavior of matter and energy is wrong in a way that has somehow escaped notice by every experiment ever done in the history of science. And instead, there are unknown mechanisms that allow information in the brain to the transferred to blobs of spirit energy that persist after we die and can talk to the other blobs of spirit energy, but don't talk to us, expect sometimes they do. The other scenario says that physics is right and that people under stress sometimes have experiences that are not actually real. On the basis of rationality, it not a difficult decision to choose between these two options. On the basis of emotion, it might be difficult. But we need to have the courage to live life here in the actual world. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. Since 1965, I've had the honor of interviewing thousands of people from all over the world who had neardeath experiences. And unless you've been hiding in a cave somewhere for the last 40 years, you've all heard about this, that people on the brink of death tell us that they leave their bodies, and they go into a beautiful light which they find very difficult to describe. And in that light say that relatives or friends of theirs who have already died seem to be there to meet them and to help them through this transition. And they have panoramic memory in which they see all of the events of their lives displayed around them in a sort of holographic panorama of which they witness instantaneously. My assessment from 40something years of working on this, and I will underline that word assessment is that in the words of the proposition, death is not final. But I want to translate a little bit to say that what I'm trying to say with that is that in my opinion, at death, personal consciousness is taken up into a more inclusive state of reality or frame of existence in a way that people who go through this find it very difficult to put into words. One of the most common things they say is, however articulate they may be, they say that this experience is ineffable, or indescribable. I want to emphasize here something at the very beginning. And please hear me out on this one. I have decided, or sort of assessed the situation, that there is a life after death. However, I want to say anybody who tells you in the year 2014 that that is a scientific matter is not thinking clearly. In 2014, the question of life after death is not yet a scientific question. I am not a parapsychologist. And I think parapsychology is a pseudo science. So there's a different frame of reference to think about this, though. And that is that reason is a much bigger category than science. Scientific method is about, say, 400 years old. Reason itself is about 2300 years old, a much bigger institution that includes history and philosophy and literary theory and the law in addition to scientific thinking. So what I am suggesting to you is that the solution to the afterlife question is not going to come initially from science, but rather from, I think, the whole area of critical thinking and logic. As I look back on the debate that  on neardeath experiences that's gone on for almost 2500 years now, what strikes me is that a big part of the problem is that the format of the debate is basically twisted. Since Democritus and Plato fought this out 2300 years ago, the way we've debated this is we say that some people look at these neardeath experiences, and they take it at face value, as Plato did, and they say, well, this is an indicator of an afterlife. Other people Democritus being an example, said, as Democritus famously did, There is no such thing as a moment of death, implying that therefore what he's getting is that these neardeath experiences are just the patient's perception of the winding down process of the body. The trouble with this whole debate is that that format of debate itself is incoherent. We can't keep debating it that way. Let me give you an indication of why. All of the elements that we think of as a neardeath experience, getting out of the body, going into this light, seeing a panoramic review of one's life, seeing apparitions of the deceased occur very commonly, not just to people who almost die and are brought back, but rather to the healthy and uninjured bystanders at the bedside of someone else, shared death experiences, as I call these. As the person in the bed, it's fairly common that bystanders will say that they themselves leave their bodies and accompany their dying loved ones partway toward this light, or they see the apparitions of relatives and friends of the dying person come into the room. So my question is, if the causation of these neardeath experiences is the physiological distress and the events going on in the brain, why should the bystanders who are not ill or injured have identically the same experience? So I think that we're into a situation with this now where really the problem has sort of outgrown the format that we use to debate about it. In my opinion, we really are on the verge of breakthroughs in the genuine, and I will underline genuine, rational investigation of the question of life after death. And in that context, I think there are two people in history who have more than anyone else I think stated this afterlife question very clearly and the major problems that come with it, Plato being one, who said that, Whenever we talk about the afterlife, there's always going to be the narrative aspect, a story, because we've got to have some sort of story just to get thought about this kind of thing started, but also we've got to have some sort of set of concepts to link the  these narratives with the statement of what  that there is life after death. I think that's coming. I think that we are on the brink of a breakthrough in rational study of an afterlife, but it's not going to come initially from science, but initially from the realms of logic and critical thinking. So thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you. Thanks, John. I want to say thank you to the Intelligence Squared Debate for inviting me here. It's an honor to be here. So I'm going to convince you that you need to vote against this proposition because if you vote for the notion that death is not final then you  that by necessity means that you are voting against the conclusion, the scientific position, that the mind is what the brain does. The mind is a process of the brain itself. You would have to reject that in order to accept that the mind exists without the brain. Well, how sure are we? How confident are we in  as a scientific conclusion, which is what we're here to talk about, that the mind is essentially the brain? Well, we're very certain about that, and we're as confident of that as we are of anything in science. We have a mountain of neuroscience, countless experiments, that look for the neuroanatomical correlates of consciousness, of the brain functioning, of the mind. Everything that you think, feel, believe, is something that's happening inside the brain, demonstrably. But let's take that as a scientific hypothesis. If the mind is entirely the brain, then what must also be true? Well, then if the arrow of causation's going from brain to mind, then if we change the brain, that should change the mind. And if we damage the brain, that should damage the mind. And if we turn off the brain, that should turn off the mind. Well, if all of those propositions are correct, that strongly supports the notion that the mind is essentially the brain, and that is, in fact, exactly what scientists have discovered over and over again over the last one to two centuries of neuroscience. I can give you  I'm a neurologist, so I can give you tons of examples from my own personal clinical experience. But let me just tell you about one very interesting neurological phenomenon called Capgras Syndrome. This is a syndrome in which  well, I'll give you  I'll back up a little bit. So when you're looking at, let's say, the face of your wife or your spouse, what's forming on your retina is just shapes and shadows and colors and lines, but your brain has to construct that into an actual image. But then it also have to give meaning to the image. It has to tell you that these shapes are, in fact, a face. And then another part of the brain tells you, That's not just any face. That's the face I know well. That's the face of my spouse, the face of my wife. Now, assuming, however, you have feelings about your wife  let's assume that  then  there's also a connection between that part of your brain that tells you that that face is your wife to the limbic system. That's the emotional part of your brain. And that connects your emotions, your feelings about your wife to that image. So, when you see your wife, those feelings are connected to it. Those are all circuits that are happening demonstrably in your brain. Now, in Capgras Syndrome, that last connection is broken by a stroke, by damage, by something. So, when someone sees their spouse, they recognize them as their spouse. But the feelings aren't there. So, what do people conclude when this happens? Well, it's interesting. When people have brain damage, it affects how their brain constructs their image of reality, because as my  as Sean was saying, are  we don't have a tape recorder in our minds, in our brains. We are constructing reality and image of reality all the time. It's a very active process. And when you  when that process breaks down, then your construction of reality breaks down. So  and you usually don't have insight into that, especially initially, because we tend to assume that our experience is a real, continuous experience. That's also something your brain constructs. So, what do people conclude when they have this syndrome, that circuit is broken in their brain? They conclude that their wife, their spouse must be an impostor . That's the only explanation that they can come up with. There's, in fact, a documented case of a husband who murdered his wife because he was convinced that an impostor had replaced his wife, you know, with an exact  you know, it makes no sense, but that's the only way his brain could make sense of its broken construction of reality. And there's endless examples of this. There's no limit  there is no practical or functional limit that neuroscientists have encountered so far to the degree which we can mess with your mind by messing with your brain. Your  your sense that you're in your body, that you control your body, that you separate from the universe  basic fundamental things about your concept of yourself and your experience of reality are all things demonstrably happening in the brain, and we could turn it off like a switch. Now we actually have the technology to do that. So, given the mountain of evidence that the mind is the brain, we wouldn't reject this easily. Do near death experiences provide such compelling evidence that there is mental activity outside of brain activity, that we need to reject the mountain of neuroscientific evidence that's growing every day, that tells us that the mind, in fact, is the brain? Well, I think the answer there is definitely no as well. There are  as Sean said, there are stories  anecdotes, compelling narratives. We're all about compelling narratives. That's what our brain does  that people have had very unusual experiences. We don't doubt that they have had, you know, lifealtering, unusual experiences. Whenever your brain is constructing reality in a different way that you're not used to, that's going to be a very weird, profound experience. It's going to be memorable. It's going to be amazing. Astonishing, even. We have no doubt about that. But it's demonstrably something happening in the brain. What we don't have are any documented cases of mental activity occurring when there could not be brain activity. Now, proponents will often say that, Well, but the person remembers being, you know, in the emergency room, or they remember  they have these memories that were forming while their brain wasn't functioning. But we don't know that. There is no case in which that's been documented. They easily could be forming their memories when they're coming out of their  whatever state, whatever coma that they were in. Dr. Alexander even says he had a prolonged recovery. We have no idea what was happening in his brain during that period of time. When people are in a coma, there's still some break activity. There are animal experiments showing that sometimes even during an acute stress, there could be even a burst of neural activity. Who knows what kinds of astonishing memories are occurring there? We have a reality testing module in our brain, a circuit in our brain that says, This feels real to me. And that testing module could break down. And then things  you don't test reality. It just seems hyperreal. Every element of a near death experiment  experience can be duplicated, can be replicated with drugs, with anoxia, with lack of blood flow, by turning off circuits in the brain. Every single component is a brain experience that we could now reproduce. And we're zeroing in on the exact circuits in the brain which reproduce them. That's why you must vote against this proposition. Thank you."

    "data": "Thanks. It's always nice when people mention narcissism and then they start laughing. I never know why, but it's always like a bad exrelationship or something. What I'm here to argue for is that Millennials Don't Stand A Chance. What I'm not here to do is malign millennials or bash millennials. That's fun. I just don't want to do it. I don't want them to fail. I don't want my kids to fail either who are going to be the next generation. But, that said, I think there's a lot of problems. And to sum it up easily as I can I'd say there is a major disconnect or major gap between how young people were raised in the '80s and '90s, they're born in  people born in the '80s and '90s, the millennials, and the world they're facing today. Think about it this way, they were raised with a very inflated optimistic view of themselves and the world. And they're  we've given them a really terrible place to get a start. Let me just expand on this a little bit. If you think about the millennial self, these are kids that started  that were born in the '80s, they started school right when the selfesteem movement hit. This was brought to us by the good people in California in 1982, started going through schools  the idea was if we can give kids selfesteem they'll do better in life. And the way to give kids selfesteem is not to have them succeed at optimal challenges or have strong relationships, which actually works, it was to tell them they're special and unique and give them lots of awards and trophies as people sort of lament. So we set people off that way. And we do have a generation with very high selfesteem, especially college students. Selfesteem is near the top of the scales we measure. We also see some of the darker side of selfesteem with that. We do see increasing narcissism. It wasn't like it was flat with Gen X and then jumped up, but it just keeps going up and up. We see increasing uniqueness. We see this with the names we've given kids, and this is the millennials, but we're still doing this. I mean, now with our children born today we don't even give them names. If we're celebrities we name them directions on a compass so our  name them after fruit  so these kids are given a sense of specialness, they think they're better than others. We've raised expectations in young people dramatically, where they have high expectations about professional careers, they have high expectations about going to graduate school, and, again, it's great to raise expectations if you can provide a reality for that. And finally there's been this big shift in values. There's been a switch from what we call intrinsic values, which the baby boomers tended to have, to much more extrinsic values. To give you an example of the biggest change would be something like in the baby boom people said, I want a meaningful philosophy of life. People don't say that anymore. People aren't looking for their true self. What they're looking for now is a job to make lots of money. Again, that's fine, it just doesn't fit with our world. So if you take that inflated psychology the millennials were raised with and you look at reality right now, we have very high youth unemployment, we're talking about 12  a little over 12 percent for people in the young 20s with very liberal numbers of unemployment. We have a trillion dollars in student loan debt. And student loan debt is horrible. I mean, this isn't like, Gee, I bought a McMansion . Oh, I can't afford it. I can live in it for three years and send the keys back. And this is like I can't get rid of this stuff because the government says, 'You can't get rid of it.' You have massive levels of competition for jobs. You have massive levels of competition for those elite education tracks. I mean, people are hiring people to write college essays now, it's  I mean, like paying to make 30 grand to get into college. The millennials are having to put off marriage. The average marriage age now for women is 27, 29 for men. You have over a third of young people 18 to 30  living back at home with their parents. Not necessarily in a basement. Lots of homes don't have basements, but maybe over the garage. Maybe someplace else. And yet  I mean, even now, sociologists talk about this period of emerging adulthood  age 20 to 24  which is something we didn't talk about 20 years ago. These people are in a cocoon and they're going to butterfly out as adults. And they might. We have decrease in civic engagements. Most measures we look at  millennials volunteer more than any generation we've studied. So, that number has gone up. They voted a lot for Obama's first term. But other than that, civic engagement has dropped. And generally, the sense of trust we have in the country for each other and for our major institutions  our journalists, our government, our religion  is at the lowest point we've ever measured. I mean, the country in terms of just our basic civil institutions is collapsing. Bottom line, and people grown up, raised by us  they don't raise themselves. They're raised to have a very positive view and a very optimistic view. And they're put in a reality that is incredibly challenging, incredibly negative. Some are making it. Some are doing great stuff in entrepreneurship. They're creating their own jobs. Other people are part of what I think of as the great fantasy migration. They're dressed up as Wookies or Stormtoopers, or they're living in their mom's basement, playing World of Warcraft. And you get a lot of ego needs met that way and have a lot of good relationships.

And that, you know, in part because we've seen what's happened to the world and we have decided to pull back on buying frivolous things. We have healthy relationships with our parents, reported highest levels of healthiness among all adults today. And we have a deep entrepreneurial spirit, as the [unintelligible] mentioned. So, why do our detractors say that we're doomed? They say we're immature, immoral narcissists who want to live in our parent's basement. It's always the basement. Or maybe the attic. So, these stereotypes are based on false media narratives. And I am urging you to vote against the proposition because I'm going to dispel those falsehoods. And my partner, David, he's going to tell you about some of the under reported truths about millennials. So, let's start with that first myth, that basement myth. So, it's true that a greater percentage of millennials live at home than previous generations. But the degree to which that's true has been completely exaggerated. Keith said a third. That's not the numbers I've read. The numbers from Pew are that 15 percent of millennials live at home, compared to 12 percent of boomers and 13 percent of GenX. So, I don't know where they're getting that. And the second part of the myth is that it's necessarily a bad thing. Half of the millennials who live at home are in college. And so, I think it's better for them to be living with their parents while they get an education than to be wasting money they don't have on dorms and apartments. So, the second part of the myth is that the people who aren't in college are just sponging and they're playing video games all day. So, I have two examples here. One is Lena Dunham, because you cannot have a debate about millennials without mentioning Lena Dunham. She is the creator of HBO's Girls. If you don't know who she is. She lived at home after graduating from college to make her first feature film, which went to South by Southwest and led directly to her being the creator, star, and writer of her own HBO show, which is the most zeitgeisty show in generations. So, maybe you think, Dunham is privileged. She's not a good example. So, how about Sophia Amoruso? She was making $13 an hour. She was a community college dropout when she was living at  with a family member in their cottage. She started an online business, selling vintage clothing on eBay. That online business has turned into a multimillion dollar organization called Nasty Gal Clothing. She employs 300 people. So, I don't think she would have been able to do that if she had to pay rent on some bad apartment. Really having that support allowed her to launch herself into the world. So, the second myth is that we're immature. And some of this immaturity is said because we're not buying cars and we're not buying homes like the people in generations before us did. And that's not because we don't have the maturity. It's because we prefer to live sustainably, not just financially sustainably, but environmentally sustainably. We want to live in close communities. We use public transportation. And I think that that's all to the good. With the age of the McMansion and the SUV, the ginormous SUV, that's over, and good riddens to that. So the third myth is that we're immoral, and, as Keith mentioned, we're less religious. But if you actually ask millennials why they've left the church or temple that they were raised in, a full third of them say that it's because of their church's values about the LGBT community. So I think that actually shows a huge amount of moral backbone to be able to question what you were raised in and to be able to say that you want to be on the right side of history. So the fourth myth, and it's the most pervasive myth, is that we are narcissists. And what galls me is that it's always the boomers saying this. And they were the original narcissists. I mean, I think they forget that Tom Wolfe called them the me generation in 1976. But  so Keith has told you that we have this inflated, overoptimistic sense of the world. But that's not my impression at all. If you went back to 2000, David Brooks wrote an article in the Atlantic called the organization kit. It might have been 2001. I was either a freshman or sophomore in college. And that was a much more accurate picture of how we were raised. We were raised to know that we are competing in a global world. Remember, everybody had to learn Japanese in the '80s and '90s, because they wanted us to  our parents wanted us to compete the same way that kids are learning Mandarin today. And he says, you know, we are more narcissistic because we agree with statements like, I will be a success. You know, those are just statements. You know, it's just words. And I think actions speak so much stronger than that. As has been said, we volunteer more than any generation. 73 percent of millennials volunteered for a nonprofit in 2012. And the percentage of college freshman believing that it's essential or for very important to help people in need is the highest level it's been at in 40 years. There are the lowest levels of drug use, teen pregnancy and youth crime. That speaks louder than any multiple choice test to me. So I'm not going to stand here and say we weren't dealt a bad hand. Like it's been said, we graduated into a recession. The jobs are scarce, and that there are systemic problems in America with poverty and income inequality that plagues all generations, not just us. But I think that millennials are uniquely qualified to solve these problems because we're committed to social justice, we're committed to sustainability, and we have this entrepreneurial spirit. So I really urge you to vote against the proposition because we are so far from doomed. We're just getting started."

    "data": "Good evening, everybody. So I'm a lover, I'm not a fighter. I'm not here to fight, I'm not here to bash, I'm not here to talk about all of the reasons why millennials are horrible people and are going to fail of their own doing because I don't believe that. I mentor millennials, and I educate them. And I am a firm believer in their capacity. With that said, the picture is not nearly as rosy as it's been painted by my esteemed opponent, Jessica. So a couple of things that I'd like to unpack. First, the notion that millennials are the most educated generation in the history of humanity, ever. We can look at that from a quantitative perspective, and we can also look at that from a qualitative perspective. Let's talk about it first quantitatively. My generation, generation X, the forgotten generation. Everybody likes to skip over us. We don't have complexes. We invent companies like Google, actually. It was X that invented Google, not Y. Correction from earlier tonight. So my generation, at this point, depending on the study you look at, we range in education from 30 to 45 percent having completed the equivalent of a fouryear college degree. If you look at the Boomer Generation, between the ages of 55 to 64  and again, I'm reminding you of the quantitative versus the qualitative assessment. If you look at the boomer generation, the boomer generation is now around 32 percent. The very wonderful cohort that comes up behind me, they are currently at or estimated to be around 33 percent. So this notion that they have more education at this point in time than anybody else is actually not true from a quantitative perspective. It's also not true qualitatively. And what do I mean by that? The quality of education in the United States as we all know and have been reading about over and over and over again has been declining precipitously over the course of the last several decades, in particular as concerns science and mathematics. That people are taking tests, that they are taking APs, that they are going to college does not mean that they are learning any better, particularly in an environment where our government has insisted on teachers teaching to the test instead of developing deep critical analytical thinking skills that are absolutely and unequivocally necessary in our workplace. So qualitatively is not quite there either. Let's also discuss this notion of what a millennial is. I think far too often, when we're having conversations about when a millennial is and what a millennial isn't, we do talk about Lena Dunham, and we talk about Mark Zuckerberg. But I think that they are far and away the exceptions for the millennial population. As noted, the millennial group is the most diverse in the history of humanity. 43 percent are nonwhite. Of that 43 percent who are nonwhite, 35 percent of them are black and Hispanic. The black and Hispanic millennials are in primarily underperforming schools, they are mostly unemployed, they are not receiving college degrees at the same rate. And the situation for them is particularly bleak and really, really bad. I'm going to keep going with this theme a little bit further because we can't just talk about the exceptions. We have to talk about the whole. So when we say on our side that millennials don't stand a chance, we're not talking about Jess, we're not talking about David, we're not talking about a couple of my millennial mentees who are here tonight, we're not talking about the millennial entrepreneur whom I have given some advice to. We're talking about all of the rest of them. We can't focus on just 1 percent or 5 percent or 10 percent of the stars. So even with that, 66 percent of millennials are not earning college degrees, right? That sounds like it's a high number, and it's not when you think about the number of people who have actually earned their college degrees. But in an economy that is a knowledgebased economy, where increasingly we need people with these computer science and engineering degrees, it's pretty bad, right? And it's bad because, as was alluded to earlier tonight, we're entering into the age of artificial intelligence. We're entering into the age of machine learning. The kinds of jobs that we've prepared millennials to take, right, are not going to exist. And so then what do they do? They're going to end up in jobs and careers unless there is a dramatic intervention, which I will argue we need to have a dramatic intervention, then will end up in the kind of jobs and the kinds of careers where they are overeducated and underpaid. And that's not particularly good, particularly for a generation, as Keith has already said, which has $1.1 trillion worth of student debt, which, by the way, Jessica, is the reason many analysts are saying millennials are staying home. So I'm sure it's very nice to have anecdotal evidence suggesting that millennials are staying because they like their parents. I too like my parents. I'm extraordinarily close with my parents. I wish they could have made it tonight. I actually have a lot of millennial qualities. That's not a bad thing. But I think that financial independence for most of us and for most adults means that we want to move out of the house at a certain point. And that's important for another reason, not because we want people to overconsume, but because the traditional indicators for economic growth and what that relies upon is a form of consumption that relies on housing strikes that relies on housing formation, that relies on purchases of furniture and purchases of appliances and other things millennials are currently not able to afford in part because those who are college educated, who are not undereducated, right, so the undereducated millennials are in the absolute worst position. Those who are college educated, to the extent that they weren't qualified to get the hightech jobs, which most of them are not qualified for, as I've already suggested, they're in jobs which don't actually require a college degree. And so they're not earning enough money. And this is isn't, by the way, any of their fault. I have about 45 seconds left, so I'm going to hit on two more important points. None of this is the fault of the millennial generation. All of this is the fault of the kinds of policies, Baby Boomers, the greatest generation, and even a few people who are in the Generation X in Washington right now have put into place. It's the absence of a good jobs policy. It's the inability for us to work on entitlement reform and shifting all of that burden to millennials. And so it's no wonder that this generation is completely stressed out. And if I had more time, I would begin to tell you about the very difficult numbers of 44 percent of college students evidencing or suggesting that they have some level of depression. Things are not as good as they seem. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thanks, John, and thanks to all of you for being here tonight. You've heard obviously a lot of things already about millennials. And, as Jessica mentioned, I'm going to hit on a couple things that are true about millennials that I think are important to consider in this context. I am a millennial, as was stated earlier. And I have been spending the past several years really trying to understand what this generation is and what this generation means and particularly thinking about how it relates to the context of the world that we're living in. And I want to just highlight that. I'll come back to that later, thinking about the context of this world and what that means. I got my start, as was mentioned earlier, in political engagement, thinking about young people in political engagement. And the trend we have seen in youth political participation over the past several election cycles is really remarkable. And this is in the face of a generation who has seen arguably the most toxic political climate that we've seen in many, many years, who has turned out in record numbers to vote in recent elections, who have actually had an incredible role in pushing issues like gay marriage to be where they are at today. This is the generation who has the largest support of that issue. And it's a generation who have actually worked on campaigns. They've gone to volunteer. They've gotten deeply engaged in what it means to be a candidate for office. In fact, just this Sunday I was in Pennsylvania for a person in this generation who was actually running for office. So I think there's a lot to consider there about the role of this generation in politics and how that contributes to that. And when Keith talks about civic engagement and the lack of civic engagement in this generation and says that voter participation [unintelligible] volunteerism are up, I think that there are other measures of at least political engagement  there aren't very other many measures you can measure when you look at that. So it's really a deeply engaged generation. It's also the first generation that truly is a global generation, that understands the role of their relationship to the rest of the world. And as you think about, you know, what Robert was mentioning earlier about jobs going to India and other places, this is a generation that gets that. For previous generations, people have actually had the choice about whether or not they wanted to recognize that there was another part of the world out there. This is the first generation who has no choice but to realize that and deeply understands that. In fact, 93 percent of people in this generation say that they at some point in their life expect to live or work globally. So it's really a generation that's in tune with the reality of the world that we're living in. You also look at this generation in terms of social activism, which is also something I've spent a lot of time thinking about. And it's true that volunteerism is up, but one of the most remarkable things that's happened over the past several years is you've seen record numbers of people in this generation starting their own businesses, starting their own organizations, and caring about issues as diverse as gang violence on their own street or international development in Africa. And you see this incredible range of people from different socioeconomic backgrounds who are participating in trying to make the world a better place. In fact, an overwhelming majority of people in this generation actually say they would take a job that pays them less money if they could have more impact in that work. And you see record numbers of applications for programs like Teacher America, the Peace Corps, a lot of which has followed ever since 9/11, which in a lot of ways was an important civic moment for this generation, which really allowed people to see that there was something that as individuals we can do. For us, if you think about the context for the past several years of what this generation has gone through, growing up in an age where we lived under the specter of two wars, where we saw every one of our biggest institutions fail, banks, educational systems, our political system, it is incredible to know that this is a really resilient generation. In the face of the economic crisis, people in generation actually became more optimistic about their own economic future. And those numbers are still true today. In fact, eight in 10 people in this generation, according to a Pew study that just came out a couple weeks ago, say that they have enough money now to live the life that they want to life or  and that they will in the future. And you also look at the fact that 75 percent of the people in this generation have given to  have given to charity over the past several years. And 49 percent say that America's best days are ahead of us. All of these numbers, by incidentally, have tracked over the past several years, as people have been following millennials. And they're also relatively on par or higher with people in this generation than they were in their counterparts' years before. But the final thing that I wanted to talk about is this role of entrepreneurship. Binta sort of made the point about the fact that there are only a handful of people who are doing this. But it's important to note, first of all, that there are the largest number of selfmade millionaires and billionaires in this  under the age of 35  that exist in this generation that have ever existed. And if you were talking about whether or not millennials don't stand a chance, I think that's an important consideration, to look at the amount of wealth creation  not just what that means in the raw numbers, but what that means in terms of the kinds of things that this generation is capable of. You know, as John pointed out, when I was being introduced, this is a generation that doesn't think about Should I do this? Should I not do this? But it's a generation that actually jumps into action. In the face of the economic crisis, well   there were a number of suicides related to economic challenges for people of older generations. There was not a single such one for people in this generation. When you look at these indicators of how that economic crisis fared, people in this generation became incredibly resilient in looking at  looking at the future and continue to do that today. In fact, an overwhelming majority of people in this generation say that someday they might like to start their own company. Whether or not people actually do that is another question, but the idea that people are thinking in that kind of way gives us a kind of strongheadedness and resilience that I think will be very positive going into the future. The jobs of this economy, in this environment  are different. But this is a generation that has grown up in the future, in this new world, who's absolutely ready to fight and compete for that kind of work. And it's a generation that really has accomplished in its short lifetime an incredible amount. So, I'm going to  I'm going to stop now. I'm looking forward to discussing with you guys a little more."

    "data": "You know, I'm going back to when I was an undergraduate, oh my god, 30 years ago, 32, 31 years ago. I'm sitting in class and this is like most of the classes I've been in. This was at IIT in Madras, lots of bright kids around me, extraordinary and bright. And the fifth minute mark was my transition point, I would follow everything the lecturer did, the instructor did until the fifth minute mark, and then at the fifth minute mark I would lose the professor. And I would look at all  and everybody seemed to be following the professor, but I would've lost the professor and then spent the remaining hour simply scrambling taking notes, completely  I just lost the professor, scrambling taking down every word with no idea what is going on. I wonder how many of you in the audience have felt like that in a classroom. I won't ask for a show of hands, I just want you to think about it. I certainly felt oh my god, everybody around me knows what's going on, what's up with me? Our education system, this whole system of the lecture and getting together a lot more students in the classroom really is based on the factory model of education. Get a whole bunch of people sitting in a classroom and then you have a person lecturing at them. It's a very, very efficient system, it started a thousand years ago, and this university below me is still standing, it's a thousand years old, and you know what? Nothing has changed. You could wake up a thousand years behind you or a thousand years ahead and absolutely nothing has changed. Everything has changed around us, but the university education system hasn't. Our communication is different. We don't have to yell across a continent. We have smartphones. Our medical system has changed. We don't have to hit somebody on the head to knock them unconscious and operate very quickly. We have laparoscopy today, but education system hasn't changed. We can fly from one continent to another, communicate in all kinds of ways, but our education system hasn't changed. Don’t you believe it is important? We can do  the online education of today is very different from my grandfather's online education. It's completely different today. In this new system we can use selfbased learning. Just imagine I can watch a video of an instructor. I can pause the video. I can rewind the video. Not once, but six times. Heck, I can even mute the professor. This selfbased system allows me to learn at my own pace. I wish I had that when I was an undergraduate student. Another thing, I would submit my homework and I would get the graded homework back two weeks later if I was lucky. I still haven't gotten some homework back 32 years later. No feedback. The feedback came too late. I wasn't interested in the feedback when it came late. But in online learning today, if you go onto edX.org or one of the MOOC platforms, feedback is instantaneous. We can grade all kinds of questions, equations we can even grade essays, believe it or not. So that feedback comes instantly. I can get a  when something's wrong I can think about it, fix it. I can learn. In fact, I learn the most when something is wrong say hey, what do I do here? I can try to fix it. Instant feedback is critical. In the many, many studies education researchers have known this for 40 years. Study Chen in 2003 showed that if you apply instant feedback students learn better. If you don’t provide instant feedback they don’t learn as well. We also do another thing, we use active learning. Again, these ideas are old ideas, we've just not applied them. There’s a very famous paper by Craik and Lockhart talked about active learning. Heck, just go back to Socrates. It's a Socratic method. You know, you teach by asking questions. So now what we can do is we can interweave videos with interactive exercises. So you watch a video at your own pace then you go answer a question to see if you've learned the material or not. This is mastery learning. If you haven't quite gotten it you go back and review the video or the materials, you come back and you try it again. So this way you don’t face forward until you have picked up and really learned the material. And studies like the Craik and Lockhart study from as early as ’72 has shown that this, again, improves learning outcomes. So online learning today incorporates all of these principles and is completely different from what it was before. We can even bring gamification to our system. We can do online labs, check out the demo course on edX, it’s called Demo 101. We have online labs in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics. You can play around and bring gamification into the picture. Our millennial generation is completely different. Just two weeks ago I remember walking past my daughter's room, she's 14, and she was lying in bed. She's got three screens in front of her. Okay, on one screen she was doing physics. On the second screen, she swiped my iPad, and she's watching Netflix, and on her third screen, she was WhatsApping, now, whatever that is, with her friends. It's not tweeting anymore. It's WhatsApping with her friends. And they learn differently. The millennial generation is able to do these things. And then in the classroom, you still need that. You interact with each other, learn the soft skills and so on and so forth. But they can get all the content and so on completely online if that's how they want to learn. They want gamification, they want engagement, not the same old boring lecture where they lost the professor after the first minute everywhere. Everybody should really have a highquality education. And with online learning, I can really bring this to the classroom as well. And bringing online learning to create the blended model of learning. In an experiment we did with San Jose State University, they used their online material in class to create the blended model. Students would watch videos, interactive exercises in this active learning model before they came to class. And in class, they would ask questions of the professor, interact with other students and learn soft skills and collaboration. But a big part was online. And here they demonstrated that traditionally, the students were  60 percent of the students would pass the course, 40 percent would fail. In this blended model at San Jose State using our material online, they found that the failure rate fell to 9 percent."

    "data": "Thank you. And then there were MOOCs. The latest technological messianic movement that will disrupt and then save higher education. I want to make 12 points in six minutes as to why you should vote against the motion that more clicks will end the need for bricks and alter fundamentally the nature of higher education. Online education will not replace the great colleges and universities in the United States. At the selective colleges, MOOCs will be one of the many forms of new technology that will be useful, mostly for courses, as was pointed out by my worthy opponent, for those where you can get the right answer that's at the back of the book. For all other courses where there are subtleties and interpretation, where there's a need to argue, for a closeknit community of participants, where there's a need for critical thinking, for close reading, where analysis plays back and moderates initial formulations, MOOCs will be less useful. In fact, as the biological scientist Stuart Feinstein says, Questions are more relevant than answers. Indeed, Richard Levin recently signed on as the CEO of Coursera, and he said that it couldn't replace the traditional fouryear residential college. Let's take the democratizing effect. Levin says that's what one of the purposes is. But who in fact takes those courses from all over the world. The noble purpose, the people who take that course at least from the evidence that we have to the moment, are people who are already educated, not the people who we're trying to target for education. The next point is that there is no good empirical evidence that supports the idea that MOOCs represent a disruptive technology that will overturn the current business model of the best colleges and universities. Let me just tick off a few of the things for which there is absolutely no good empirical evidence. There's no economic or cost model that has been shown to work. The cost of creating content is very high. Friends of mine have told me that they spend $100, $200,000 or $300,000 a course. In short, there's no evidence that MOOCs will in fact lower the cost of tuition. There's no method that has been shown as to how intellectual property will be divided up, how much will go to the professors, how much to the university? There's no good evidence that MOOCs have a democratizing effect as much as they might be desirable to have a democratizing effect. There's no good evidence of how people with different learning styles respond to the flipped classroom and the MOOC culture on campus. There's no good evidence on how you can examine thousands of people taking online courses without massive cheating. There's no good evidence about who drops out of MOOC courses. Those 7,000 who graduated may well have been people who already took the course at MIT. Now, how do we know who they really are and what their characteristics are? 72 percent of the professors who answered the questionnaire about teaching online courses, who were committed to them, said that they would not give credit for those who did well in the course. Sebastian Thrune, one of the founders of one of the leading MOOCs, Udacity, has said we were on the front pages of the newspapers and magazines and at the same time I was realizing we don't educate people as others wished or as I wished. We have a lousy product. It was a painful moment. People learn from each other when they eat together, read together, converse together, sleep together. If nothing else, sex will reinforce bricks over clicks on the campus. This is not to say, I want you to know that the Khan Academy where small, short, highly focused courses are offered won't be appealing to some. It is, and it will be. But it is not going to end the need for the kind of close interaction that we need to find in the classroom in physical structures. MOOCs will not solve the cost disease. I will answer what the cost disease is and why they won't actually lower tuition and the increases in tuition that you have read about in the papers during our next part of this debate. Let many platforms grow. I don't know how many of you have seen Brian Greene, the physicist at Columbia's new platform on  he created for the world science fair, it takes place in New York. He built it himself. It is for people who know nothing about science to Nobel prize winners. It is far more sophisticated than the platforms like edX. One author allowed many of these platforms to grow and see how they work. MOOCs are one tool that will help to make higher learning better, not cheaper, for both undergraduates and professional school students. It's not likely to infiltrate the world of the laboratory, however. Remember, what makes American universities the greatest system of higher learning in the world is the research discoveries that have changed our lives and the lives of people around the world. You never hear the MOOC discussers, the MOOC proponents, talk about the influence of MOOCs on laboratory life. It will have a tremendous effect on accessing information; JSTOR, ARTstor, visual libraries, all of these things are wonderful inventions and part of technology that help us learn. But that is no substitute for being able to analyze Moby Dick."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you so much for having us, and thank you, Jonathan, for pointing out two very important things; first, that I should have absolutely gone to Columbia as an undergrad because they have sex in class. And I certainly made a huge mistake going to Penn. We did not have that. And secondly, thank you for making such a compelling argument to vote for this motion. The  what Jonathan put together as the framework was a critique of the state of online education, not even online education, but a segment of online education today, as it stands. It was not a critique of the potential of online education, and it was based on an analysis of a very small portion of American higher education, these small courses in the most elite institutions in the United States. But we're not talking about the future of the most elite institutions. We're talking about the future of higher education in general. And so let's look at the facts. The facts of the matter are that when you look at what even the elite universities do, they are largely about disseminating knowledge, lecture based courses, the lecture hall, where a university professor stands up in front of a large audience, gets paid $300,000, $400,000, fully loaded, and teaches one, maybe two courses a year to 200 students, is not an economically viable model. And it is in fact a worse form of delivery than what Anant described, the very first version, the version 1.0, of these massive open online courses. The fact of the matter is, is that all of the problems listed about MOOCs, whether we're talking about who is taking them, cheating, whether we're talking about the completion rates, whether we're talking about whether or not it's economical to create the upfront costs, all of those problems got solved over time. And even before they do, with identity verification online, with the fact that once you create one of these MOOCs, it can be taken to hundreds of thousands of dollars  once you realize that the fact that these courses are not completed or they're taken by the people that already have a university education, not because they're the only ones that can benefit from them, but because today they're not issued for credit. Compare completion rates at massive open online courses  that are there purely for fun  versus the completion rate at Chicago Community College. They're both in the single digit percentages. But when you go to Chicago Community College, you're going there and paying to get your associate's degree. Here you have an opportunity to learn for free, and you have an opportunity to learn at your own pace with those around you. But let's go beyond the lecture. Let's address even the most esoteric elements of higher education. The close conversations between students and professor is small groups that explore subject matter. Well, turns out you can do that online as well, and you can do it in a better way than you can in an offline classroom. When we first created our platform at Minerva, which is limited to 19 students per course, every student is on live video, we went to the University of Washington Medical School and we tested a very rudimentary version of our platform with a live class offline and a live class online, taught by the same professor, the same subject matter. The results were universally accepted that the online class was far superior to the offline class simply for the fact of the matter that even though there were the same number of students in the class, when you look straight into that camera and the professor sees your face and all of the other students see your face, you are paying attention. The professor can call on students and ask them a question and find out what they're going to answer rather than having them ask or answer at random. So the professor can choose to pick not the right answer but the spectacularly wrong answer which is interesting, one that curates the course of the conversation in ways that simply are not possible offline. What we all have to remember is we are at the dawn of interactive, high quality, personalized education, whether it's a broadcast to many, whether it's in a small seminar format, or whether it is done in an individualized adaptive learning platform that caters the process of education to the individual student. But the fact that we are at the dawn means that none of us in this room, including Anant and myself, who are working on this every day, can conceive where this will bring us in the future. Here's what we do know. We do know that when students are given the option of going to their illustrious lectures, even at the world's best universities, there are far more students on the first day of class than there are on the last day. We know that oftentimes when we ask students, Did the courses that you took in your college career change your life? Did they make an impactful change in the way you perceive the world? majority of students say, No. We know that technologies will continue to improve and will bring intellectual development of students not just among the elite but among students around the world to a newer and higher level. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you so much everybody for being here and to my copanelists for just presenting. Anant, I tried really hard to get my assignments back to my students really fast. I really try my best and I always make it in under two weeks, but now I'm going to try even harder. I really appreciate Jonathan. He brought up the fact that in person I like to teach classes where you can't get the answers in the back of the book. In my class there is no back of the book or the back of the book is just the last chapter of the book. It wouldn't really help. And, Ben, I did not know I made $400,000 a year  To be honest. I teach two classes a year and I make $14,000 a year. So, I don't know. I’m doing it wrong. All right. So what I want to talk to you guys about is the MOOC I'm taking right now. I’m taking MOOC with edX and you sign up with edX. They ask you why you're signing up and I wrote definitely not for opposition research for the debate I'm going to do. I didn't say that. It's called Think 101X the science of everyday thinking with two good professors from Australia. Actually, I love it. It's great. It's really fun. I've learned all sorts of different nefarious ways my own brain goes behind my back to thwart me. I love it. It's fantastic. It's pretty easy. It doesn't take too much time. I've learned a lot. Should I go over there? But I'm a 37 year old American with a doctorate. I already know how to learn. I learn for fun. I do it as a hobby, and it's a great hobby for me as a dabbler, but I don't think that it is an adequate replacement for college yet. There are a lot of reasons for this, but the number one reason for this is really just one word and that word is contact. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you'll vote no on the motion: More Clicks, Fewer Bricks: The Lecture Hall is Obsolete, because more clicks means less contact, less contact with professors like me. I'm not a superstar. I'm not a celebrity. I'm not a millionaire. I don't even have tenure and I never will. But that doesn't matter to my students. I'm going to talk a little bit about some of my students today. I have one student who lives with dyslexia, and she is so smart in class. She's just bright in class, but her written work really suffers. And if she were taking an online course she might be mistaken quite unfairly for somebody who was not as bright as she is or drunk maybe, I don't know, but the fact that we can actually talk to each other in class has changed her life, because she knows that I know how smart she is. I have another student who is so shy that he shook last semester in class. Whenever I called on him  I have ways of getting students to pay attention, by the way. He shook when I called on him. He gave presentation and he actually stopped halfway through because he went so clammy. Two weeks ago he came in, second semester, same class, Dostoyevsky killed it. Did such a great job. Blew us all away and I was talking to him about his story because I wanted to use it today, and he said I want you to know that our class has helped me learn how to talk to people. The importance of that cannot be overstated. It has helped him learn how to talk to people. So, people, my students, actual real people, I know them. They know me. I don’t just enter their lives with the dissemination of content. They enter mine and we connect, we make contact. And that's important when things are going well in class. It’s even more important when things are going poorly. The community college research center right here at Columbia did a multiyear study where they determined that when students at community colleges and other sort of nonprestige institutions are struggling and they're taking classes online, they're much more likely to fail. They're much more likely to drop out. They're much more likely to give up. So I urge you to vote no on this motion: More Clicks, Fewer Bricks, because with every click a student loses contact. With every click the student loses opportunities for growth. With every click the student might even lose their future. So right now students aren’t just failing online classes in enormous numbers, although they are. Online classes are also failing them. I have a lot more to say on this, but I'd like to transition to discuss, but while I am I'm going to be thinking about my students who all waived their right to privacy for me to be able to shout out to them today. So I hope that like me you'll be thinking of Miranda and Emma and Alex and Alex and Sarah, Sarah, and Sarah, Kayla, Amanda, Katrina, Megan, Braxton, Andy, Dick, Sandy, another Rebecca, not me, Josh, Jake and James, Taylor, Ryan, Elden and Ethan, Josie, and Dimitri. I think that they deserve contact. I think they deserve devoted personal attention. MOOCs are great for dabbling, and they're great for supplementary education, but I don't think they're a substitute for human interaction. The Minerva Project sounds fascinating, and I heard that you were hiring. You probably pay more than I make. But no matter how advanced software is, I still don't think that it can replace face to face and being in the same room. Interaction is the most important part of college. It can be the difference between success and failure. And because of that, I urge you to vote no today on the motion, More clicks, fewer bricks: The lecture hall is obsolete. Thank you."

    "data": "Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Of course, Russia matters. It can't not matter. It's the largest country in the world by land mass. It's a $2 trillion economy, and it's a super power, not only a nuclear superpower but a cultural, scientific and linguistic one. The question is how to use that great potential. Does it maximize it in the mainstream of world affairs, or does it squander it on the sidelines? And it's my contention that Russia squanders its potential under the rule of Vladimir Putin. Now, we had great hopes 25 years ago in those glorious days when Peter and I were covering the collapse of the evil empire, that freed from the burden of communism, of the burden of imperial history, that Russia would take its rightful place as a great power in the mainstream world affairs. And it didn't happen. Now, I disagree with Peter. I don't think that we imposed something on Russia in the '90s. I think the Russian leadership squandered those chances with a mixture of corruption, spectacular corruption, nostalgia and paranoia, and it's got worse and worse as it's gone on. What has Russia got now to contribute to the great problems that are facing us? What does Russia have in the way of a constructive original solution on the law of the sea, space, climate change, internet freedom, development, world trade system, reforming world finance, ethics of medical research, or on security? What's it have to say about the Middle East? About wars in Africa, about how East Asia should cope with a rising China? I just ask my opponents if they can think of one constructive original contribution that Russia has made to these questions. It'd be great if they'd like to declare it because it's very easy to know what Russia's against. Russia's against the EU. It's against NATO. It's against modern [unintelligible] organizations in general. It's against the West. So we know what Russia's against, but we don't know what Russia's for. Now, you may say, well, what Russia is for is sovereignty. It believes in the principle of nonintervention, and that's why it stands by and blocks sanctions against  any sanctions against Syria that might have some effect on the terrible conflict there. But it's not consistent in this. It doesn't practice what it preaches. It's strongly against intervention when it comes to the West. But it's in favor of intervention, in fact, it loves intervention when it comes to the captive nations of the empire, perhaps the one countries that from all they suffered under Soviet rule, it should treat with the greatest sensitivity and respect. Now, I believe in principle that intervention is sometimes right. I think we should have intervened in Rwanda, for example, to stop the genocide. But I think it was a high buy. You have to produce some evidence if you're going to intervene, evidence of real human rights abuses. There's no other way of an intervention to try and solve them. But Russia hasn't done that in Ukraine. Russia hasn't produced any evidence at all. It asserts things, but it hasn't invoked international human rights organizations, it hasn't tried to negotiate with the Ukrainian government. Its intervention in Ukraine is decried by the very people it aims to help. We have the Russian Philological Society in eastern Ukraine appealing to Putin to hold back. We have all the Jewish organizations and all the chief rabbis writing an open letter to Putin saying, please don't do this. So he doesn't produce evidence. He doesn't produce arguments. He doesn't like engaging with the mainstream of the way the world works because he knows those arguments are phony, and the evidence is empty, and his chances are slim. I'd just like to  as my opponents over there have been rather silent, to give them another question. Can you name one European country, one democracy that thinks what Russia is doing is right. In fact, okay, further, can you name one real friend that Russia has, a country that is friends with Russia because it wants to be, not because it has to be. So don't count Tajikistan, which has Russian troops on its territory. Don't count Armenia, which was armtwisted into abandoning its deal with the European Union. Don't count Belarus which was strangled with the gas pipeline. Name a normal country, a country name a country, a country which actually says, yes, Russia, we share your views. We like you. Please don't mention Bashir Assad in Syria or Venezuela. Name a respectable country that is actually  that actually likes Russia and says, Good job, Vladimir, we really like it. Russia is a marginal power, and it's marginalized itself. It's not the West. We showered Yeltsin's Russia with money. Misfit, stolen and wasted, but we tried. We brought Russia into the G8. We set up the NATO Russia council. We brought Russia into the European security architect, the council of Europe, the OSC, all these organizations. And it hasn't worked because Russia doesn't want to be in the mainstream. Russia doesn't like having responsibilities. It doesn't like having rules. It doesn't like respecting other countries' rights. It likes doing things its own way, and that's a terrible misfortune for Russia's neighbors, and it's a terrible misfortune for the  for the people of Russia. Now, I don't want to intrude too much on private grief, but I'd just like to ask you to share  spare a thought for a moment for our opponents here, because they would love to believe that Putin had done something right, that maybe he'd sort of modernized Russia, he'd sort of stabilized Russia. He'd maybe repaired Russia's infrastructure, that he'd made Russia a power that could be respected, and it hasn't happened. The Putin years have been 14 years of terrible missed opportunity. More than a trillion dollars of excess oil and gas revenues came flooding into the coffers of the Russian federation. At the end of it, you still can't drive from one end of Russia to the other. But who's to blame for that? Not the West, not the outside world. You have to blame the crooks, the thugs, the spooks and the cronies who have been misruling Russia, losing of tens of billions dollars a year, sometimes I admit with our complicity, laundered in the city of London, in Austria, maybe even New York, who knows? It's been a catastrophe. We should not approach this debate in some kind of tale of sneering triumphalism. It's not that we're pleased that Russia's on the sidelines. It's a tragedy. We need Russia to be playing a role in the mainstream of world policies, in the mainstream of world affairs, and it's not happening. One day maybe it will. But for the time being, ladies and gentlemen, Russia is a marginal power."

    "data": "Well, good evening, or dobryy vecher as they say in the Kremlin. I feel a bit underdressed for this occasion. I haven't brought my order of the Red banner, but I'm sure Edward will have ordered me one by the end of the evening. All right. Edward and I hugely enjoyed the Cold War. I enjoyed particularly as an ex Trotskyist, I loathed the Soviet regime from that point of view, and then later on as a fervent Cold Warrior and a genuine believer in the truth that the Soviet Union was an evil empire. It was an evil empire. There's no question about it. And anybody who doubts it should have seen what I saw. But the problem of enjoying the Cold War and if we’d like to get a party together to go and put the Berlin wall up again tonight, I'll be at the head of it because it was, in many ways, extremely enjoyable for journalists and a wonderful moment in which we all knew which side we were on. Enjoying the Cold War as much as we did as a pleasure is that we forget that we ought to look upon it in one or two other rather important ways. There was a very, very important moment in the early years of Mikhail Gorbachev when he was dismantling the Soviet Union, when he came under attack from a group of American conservative journalists who kept on saying, We don't believe this. We don't believe that you're doing to the Soviet Union what we say that you are. And he just sat there smiling silkily as he did. And eventually he said, Gentlemen, I'm terribly sorry. We have done to you the worst thing, the most unkind thing we could possibly have done to anybody. We have deprived you of an enemy. And this was what happened in 1991. We were deprived of an enemy. I was in Moscow on that lovely sunny Monday morning in August 1991. I came out of my block of flats, my neighbors were the Brezhnev family and the Andropov family. I came out of my block of flats, onto my street, [unintelligible] Prospect, and down the street were coming tanks, in the slanting sunshine, with their barrels pointing towards the center of Moscow, rolling down, kicking up dust, a very strangely moving sight. And I saw Moscow through all the following days as [unintelligible] collapsed utterly. And one particular scene is burned upon my memory, and that is this, that in every trashcan in the city, every single trashcan was full to the brim of communist party membership cards burning. It was over. There was no question in my mind that it was over. This was not the Soviet Union, it was Russia. A year later, I was allowed to go into the closed city, as it then was, of Sevastopol, to see what was left of the Soviet navy, Admiral Gorshkov's great global blue water navy, the principal instrument of power projection of the Soviet Union, in its struggle for mastery of the planet with the United States. And in every creek and inlet around Sevastopol were sunken ships, ships downed by the bow, ships downed by the stern, ships canting over at degree  at 45 degrees, abandoned, wrecked, finished, over, dead, gone. So we have the communist party gone, and we have the world power gone. And then we have this extraordinary era in which I'm afraid Edward has been a little bit, how shall I say, kind, to the West, in which we said to the Russians that, We must now have in Russia democracy, and we must now have capitalism. And we indeed showered them with money and stupid advice, paying very little attention to what that country really needed, which was the rule of law and liberty. And that whole era is now known to most Russians who lived through it when it was a time of debauched currency, hopeless, terrible corruption, misery and theft, the loss of their homes, the loss of their jobs, the wiping out of their savings overnight. They refer to it  you'll know the Russians, their democracy is  demokratiya [spelled phonetically]. They refer to it as dermokratiya, which I will translate politely as the rule of excrement. That is the view of most Russians of what they went through. I will end with another reminiscence because this is very important in understanding why it is that Russia now so very much desires to be left alone. The other reminiscence is in my first week in Moscow, I went to a film being shown in the Cosmos [spelled phonetically] Cinema. And it was a film called, [unintelligible], which means approximately, We can't go on living like this. It was made by a man called Stanislav Govorukhin, who was a great friend of Alexander Solzhenitsyn. And it went through in great detail  and it's a disgrace that no Western cinema and no Western TV stations ever shown this film because it's so graphic  it went through in great detail the horrible misery, corruption, oppression, and lies of the Soviet Union. And I became aware as I sat watching this that everybody in the cinema was weeping. For the first time, they had been allowed to see in detail the truth about the disastrous country in which they'd been living. Now what they want is actually to be left alone, to be Russia, a country which will exist whatever you do to it. You might as well try and remove the Himalayas with a teaspoon as to remove Russia from the international, diplomatic, or military, or economic landscape. It simply is not going to go away. And to pretend that it will and to impose on it Carthaginian treaties, when its territory is taken away and it's pushed up to the same borders, imposed on it by Keiser Wilhelm in 1918 is not going to work. But the thing to remember about that film is that during the last election in which Vladimir Putin won, one of his key supporters was Stanislav Govorukhin, friend of Solzhenitsyn. And he said, I'm supporting Putin because under Yeltsin we had disgusting hopeless misery and debauchery. Under Vladimir Putin we have normal corruption. And that was not a feeling which was unshared by millions and millions of Russians. He spoke for them. When Putin was elected, it wasn't entirely undemocratic. I [unintelligible] a very simple point here. Here we are in a country which has the Pacific Ocean on one side, the Atlantic Ocean on the other, Mexico at the bottom, and Canada at the top. Now, just imagine for a moment that you didn't have that, you had Germany on side and China on the other and Japan breathing down your neck, and that you didn't have a gigantic global navy or an enormous amount of physical wealth, but you actually had to cope with the fact that you had dangerous neighbors, you might be less concerned with fanciful global ideas of wonderful global international cooperation, and you might be more concerned with the simple straightforward issue of whether you could survive defensibly as a country, a society, an economy, and a culture. You would be closer to the truth than you are here in this extraordinary, wonderfully protected paradise. Ladies and gentlemen, Russia is not a marginal power. Please do vote against this motion. It is a very foolish motion indeed."

    "data": "So let me start by saying I'm sympathetic to much of what Peter said. I certainly agree that the United States was not trying to rebuild Russia after the Cold War was over the way we did Japan and Europe with MacArthur and the Marshall plan. Shock therapy, NATO enlargement, energy diversification, those things that we actually did didn't help Russia, they weakened Russia. Okay, let's remember what this debate is about. The debate is about  not about Are we sympathetic with Russia's position? I'm very sympathetic with Russia's position. They're just losing, right? They're  if we had helped them a lot, they might still be a great power. Maybe, it's possible, they lost a lot. They had little legitimacy, but they might have  they'd be in better shape. Peter and I clearly agree on this. The problem is he's debating the other side, right? What we're debating is that Russia's not a great power, it's a marginal power. I decided to look something up in the dictionary before I got here. Marginal, what's the definition of marginal? It was Not of central importance, limited in extent, significance or stature. I look at global politics today. I look at the economy. Russia isnot a great power. It is a marginal power, and it's becoming more marginal by the day. I had a discussion with David Miliband, the ex British foreign secretary just a few weeks ago, and there was a question from the audience as to why it was that British relations with Russia had gotten to be so poor. And he said, Well, you see, the Brits believe that Russia is in decline, and Russia believes that Britain is in decline, and we are both correct. That's where we are. Oh, look, I agree with Peter as well that Putin is a sinister tyrant. Do I think that Russia really wants that? No, no, I don't. Certainly they like a little less sinister. They understand that leadership needs to be strong, but less sinister. Anticorruption? The Russians themselves did a poll on this in the last couple months, 5 percent of Russians believe that the anticorruption policies of Putin were in any way effective. They'd like them to be a little bit more effective. They would. You know, 110 Russians presently control 35 percent of Russia's household wealth. We have  we talk about inequality in the United States. The Russians actually get it right, right? 0.0000007 percent of Russians control 35 percent of the country's household wealth. Look, it is a big country. They don't have many people on it , it's a big country, right? I mean, Palin can see them from her house  you know, Putin can see Alaska from his house. Alaska doesn't have much sway in the bottom 48, right? It's big. They've got a lot of resources. They don't have many people, right? We're not excited about Alaska. I apologize if you're from Alaska, but we don't care. The problem is what’s Russia doing with all of that land? What’s  what are you doing with all of that potential? I’ll tell you what they’re not doing is fixing their economy. There have been a lot of companies out there that have thought about investing big in Russia. IKEA used to make more money per square meter in Russia than anywhere else in the world in the early 90s. They’ve pulled back. Why? Because folks came in. They said, Oh, you’ve got environmental problems. Under your parking lot, there’s a gas line. You’re going to have to pay us an awful lot. We won’t do that. Oh, I guess we’ll shut down IKEA for a bit. WalMart thought about it for four years, decided not to invest. WalMart wants to be everywhere. They’re your bigbox, lowcost leader. They’re all over China. That’s not an easy place to invest. They’re not in Russia. Toyota, $28 million in St. Petersburg because the Russians desperately wanted them  the Japanese to work with them. Koizumi brought over the chairman and CEO. Said, Let’s do this. They said, We’ll test it out, and if it goes well a few years later, we’ll make Russia the base of manufacturing for the entire Eurasia region. Have they expanded? Absolutely not. Everything walked out the door, right? Economics  we have to say economics matter, right? We can’t just pretend that it  that it’s not important. Geopolitics  here, let me go back to my friend Edward here. You’re right. Tajikistan, Armenia, Belarus  that is not a portfolio you want. Snowden  the Chinese handled Snowden well. They said, Let’s get him. Let’s bring him over. We’ll grab all of his stuff. We’ll learn some stuff about how the American’s are spying on us. And then, we’ll send him somewhere. And Russia said, Me, me, me. Let’s have him. And the Russians grab him. They said, We’ll take all the stuff. And then, we’ll send him to Cuba. Oh, we didn’t think that through very well. They don’t want to keep him. It became a problem. They didn’t think it through very well. Again, feather in Putin’s cap. It’s great. He can swan around. Feather in Putin’s cap. $51 billion on Sochi. What did that do for the average Russian? How’s that done for Russia in the world? It’s been a problem. Ukraine is the most important national security interest that Russia has outside of their country. The average Russian believes that Ukraine has been a part of it for 300 years. The Americans and the Europeans didn’t care. Yanukovych wanted aid from the Americans and Europeans so that he could balance the Russians off against the Europeans. And we said, Sorry, not it. We’ve got other things to take care of. And so, then, Putin said, I’ll write you a check for 15 billion out of our pension fund. And, you know what? The Ukrainian people said, We don’t care. We don’t want the money. We’ll demonstrate. We’ll die in the streets, rather than have to live under that. That’s Ukraine. We’re not talking about Germany. We’re not talking about Indonesia. These are the people that speak Russian and Ukrainian together. So, they’ll have Crimea. They will take Crimea. We told them, Red line. We told lots of  we told the Syrians, Red line. They stepped over it. Does that mean that they are a great power? Syria? It does not. Are the Russians a great power? They are not. Let me just end a couple other economic bits. How big are the Russians today, economically, compared to China? Chinese economy is more than four times larger. That’s pretty  talk about the BRICs, as if they’re all places that you would think about with equal importance. The Russians are losing out in their backyard because of the Chinese imposing their will increasingly economically dominating central Asia, because that’s where all the investments are going to come from. East Siberia, because the Chinese are demographically swamping Russia there. The Russians are concerned about that. There’s no question in my mind that if we look at the future for Russia geopolitically, geoeconomically, demographically, this is not a great power. We all wish it were. It’d be better for them. It’d be better for the world. But, it’s not. And I think you should vote, as a consequence, with us, and for the motion. Thank you."

    "data": "Good evening. Skillful debaters, when they have a weak case to make, change the subject. So, let’s remember what the subject is. It is not, Is Russia a responsible member of the international community? No, it’s not. It isn’t, Does Russia have friends? No, it’s not. It isn’t, Would you vote Vladimir Putin to be your church deacon? The answer is no. And finally, it is not, Is Russia a great power? That is not the subject of this debate. The subject of this debate is, Is Russia a marginal power? And, as our colleague mentioned, this means a country with very little impact on the international system, and very little consequence for the United States. So, I’m going to quickly go through why I believe that’s deeply mistake. So, first, Russia, today, is the only country on mother earth that can destroy the United States as we know it in 30 minutes. It has 1,500 nuclear weapons on hair trigger aimed at America’s cities. No other country could have the effect on the United States of Russia. It has 10,000 nuclear weapons. Think Hiroshima. Think Nagasaki  100,000 people died. And think 10,000 nuclear weapons. Second, the United States and Russia possess 95 percent of all nuclear weapons on the planet. And let me just quote one of my favorite senators, if not my favorite senator, Diane Feinstein: We have a chance to wind down and expedite the removal of 96 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons. What an achievement it would be we could say that the nuclear arsenals of both Russia and the United States have been reduced to the barest minimums. That cannot be done without Moscow. And it’s hardly the example of a marginal county. Third, nuclear terrorist  something that, of course, this great city is preoccupied with, because it would be one of the principle targets if a nuclear weapon got into the hands of terrorists. Since the end of the Cold War that we’ve been discussing, the two countries that possess most of the weapons, including Russia, have lost not one single loose nuke. And that has a major impact, potentially, on your lives. Fourth, Russia works with the United States to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons and missiledelivery systems. Is their record perfect? No, it’s not. But they are deeply involved in the negotiations we are having  we, Americans, are having with Iran on the future of the Iranian nuclear weapons program, and on our efforts to cap the North Korean nuclear program. Sixth, Russia today is a vital lifeline for the 40,000 American troops that remain in Afghanistan. We could not supply our courageous men and women in Afghanistan fighting that war without the socalled northern route through Russia. And this is largely because of our problems with Pakistan, but it’s absolutely indispensable to the safety and security of American troops in Afghanistan. The U.N. Security Council  Russia is a permanent member. And, if you care about international law, and if you care about the United States acting abroad in the context of international law  that is to say through security council resolutions  that cannot happen unless Russia supports that. And we can all remember of actions the U.S. has taken the last 15 years which couldn’t command the unanimous vote of the U.N. permanent members, and which, you’ll remember, didn’t go all that well. Of course, as it’s been mentioned, Russia’s the largest country in the world. An eighth of the earth’s surface in this extraordinary country. It is the ninth most populous country in the world. It’s not a small country  150 million people or so. If Russia is a marginal power, what’s a nonmarginal power? Do our debating colleagues think only the United States is not a marginal power? And, finally, the environment  the environment. Russia emits onequarter of all the carbon emissions on the globe. How can we say it’s marginal when it has that effect on the environment? I conclude with Ukraine. Our colleagues argue that Russia is a marginal country. Do you think the Ukrainians who just lost a part of their country the size of Massachusetts through the intervention of Russian military forces believe it’s marginal? Is that why the President of the United States has spent a total of five hours speaking with the Russian president in the last 10 days to try persuade the Russian president to withdraw those forces. Is that why the American president this afternoon saw the Ukrainian prime minister? Could that have happened? Would that be happening if Russia were a marginal power? Woody Allen once bragged  resident of this city  once bragged that he'd taken a 20minute speed reading course, and read one piece in 20 minutes. And somebody asked him, what was it about? And he says, It was about Russia. I think that our colleagues debating for this motion have taken a strategic speedreading course to come to the conclusion that Russia is a marginal power. Thank you."

Now, while formal declarations of war have not occurred since World War II, major military operations, such as the Gulf War, the 2001 Afghan War, and 2003 in Iraq  all only happened after the executive was authorized to use military force by large bipartisan majorities of both houses of Congress. Now, the AUMF  the authorization to use military force  in 2001, which is the basis for President Obama's continued use of his warmaking power against AlQaeda and associated forces  our opponents will say, was only directed at those that participated in or planned 9/11. However, since that time, the judiciary, in the line of habeas cases from Guantanamo, has determined that the scope of that authority actually is AlQaeda and associated forces. The thinking behind this is that when you're dealing with an enemy like AlQaeda, that is diffuse, that is splintered, you are not going to require the president to return to Congress for authorization every time a new group with a new name shows up in a new location  as long as they are still trying to kill Americans in this country or kill American troops and contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Further, since that judicial gloss has been placed upon the scope of the authorization, Congress  the Senate Armed Services Committee  held hearings last year on whether the AUMF should be revised, repealed, or retained. And at the conclusion of those hearings, they left it as it was and so, at least implicitly, have accepted the scope of the authorization that the judiciary has put on this. Now, once the executive has received the authorization to use military force from Congress, it is then the exclusive province of the executive branch to determine when, where, and how that war is fought. Congress tells him who we are declaring war on. We declare a war on Germany, he can't go fight France. But it is up to him how he fights Germany, where he fights Germany, who he targets. That is exclusive executive decisionmaking. And no other branch has any constitutional basis for challenging that decisionmaking. And this is true, even when we are talking about targeting Americans. During World War II, the United States Armed Forces killed a number of American citizens that were members of the German and Japanese armies. But in today's war, we are being told that although those people  the Germans and Japanese that we killed without questioning whether we were invading or infringing upon their due process rights. We're told that today, because our enemy doesn't wear uniforms, doesn't carry arms openly, hides amongst the civilian population and uses human shields, in other words, because they undermine all of the basic tenets of the laws of war, that they should be afforded due process rights that an American putting on a German uniform does not have. Now, the president does have a duty, under international law, to distinguish between targetable individuals and civilians. But he does not have a duty under either international law or the U.S. Constitution to distinguish between targetable Americans and targetable nonAmericans. And as my partner will argue, such a distinction would be immoral. Now, you will hear our opponents argue that this authority of the executive is geographically bounded by hot battlefields. You can only use this authority in hot battlefields. That is a term that does not appear anywhere in either international law or in the U.S. Constitution. And yet because internal armed conflicts have been determined to exist based upon a level of violence measure, by some commentators in some courts, they are trying to impose that view of international law on our president. However, the U.S. view of international law is consistent with that of many other nations that face nonstate actors that have committed terrorist acts against their citizens and then tried to seek sanctuary by crossing some international boundary. And just as Columbia and Turkey and Israel and even Iran reject the notion that you may gain such sanctuary, the United States also agrees that the laws of armed conflict go where the participants in the armed conflict go. And because this is an armed conflict, there are no due process rights available. Lastly, we are going to hear from our opponents that there is insufficient transparency on the part of the administration. They are not telling us enough about how they know what they know about our enemies and what they know about our enemies and why they are targeting our enemies. Now, of course, if they reveal this to the American public, they are also revealing it to our enemies. And to say that the due process rights of our enemies must be vindicated by telling our enemies what we know about them and how we know it does not  well, let me say that it is obvious why there is no constitutional requirement for such disclosures. Thank you."

    "data": "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Today the president is claiming an absolute power that would have horrified the Founding Fathers. He asserts the authority to kill American citizens without judicial review based on largely secret law, entirely secret evidence, and he asserts this power even with respect to Americans who are found far from any conventional battlefield. Noah and I are here to argue against the proposition, because the power that the president is claiming is unlawful and it is unwise. In our system of checks and balances, the president cannot be the judge, jury and executioner. Now, for very good reason, our Constitution and international law strictly limits the government's power to kill people without judicial review. In areas of actual armed conflict, under the law, the government can kill people without judicial review because of battlefield requirements. Outside that context, extra judicial killing is legal only if it is a last resort and only if its in response to a truly imminent threat. The government can't kill Americans simply because it believes that they may do something dangerous at some point far off in the future. This is a democracy. It's not Minority Report. So in every context, the Constitution, outside of armed conflict, the Constitution requires the government to prove its case to a court before it delivers a death sentence. That's because even the most serious allegations are not evidence. And due process requires evidence, not just allegations. Now, the president, and our opposition, seek to circumvent due process in ways that strike at the heart of our system of checks and balances of what it means to be a nation ruled by law, not men or women. First they want to redefine the battlefield so that it covers the globe. That's not just wrong. It's a very dangerous proposition. And Noah's going to address that more. Then they want to redefine the law. We only found out after the leak of a socalled white paper which purports to summarize stillsecret legal memos that were written to justify the killing of a U.S. citizen, Anwar alAwlaki. The white paper acknowledged that he was going to be killed outside of recognized battlefields, but argued that the killing could be lawful in response to an imminent threat. It then redefined imminence to mean its very opposite. The White House now says that it can order the killing of an American it suspects may some day present a threat even without evidence of an actual plot. This is a radical reinterpretation of the law. What should trouble us as much as these legal shenanigans is that the actual full standards for killing Americans far from any battlefield are still secret. The government refuses to disclose to us its killing memos. Was Anwar alAwlaki truly an imminent threat? The only way to find out would be for President Obama's Justice Department to present its evidence to a court. This the government refuses to do. Instead, the Justice Department has made a profoundly disturbing argument and claim. It said that the courts have no role to play in deciding whether alAwlaki's killing, far from a battlefield, was lawful. Now, you may hear a lot tonight from the other side about why we need to trust the government when it comes to national security and threats. But one of the core lessons of the last decade is that trust us is never enough when the government claims power over life and liberty. Do you remember when the Bush administration claimed that the people at Guantanamo were all terrorists, the worst of the worst? Remember when President Bush's Justice Department fought for years to prevent any judicial review of those claims ultimately without success? And do you remember what happened next? As the courts finally started reviewing the Bush administration's claims, it turned out that more often than not, the evidence that the government relied on was overstated, it didn't exist, or it was just plain wrong. The result was that the Bush administration itself released the majority of people at Guantanamo. When a president wrongly detains people, there's always the possibility of judicial review and release. There is no appeal from a drone strike. Many Americans were outraged when President Obama claimed worldwide authority to detain people, suspected terrorists, without charge or trial. We should be similarly outraged when President Obama claims something far more radical: The power, worldwide, to kill people the government unilaterally deems its enemies. Now, our concern here tonight isn't just for citizens. Four Americans have been killed in the targeted killing program. But thousands more noncitizens are dead. Several hundreds of these were far from any battlefield. They include a grandmother, for example, who was picking vegetables in her garden. And there are many more horrific accounts of similar tragedies and wrongful deaths. It isn't surprising then that military leaders warn that President Obama's lethal program is creating more enemies than it kills. Unlawful killings will never lead to security no matter how many of them our government commits. Think about the world we're creating. If the U.S. can carry out targeted killings in Yemen and Pakistan, why can't the Russians, the Chinese and Iranians do the same, Russia in Kiev, London or Washington, D.C.? This is not the world that we want to live in. And Noah and I hope you agree with us and vote no to the motion. It's a proposition that is unAmerican, unlawful and unwise. Thank you."

    "data": "Under the precise motion before this house, our opponents have the extraordinarily heavy burden of showing that under no circumstances should the commanderinchief ever have the authority to order the targeting of dangerous terrorists—regardless of how imminent the threat may be, how impossible it would be to capture him—if that enemy happens to have been born in the United States or naturalized as an American citizen. Consider the implications of that extreme position. It would mean that if Osama bin Laden had been born in America, had been planning the attacks on 9/11, were targeted, it was impossible to arrest him, and the only way to stop him from carrying out 9/11 would be to subject him to a drone attack, under the negative of the resolution, the president would lack that authority. That just makes no sense at all. Of course what they're going to try to do now is try to modify their extreme position by saying that the president would be authorized under certain circumstances, they've already conceded in the battlefield if it's an American, they've already conceded apparently if the judiciary agrees, so they've already undercut their proposition considerably. But consider the implications even of their modified position. It would mean that unelected judges unfamiliar with the situation on the ground and inexpert at making intelligence assessment and operational decisions could prevent the commanderin chief from taking action designed to protect Americans from terrorist attacks—even if such preventive action would be entirely lawful under both American and international law—if the people happen to have been American citizens. This is not Minority Report. These are cases where there is clear evidence that somebody in the past has joined al Qaeda or its affiliates, has been an operational leader of alQaeda, and has participated in the planning of operations against the United States. That's not Minority Report. Our opponents argue that a terrorist commander planning an imminent attack on the United States that can only be prevented by a drone attack has a constitutional due process right to a judicial predetermination. But consider the following relevant analogy: what if an American citizen wearing a Tshirt emblazoned with his passport on one side and the American flag on the other took a series of hostages? You don't even have to imagine it. Just consider if Timothy McVeigh instead of killing so many children in Oklahoma City had taken them hostage, and let's assume that he had said, I'm not going to kill anybody for 48 hours until I complete the negotiation, but during that 48hour period a sharpshooter was able to target him, not knowing exactly when he might start killing Americans. Would anybody in their right mind demand a due process prejudicial determination, or would you say that the situation there permits for the use of deadly force? That's not murder. Yes, it's an extrajudicial killing, but extrajudicial killings occur all the time. Every time a fleeing felon runs away with a machine gun from a bank robbery, even though the bank robbery's complete, just on the basis of the possibility they may do it again, the United States Supreme Court has definitively ruled that deadly force may be used without violating his due process rights and without a predetermined judicial authority. In fact, the Supreme Court, just two days ago, heard a case on that issue, and the report in the New York Times said none of the justices gave any attention to the claim that it would be a due process violation in shooting a fleeing felon under those situations. Of course mistakes are made. There are  mistakes are made with fleeing felons, and of course every effort should be made to reduce the number of casualties. Some of the people referred to by my distinguished opponent were accidentally killed, including the son. He wasn't targeted. When you drop bombs people are accidentally killed. It's especially the case when terrorists make the decision to hide among civilians. They make the decision to violate the rules of law, the rules of warfare, and, as the result, the only option put to a democracy is to use the drone in the most targeted possible way, knowing that there might be some collateral damage and civilian casualties or allow the terrorists to continue. There should not be a distinction drawn between terrorists who are American citizens and terrorists who are not, except, of course, if they're captured, in which case being an American citizen makes it worse because it's treason. But if they're not captured, if they're on the battlefield, once one signs up to become an alQaeda operative, his or her citizenship does not and should not matter. The important distinction is not between Americans and nonAmericans, but rather between combatants and civilians. All AlQaeda operatives are unlawful combatants. That is, they are subject to being targeted as combatants, because they've joined AlQaeda, because they are at war with the United States. But they are not entitled to the benefits of being legitimate combatants because they do not comply with the rules of warfare. So, just use your common sense and ask yourself the question  does the Constitution really straight jacket the CommanderinChief of the United States Armed Forces? Does it really deny him the constitutional power to prevent an act of terrorism just because the person planning the act of terrorism is an American citizen? I urge you to vote that the president has such power to protect you and your children. Thank you."

    "data": "When I was a kid, I really liked to argue. And my parents told me that I should grow up and I should defend civil liberties, like Alan Dershowitz. I don't think they thought  and I know I didn't think  that I would eventually have to defend civil liberties from Alan Dershowitz  But that seems to be where we are. We're on hallowed ground here. Those of you who live in Philadelphia are accustomed to invocations of the Constitution and its importance. But for those of us who are visitors, it's not a trivial thing to come from the airport, get out of the taxi, and see Independence Hall, where the most basic principles of liberty were set down for the United States. And indeed, the Framers believed, that by demonstration, they were setting down those principles of liberty for the whole world. That matters, and it ought to matter to us in thinking about this issue, because it pushes us to ask what's really the most fundamental question you could ask about the nature of liberty and democratic government: What is the essence of liberty? What's it all for? Why do we even have a constitution? And if you boil that down to its deepest essence, the most fundamental component of liberty, going back to Magna Carta, which is 1215  if you're counting. Not the time 12:15. The year 1215. The essence of Magna Carta  the thing that was demanded from King John of England  was to promise that the government would not kill its own citizens without a trial. That's it. That's the essence of liberty. Your government can't kill you without a trial. And when we say due process, which is a fancy expression, that's all it means. That means you get a chance to explain that you didn't do it, that it wasn't you. And before that happens, they won't kill you. Now, if you are fighting at the Battle of Guadalcanal in a Japanese uniform, and you suddenly hold in the air your U.S. passport, sure, there is no doubt that in that context, the American soldier on the other side can kill you, because you are on the battlefield in a legitimate war. And to think otherwise would be preposterous. And it is, to be completely blunt, a classic debaters' trick to say that somehow, we have a radical position or that we've modified our radical position for denying that. That's just common sense. And common sense should, I insist, drive your vote in this case  though not exactly in the direction that our opponents think it ought to. Now, what is the difference between a person on the battlefield fighting in a war and an American citizen, thousands of miles from home, who is targeted by a government program? The answer is pretty simple, and there are two of them. One is, under the international law of war and under our domestic law, the threat has to be imminent. As Hina explained, imminence is  means what the word imminence sounds like it means. Imminent. About to happen. And if you read the white paper, what it says  this government document  it's nominally a description of an even more secret document   it says Imminence is not imminence. Imminence is where you might have done something in the past and you're a member of AlQaeda, and maybe you're a senior member of alQaeda, and so you might do something in the future. That's not imminence under the law, and it's not imminence under common sense. The second element is, you have to be in the war. You have to be on the battlefield. Now, the other side has said, quite honestly  and I give them a lot of credit for saying this  that in their opinion, the battlefield is anywhere. Anywhere. So you get off the plane at Heathrow, some of you probably travel every so often. You're abroad, so you're under the terms of our motion. You can be killed. Why? Because the president of the United States could determine, secretly, by a secret process, that he believes that you are affiliated with either alQaeda or some other force that he says, now, 13 years after 9/11, is affiliated with alQaeda. We'll leave aside whether you could be affiliated with an affiliated group, but there's reason to think that even that would satisfy the administration. And when that happens, you can be killed. Now, is that consistent with the idea of a declaration of war? No, it is not, because a battlefield cannot stretch forever in time and everywhere in geographical dimension. That is not war under the meaning of our Constitution. It is not war as our Founding Fathers would have recognized it. It is not war even as Congress would have intended. And it is certainly not war under the meaning of international law as is shared by people around the world. That meaning, by the way, is relevant to our Constitution, because when our Constitution talks about the declaration of war, it's referring to a concept from international law. The word war means something in our Constitution. It gets its meaning from international law. As a consequence of all this, you have to have ask yourselves, where will it end? So there's a plausible answer, which is, eventually, Congress will say the war is over. When do you think that's going to happen? When do you think it's going to be in the political interests of your elected representatives to stand up and say, you know, 9/11 happened. We fought back. The war against terror is over, and we hereby  what, peace treaty? There's not going to be a peace treaty. So I think it's quite realistic to expect that from the standpoint of Congress, and therefore from the standpoint of the executive, they're never going to end this war. And the same goes for geographical range. They're never going to say they can't kill you. If that bothers you, you should vote no on the proposition."

    "data": "Thank you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Rick and I are here to make a very narrow point, race preferential admissions policies are doing far more harm than good. The very large preferences that are now routinely employed by colleges and universities produce fewer, not more, black scientists, black engineers, and black medical doctors. They produce fewer black college professors and very likely fewer black lawyers. We are talking epic policy failure. Before I get too far, let me say that we are not here to argue against outreach, outreach is not the source of the problem, nor are we here to argue that colleges and universities should consider only academic indicators like the SAT in evaluating applicants. There are lots of ways to measure talent, though I would say that race is not one of them. But let me get back to my main point. Race preferential policies don't work. How can that be? How can giving minorities a friendly leg up produce fewer minority professionals? Well, let me explain. One consequence of widespread race preferential policies is that underrepresented minorities end up distributed among colleges and universities in patterns very different from their white and asian counterparts. When the highest school on the academic ladder relaxes academic standards in order to admit more minority students, the schools one rung down must do the same if they are to get minority students. The problem is thus passed down to the third rung on the ladder, which responds similarly. As a result, underrepresented minority students are concentrated at the bottom of most selective schools. The problem is not that there are no academically gifted minority students, but there are not currently enough at the very top tiers to satisfy the demand. And efforts to remedy that problem end up causing credentials gaps up and down the pecking order. For example, we learned in connection with the University of Michigan Supreme Court litigation a decade ago that Michigan granted preferences to underrepresented minority students equivalent to an entire letter grade. That is, AfricanAmerican and Hispanic students with a straight B, 3.0, average were treated the same as Asian and white students with a straight A, 4.0, grade point average, all other things being equal. This is no tiebreaker in otherwise close cases. The preferences are very large, and since 2003 they've gotten larger. The problem is that entering credentials matter. Students whose academic credentials are well below the average for the college and university they are attending will usually earn grades that are similar, while some students outperform their entering credentials, just as some students underperform theirs. Most students will perform in the general range that their academic credentials suggest, and anyone who thinks otherwise is engaging in wishful thinking at student expense. No serious supporter of affirmative action denies this. The strongest evidence of backfire comes from science and engineering. Contrary to what some people think, college bound AfricanAmerican and Hispanic students are just as interested as white students in majoring in science and engineering, actually a little more so, the numbers suggest. But these are difficult majors and many students of all races abandon that ambition. AfricanAmerican and Hispanic students jump ship at much, much higher rates than do whites. It's not surprising that those students, again, of any race, who give up on science and engineering disproportionately have lower entering academic credentials. But what some do find surprising and what is key to the argument that we're making this evening is that four indepth published studies by researchers at Dartmouth, the University of Virginia, and Duke, among others, and also one unpublished study so far by Rick, here, all demonstrate that part of the effect is relative. An aspiring science major who attends a school where she's in the middle or towards the top of her class in entering credentials is much more likely to persevere and ultimately succeed than is an otherwise identical student, same entering academic credentials, who attends a school where her academic credentials put her towards the bottom of the class. Put differently, preferences hurt, they don't help. The difference is not trivial, ladies and gentlemen. We would have a lot more science and engineering minority students graduating with that degree if we engaged in raceneutral admissions policies  or at least did not give so great a preference to students. A similar study by Stephen Cole and Elinor Barber shows that minority students who attend colleges, whether entering credentials put them at the bottom of the class  do not aspire to go on to graduate school and to become college professors in the same numbers as their identical  identically credentialed minority counterparts who are attending somewhat less elite schools. And the reason should be obvious. Students who get good grades in school tend to like school, in part because they correctly note that they're good at it. None of the results in any of these studies have been controversial. No one has rebutted any of it. The only mismatched study that's received any kind of criticism is Rick's initial study of law school management  law school mismatch, where data is hard to come by. But some of the very same people who criticized that study are the ones who are actively trying to prevent him from getting more, better data."

    "data": "I disagree with the proposition and ask that you vote against it. I will argue that affirmative action advances key valuable goals of most institutions of higher education in America. My partner, Theodore Shaw, will address some of the charges made against affirmative action, such as the claim that it hurts its intended beneficiaries. Let's be clear about what we defend. We defend conscious efforts to ensure the presence on our campuses of students affiliated with groups that, in the absence of special efforts, would be excluded or consigned to a negligible, isolating status. We do not feel obligated to defend all affirmative action programs across the United States. We do not support stupid affirmative action. But we do support the sensible affirmative action that has been the characteristic sort practiced on campuses across much of America Including admissions policies, that, under certain circumstances, select certain candidates over others with superior conventional credentials, such as standardized test scores and grades. Educational institutions have a wide array of goals that are advanced by affirmative action. All seek to create excellent environments for teaching and learning. Their leaders insist that racial and other sorts of diversity are essential to realizing the pedagogical mission that they envision. They maintain that racial diversity acquaints students with unfamiliar perspectives and sentiments, and that it assists in preparing students for an increasingly cosmopolitan country and demand world. This belief is held not only by academic administrators. It is also held by the executives who head many of the nation's leading business firms, the executives who submitted amicus curiae briefs to the Supreme Court several years ago in which they strenuously argued in favor of affirmative action programs on campus and convinced the court, in the words of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, that the educational benefits of diversity are not merely theoretical, but real. Some educational institutions see it as part of their mission to do what they reasonably can to assist and rectifying past racial wrongs, aware that mere cessation of invidious racial discrimination will often fail to undo the lingering effects of oppression in the past. These institutions engage in affirmative action to assist racial minority candidates who, though qualified in absolute terms, might otherwise lose out in competition for admission with those advantaged by racial or other sorts of illicit, but deeply entrenched privilege. Some educational institutions see it as part of their mission to correct or offset invidious discrimination that constitutes an invisible headwind that impedes racial minorities, women and others who still face pervasive societal bias. These institutions make special efforts to identify talent, that in the absence of affirmative action would go unrecognized or underappreciated. These programs have served to encourage students and prospective students who might otherwise have been discouraged, mistakenly believing that the monopolies of the past were unchangeable. You will hear much from our adversaries about the supposedly dysfunctional side of affirmative action. I urge you to keep in mind that affirmative action has supplied a tremendous incentive that has prompted thousands to elevate their sights and pursue ambitions that they would not have otherwise pursued. This point strikes home with me with special force because I am one among those many thousands. Some educational institutions see it as part of their mission to facilitate racial integration. They seek to do this for the purpose of making it conspicuously evident that pathways to leadership and upward mobility are accessible to all. One group that has pressed this point with notable vigor are leaders of the armed forces. They have repeatedly argued that racial diversity in the officer corps of the military is essential as a matter of national security and that at present, the military cannot achieve an officer corps that is both excellent and racially diverse unless the service academies use race conscious recruiting and admissions policies. That affirmative action supports the educational missions of institutions of higher education, that it supports their ambition to assist with the task of correcting past and present injustices, that it facilitates racial, gender, class and other sorts of needed integration is more than enough to justify its continuation. Please join with me in supporting affirmative action. Please vote against the proposition that it does more harm than good. Thank you."

    "data": "Thanks very much, John. So you've been told that truth is going to emerge from vigorous, zealous advocacy on both sides. And at my peril, I'm going to depart from that a little bit to try to suggest a little bit of a nuance because it seems to me that when we pose the question as an empirical one, is it doing more harm than good, rather than a moral one, is affirmative action right or wrong, we sort of take on the hats of social scientists. And if we're going to approach it scientifically, we need to be candid about certain things. So let me try to introduce some candor. Let's compare law school and medical school. Now, we're going to get more into the Q and A about the actual merits of law school mismatch, but assume that I might, for the moment, that if you compare two students who go to different law schools, one with large preferences to one without, the one who receives large preferences is two or three times more likely to fail the Bar exam. That event happens after the student has graduated from law school. And students who fail the bar, as one scholar put it, Are marooned. The law school is no longer interested in their fate, and they've kind of given up on them as alumni contributors. Let's compare that with medical school. Medical school, there's also something like the Bar exam. It's called the National Boards. That's taken halfway through medical school, up to the second year. If a student fails the National Boards, then at many medical schools, they're put in an academic support program. There's an effort to try to remediate and to try to help that student succeed. And there's some evidence that that works. So that means that affirmative action might be beneficial if we sort of provide the right institutional support to go with it. That generally is lacking. So that's one reason why, on balance, I think there's a harm. Another example is when we think about science mismatch, as Gail brought up. As she said, there are now four peer reviewed studies that show very clearly that if you receive a large preference into a college or university, you're 50 to 75 percent more likely to drop out of your science career on your way to getting a BA. And frequently, people drop out of college altogether. That has been shown to happen when you have a very large preference. What we don't know enough about, because we don't have enough data yet, is what happens with the small preference. Suppose the size of the preference is not equal to 300 SAT points, but the equivalent of 50 SAT points. It's possible that smaller preferences don't cause that much of a mismatch effect and that the other positive effects of affirmative action like having a more challenging atmosphere and having peers who are really talented might outweigh. So I think we need to admit that there are tradeoffs. There are balances. We're not talking about something that's completely good or completely bad. It's a mixture. So why do I think that, on balance, you should vote for the proposition? First of all, there's no longer any reasonable doubt that very large preferences have negative consequences. That's now been shown in about 20 different peerreviewed studies by over 20 different academics. And when Ted presents rebuttals in his next remark, listen carefully for when he cites peerreviewed published studies because those are the things that we're going to care about. We're going to care about studies that have gone through a process of actually being evaluated by other scholars and have been published in a reputable scholarly journal. That research overwhelmingly shows direct negative effects from largescale preferences. And when I say, Large, I mean really large. The typical beneficiary of a preference  well, the typical AfricanAmerican student at an American law school has credentials that put them at below 99 percent of the white students. So the median black student has lower credentials than 99 percent of the Anglo and Asian students. That's a large preference. Second, there have been a host of carefully done studies that have shown other sorts of really troubling side effects of affirmative action. For example, when the University of California implemented raceneutral policies after Prop 209, we saw this really interesting jump in the takeup rate by black and Hispanic students admitted to Berkeley and UCLA and some of the other elite campuses. Now, why would the enrollment rate of accepted students jump? We'd like to know more about that. But a plausible explanation is that these students found it really attractive to attend a school where neither they nor anyone else thinks that they were admitted with a racial preference. So think about the implications of that. Third, colleges and universities are locked into a pattern of institutional dishonesty. I don't think college leaders are intrinsically dishonest people, but the prevailing ideology of affirmative action makes it difficult and even hazardous for them to speak out about these issues or to really look at the effect and critically examine the effect of the programs that they're operating. To show this, consider the fact that the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, on which Gail now sits I think at least one of these reports came before Gail was on the commissiontwo reports to the commission have shown significant mismatch effects and have raised very troubling issues about it. Neither of these reports has ever been acknowledged by a higher education leader in America. There have been no task forces appointed. There's been no investigations undertaken. The reports have simply been ignored. There's a pattern of institutional unwillingness to deal with uncomfortable facts. That suggests that there's a need for reform. Finally, we have almost no transparency about what goes nonhigher education. Schools do not provide information, unless they're forced to, about their actual admissions practices. They don't provide information about outcomes. When data comes out, it's either because of a lawsuit or because someone trusted as a reliable insider decides to write about the problem. That's what I did when I got access to data on how law school preferences actually worked. So we had this pattern of problems that suggest a crying need for reform. That's why I urge you to support the opposition."

    "data": "Thank you. I urge you to vote against the proposition that affirmative action does more harm than good on campus. First, let us define what affirmative action is. It is a conscious attempt, a conscious attempt, to admit students from groups that have been underrepresented to campuses and universities at selective institutions, we can talk about preferences. We can use a lot of loaded terms, but that is the essence of affirmative action. We talk about harm. What kind of harm are we talking about and to whom? This discussion has proceeded  this debate has proceeded focusing almost exclusively on AfricanAmerican students on campus, which echoes the reality  the continuing reality in our country, which is that most of the heat when it comes to issues of race is felt along that traditional blackwhite line even while the country has always been multiracial and diverse. There's lots of affirmative action that has existed and continues to exist in our colleges and universities quite aside from the issues of race impacting AfricanAmericans. Of course, historically there was a great deal of affirmative action in this country for white males. Even today, although almost no one talks about it, there is affirmative action for males generally because women in many instances are outperforming men academically. And colleges and universities concerned about having gender balance on campuses have quietly placed a thumb on the scale when it comes to male applicants. There are differences between performances on standardized tests and in GPA for that matter among ethnic and racial groups that we don't talk about a whole lot. Generally speaking, white students are being outperformed by Asian and AsianAmerican students on standardized tests. Does that mean that white students who are not admitted to institutions of higher education because they  or they should not be admitted, rather, because they are being outperformed? No. Colleges and universities don't simply take students in rank order and admit them solely on the basis of test scores and GPA. No one talks about stigma being visited upon women who have been beneficiaries of conscious efforts to open up opportunities in higher education. No one talks about stigma being visited upon white students who may have lower GPAs than AsianAmerican students or lower test scores. The only stigma conversation is the stigma with respect to AfricanAmericans, people of color but particularly AfricanAmericans. And I submit to you that that fact reflects that we continue to struggle even in 2014 with the ageold rumors of intellectual inferiority of AfricanAmericans. Some people won't say it, but I submit that those rumors persist. Now, there are tremendous differences between students who are educated in poverty impacted inner city urban high schools and students who attend privileged high schools. So it's important for us to understand that affirmative action, when it is done correctly  and as my colleague, Professor Kennedy, indicated, we don't support what he calls stupid affirmative action, there are instances in which it hasn't been done correctly, and I'd be glad to talk about those instances  but when it's done correctly, what we're talking about is choosing among qualified students. And the question isn't whether or not or it is solely a question of whether or not students all have the same credentials. The question is whether or not institutions can choose among qualified students, so this shouldn't be a surprise that AfricanAmerican students who attend schools that are academically challenged may not have the same criteria, nor should it be a surprise that given a long history in this country in which even today, right now as we stand here, nine out of 10 days of AfricanAmerican presence in what's now the United States has been spent under Jim Crow, segregation or slavery  shouldn't be surprised that there are still differences that we're struggling to overcome. So, mismatch theory, stigmatization  I often think about the fact that, like Professor Kennedy, I am unapologetically a beneficiary of affirmative action. Would I have felt more comfortable in the public housing project  I grew up in the Bronx  knowing that I didn't get the benefit of affirmative action, but I had my integrity intact? I don't think so."

    "data": "Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be able to share a table with a man I've admired all my life, in support of a man who I've come to admire tremendously over the last eight months. On June 7th of last year, following the publication of the first NSA stories in the Washington Post and the Guardian, but before Edward Snowden had revealed his identity to us, President Obama addressed the revelations. And he said, I welcome this debate, and I think it is healthy for our democracy. The president was right. This debate has been healthy for our democracy and for democracies around the world. In fact, it's the extraordinary global debate that Edward Snowden launched  a debate about the threat that mass surveillance poses to free societies, about how surveillance technologies have outpaced democratic controls, about whether the Internet will be an instrument of democratic liberation or authoritarian control  that provides the best answer to tonight's debate. Edward Snowden is justified because he provided to journalists and through them to us information that we had a right to know and that we had a need to know. The government had not just concealed this information, it had lied to us about it. And the debate that we've had and that we're still having would not have happened any other way. Now, in those same June 7th remarks, President Obama also defended the government's surveillance practices. He said that those practices had been blessed and approved by all three branches of government: within the executive branch, by the courts, and by the Congress. Now, in making that point, President Obama probably would have said that he was joining our opponents' table. I would respectfully submit that exactly the opposite is true. And why do I say that? I say it because the same oversight bodies that had blessed these activities in the dark have dramatically challenged them and changed course in the light. Now, all three branches of government are engaged in a historic reevaluation of the NSA's surveillance practices. And we're virtually certain to see the first new limits on intelligence surveillance since the 1970s. What a difference an informed public can make. In short, our traditional democratic oversight mechanisms failed miserably before Snowden's revelations. Now, they're doing their jobs. Let's begin with Congress. When the Guardian revealed that the NSA had been  collected the phone records of every American on a daily basis, many members of Congress expressed shock  even though that program was purportedly authorized by Section 215 of the Patriot Act. Now, there's been a lot of debate since then about whether Congress did or did not know, or what they knew or did not know. But does it really matter? Either way, this was a colossal failure of oversight. Either they knew and did nothing, or they didn't know what the NSA was doing in collecting all the Americans' information on a daily basis. Now, we're all familiar with Congress's most dramatic oversight failure. And this was in the notorious exchange between Senator Ron Wyden and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Wyden had asked, did the NSA collect any type of data on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans? Clapper's answer was, No, sir. Now, this brazen falsehood is most often described as Clapper's lie to Congress, but that's not what it was. Wyden knew that Clapper was lying. Only we didn't know. And Congress lacked the courage to correct the record  allowed us to be deceived by the Director of National Intelligence. To me, that is the very definition of failed oversight. And Edward Snowden was watching. Now, what about our courts? The court that had blessed the NSA's mass surveillance of Americans is a specialized court that meets in secret and hears only from the government. It was designed to grant warrants for foreign intelligence collection. It makes sense that such a court would hear only from the government. Over the last decade, it expanded its role to rule on the legality and constitutionality of programmatic surveillance. Judicial review of those programs amounted to a secret court upholding secret programs by secretly reinterpreting American  federal laws. Now, when groups like the ACLU tried to challenge the NSA's activities in open federal courts, an interesting thing happened. The government didn't say to those courts that the programs were illegal. The government said that we had no right to be in court. And the courts exceeded to that demand. The government's argument was, we couldn't prove that we had been surveilled. Therefore, we had no standing to even raise these challenges. And in a 5 to 4 decision last year, the Supreme Court accepted that rationale and dismissed the case without even considering the legality of these programs. Edward Snowden was watching that too. Now, when critics say that Edward Snowden should have gone through the system, that's the system they're talking about. Courts and a Congress that had abdicated their constitutional oversight role. Now, what's happened since Edward Snowden's act of conscience  since he brought the public into this discussion? Well, two federal judges have now considered whether the NSA's mass collection of Americans' phone data is legal. One said it's almost certainly unconstitutional, almost Orwellian. Another disagreed, but the key point is that both of these judges heard the challenge. They both agreed that we had standing to challenge the program, which was a remarkable development in itself. Finally, these courts are doing their job and more challenges are on the way. What about Congress? A newly energized Congress has held dozens of oversight hearings  public ones  And is considering sweeping intelligence reforms that we haven't seen in nearly half a century  to end bulk collection of Americans' phone records, to reform that secret FISA court so that it doesn't only hear from the government and others. Even the executive branch has undergone an extraordinary reevaluation of these programs. An NSA review panel appointed by the president  which included very, very senior former intelligence officials  the number two at the CIA  concluded that the NSA had allowed its technological capabilities to dictate its surveillance practices, rather than ensuring that its practices conform to our laws and values. None of this would have happened without Edward Snowden. For that reason alone, he was justified."

    "data": "Thank you. I was honored to be asked to be here tonight, with this distinguished group. But, to tell you the truth, since I spent 22 years as a Washington lawyer, and then some time out at the CIA in the Clinton administration, I'm actually honored to be invited into any polite company for any purpose at all. I am going to be relying on the blog, the Lawfare blog, which publishes material usually a few days after it's released to press, and much of the Snowden material has come into the public media in that way. A couple of introductory points: Once you release material that had been classified or restricted for any other contractual or any other reason, you release it to the world. Mr. Snowden pledged to protect the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic, but he didn't do that. What he did was release  steal and release  material that went to, among others, Hezbollah, alQaeda, Hamas, Pyongyang, Tehran and so on. In the real world, you can't have a principle that it is really important to release material, but you're only going to release it to nice people; you're not going to let terrorists and dictators peruse it and use it. But that's what they do, and that's what they are doing, because Mr. Snowden decided to let them do that. Also, it is important, I think, that what Mr. Snowden did must be viewed in the context of an overall approach toward dealing with these tremendous issues of privacy versus security. He looked at this question, apparently, from the point of view of one who can pick and choose those portions of an obligation that he wants to maintain. He did not stay with the proposition that he had to fulfill his obligation to the United States across the board. He ignored some duties and did not ignore others. But he did not fulfill his obligations overall. What are the consequences of this? I'm going to mention five cases that have come to light from Snowden materials and printed in the blogs, about what the consequences are of dealing with international relations in this way, and forcing your country to do it by the leaks that you have sponsored or undertaken. For example, China is the bad boy of cyber attacks. Throughout the world, Chinese cyber attacks  theft of information and material, malware, on and on  are a nuisance at best and a potential tragedy at worst to a huge range of countries and individuals. We had figured out a way, preSnowden  the United States government had  to essentially have a bit of a jiujitsu operation against the Chinese and to create a possibility whereby we could take their malware in a cyber world and send it back to them after make some adjustments and create problems for them rather than they creating problems for us. It's a clever operation. Mr. Snowden, of course, ended it by explicitly turning loose material that dealt with it precisely. We have an organization in the Middle East  the Islamic State of Iraq  a terrorist organization of the worst kind. PreSnowden, we were reading not only their emails, but their preparation, their early stage drafts of emails. Had we been reading fully the emails of alQaeda before 9/11, we might well have saved thousands of lives. But here, our ability to read ISI's emails has been now obliterated by having been made public to the terrorist group itself. In the defense department, working together with the intelligence community, it has come to be possible to utilize cell phones, and their operation, with some very clever software in such a way that you can help an individual member of the military or an individual CIA operations officer know whether he or she is being followed or not. A very clever system, one that saves people's lives. That also is no longer with us because Snowden betrayed it, and it's now known to our adversaries. In Latin America, we have come to find how to penetrate the communication networks of some of the worst organizations and groups that are selling women, principally women, into sexual slavery. We had a very good handle on how that was being done, working with other Latin American countries in dealing with it. And that trafficking, that human trafficking network and our knowledge of their capabilities is, of course, now gone, with Snowden having released that to those who are enslaving women in that part of the world."

    "data": "Thank you very much. Yes, I believe that Edward Snowden was fully justified in what he did. That does not cause me to support or make a judgment on any particular thing which has not yet been released or which has been released, exactly, but a question of whether he has served the public interest, on balance, in a way that could not have happened otherwise. I don't know the details that Ambassador, former DCI, James Woolsey, has told about. And I'm not sure how you know, actually, unless you are privy in a way that has not been announced here. I do know what has been released by the papers so far. Snowden, of course, has not released a single page by himself. He has explicitly said, over and over, that his own  he doesn't trust his own bias in terms of transparency here. He wanted a judgment to be made of public interest by journalists that he trusted, and I think with right. And that is what has come out so far. I think that he was justified to the same degree, and in the same way, that I believe I was justified in releasing 4,000 or 7,000 pages of top secret documents 40 years ago, the Pentagon Papers. I believe that I had been mistaken earlier to keep silent about what I knew to be lies by my president, Lyndon Johnson, and later the president Richard Nixon, for whom I'd also worked, about what they were doing, what was happening, what the costs were, what the prospects were in Vietnam. I was concerned at that moment not so much about the Constitution, which had clearly been violated in terms of lying us into that war, but I was concerned at the people who were dying on both sides wrongly, I thought, by our escalations and by those lies. I'm saying that Snowden, I believe, did what needed to be done, what the public needed to know. I think there was no other way  no better way and almost no other way  for that information to get out; that it was worth, as he said, taking the utmost risks to his freedom and even his life. And, of course, we've heard exaltations, actually, by Mike Rogers of the House Intelligence Committee, the Homeland Security Committee, that he should be extralegally assassinated. Others have suggested by due process of law  I give Ambassador Woolsey credit for talking about the need for due process here. But the fact is had I believed the motives that were described by the people, you know, at the beginning of the supposed opposition to Snowden, and we haven't heard that precisely from these two people yet, but  or at all  but if I'd believed that he had done this for some other country, for Russia, for China, to their benefit and  or even to major benefit to them, outweighing any benefit to the public interest  I would not be supporting him now. I believe firmly that Edward Snowden is no more a traitor than I am or that I was. And I'm not. I was called that by the president and the vice president at the time, 40 years ago  43 years ago. Many  I was called every name that has been called, virtually, to Edward Snowden or for that matter to Chelsea Manning earlier. In terms of blood on hands, as to what would be the benefit  the cost of this, none of that came out in my case, which is, I think, why I'm seen somewhat differently now, 40 years later. Nothing in Chelsea Manning's trial actually came out to justify the statement that people had died as a result of his revelations, and I think you should take with more than a grain of salt the descriptions right now that much worse will happen from Edward Snowden, revelations. The fact is that, I think, what he revealed was not just what NSA was doing, which I will make a premise  I will stipulate  was essentially with the knowledge of the president, at the orders of the president, desire of the president, and the knowledge of key figures in Congress. But, as Ben Wizner made the point, that to me reveals his greatest revelation, which is that the reforms that came in after earlier revelations of abuses by the FBI, CIA, NSA, and Army Intelligence, 40 years ago and 35 years ago, that led to the Church Committee and the current reforms, like the FISA Court and the intelligence committees, I think what Snowden has revealed is that those reforms, which were very necessary, failed. And they need to be not only redone, but better reforms are necessary, and I hope very much will result from what Snowden has revealed. As a matter of fact, I'll have mentioned already that Ambassador Woolsey has said that he thought there should be due process, there should be a trial for treason  that's something I'd argue with  which implies that he thinks that Snowden adhered to an enemy of the United States  that's the definition in the Constitution, which I know he knows. I certainly disagree with him on that, and I think there's  that's absolutely wrong. But he believes then as a result he should get the maximum penalty for that, which is to be hanged by the neck till he is dead. Now, actually one American was hanged by the neck for giving secrets to Americans. Actually, he was the first American to be charged with giving secrets to Americans. I was the second, 200 years later. His name was Nathan Hale, and it was a name that used to be known to every American school child as I know, and I've found sadly that, that's not  seems not to be the case today. And he was an American spy for George Washington during the American Revolution, hanged by the British, and the reason he was remembered during my growing up was for his words on the gallows: I regret that I have but one life to give for my country. What country was that? Not the country of his birth, that was the colony of King George III, in which he was in rebellion, and was charged with treason essentially, of which he was essentially guilty to George III, like every other signer of the Declaration of Independence, five of whom, out of 56, were hanged as a result. But they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, like Nathan Hale, to a country that did not yet exist in the world, a country of  later to be, shortly to be  of a constitution with separation of powers, independent branches with checks and balances against each other, and a country with a Bill of Rights. When Snowden said there were things worth dying for, I agree with him. That's the mood in which I gave the Pentagon Papers, and I think he was right to do what he did to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States."

    "data": "Let me jump right in. It's interesting that Mr. Ellsberg should be able to say that he's not able  or at this point  to process what's in the documents. What Ambassador Woolsey was referring to was analyses of the actual documents that have been released. If he can't say what's in the documents, that puts him in a common place with Edward Snowden himself. Notice that Mr. Ellsberg mentioned that he removed, he said, somewhere been four and seven thousand documents. And that's what was put out. Snowden has released 1.7 million documents. He couldn't conceivably have known what was in the documents at the time of purloining them and putting them out. We're talking about a massively different leak, and one that's been massively damaging to the United States. John mentioned that this is my second rodeo at Intelligence Squared. I think it's worth revisiting the first one, because it says a lot about the trajectory that we've walked on this road, between liberty and security. When I was here the last time, the question was whether we needed to have more surveillance to prevent terrorist attacks. And  it was interesting  the audience was of a mind that, you know, we absolutely did need more surveillance. They recognized we had serious enemies of the United States who wanted to mass murder Americans. But something made them uncomfortable. And when we got to talk to them afterwards, I got to find out what the something was: George Bush. Not George Bush the person, but the concept that so much power was reposed in one individual  that one person could be able to order warrantless surveillance, that one person could get to be the judge, the jury  in some instances, as commanderinchief  the executioner, on the basis of the information that was gleaned from the warrantless surveillance that was ordered, surveillance that took place without the permission of a court. And that was what the audience back then had the most trouble with, this idea that we don't have enough checks and balances. We don't have enough legislative buyin. We don't have enough judicial oversight. It's interesting, because what President Bush was trying to impose on this sort of new kind of war was old rules of war. And they were probably best explained in 1948  at least the reason for them  by Robert Jackson, who's an interesting person in American history because he's a giant in both American law and American politics. Nuremberg prosecutor, Supreme Court justice, FDR's attorney general. In a 1948 case, called Chicago and Southern Airlines v. Waterman  he explained why national security had to be an executive responsibility. And the primary reason was, in a free democracy, the framers thought the most important decisions we make are the decisions about our national security. And they need to be made by elected officials who answer to the people whose lives are at stake. And when you transfer that responsibility over to courts, you take it from the accountable public officials to public officials who are purposely insulated from politics and who you can't get rid of when they get it wrong. Well, we've spent about a half century now experimenting  and I think the experiment is still ongoing  with how far we can afford to depart from the vision of the framers. And from the 1970s forward, what we have tried to do is take rule of law protocols  which apply to the United States, and mainly the law enforcement system, in peace time  and impose them on war. And we've had a very difficult time doing it. It's been a blistering debate, at times. And nobody's happy about it. Nobody's ever happy about what the outcome is. Some people think the executive doesn't have enough control anymore. Some think the courts are too involved. Some think the courts are not involved enough. But here's the interesting thing. We did get to a place where we came together as a country  and even if everybody was not satisfied with the outcome, we did strike a balance. We established laws which took away a lot of the president's unilateral power; forced the president to go to judges in order to get surveillance authority; institutionalized rigorous congressional oversight. In fact, most of what we know about abuses at the NSA actually comes from selfreporting, whether it's selfreporting to courts or selfreporting to Congress. You may not like the laws. I don't like the laws the way that they've  the way that they’ve finally played out. The NSA program, the metadata program’s a perfect example. There's no question that it's constitutional  the Supreme Court precedent that holds that. Whether it's legal or not under the statute that Congress imposed is a closer question. It turns on what the legal definition of relevance, as applied to this national security question, is. Is it legal, is it not legal? You can make the argument that it's not, but 15 federal judges who've looked at it have upheld it. And nobody has repealed it yet for all the talk about doing that. But here's the thing: We actually set up this system with exactly the checks and balances that were at issue during the Bush days, the bad old Bush days when too much power was reposed in one person. And now where are we with Edward Snowden? We are right back to one person who's judge, jury, lawgiver, one person who decides what American secrets get kept and what gets exposed to our enemies. And that person's not the president anymore. That person is a person who had access to this information because he violated his oath. The last time I was here, the audience told me that could never, ever be justified."

    "data": "When it comes to Obamacare most of the focus is on the broken website and the problems enrolling people into the coverage, but the real failures of this plan go well beyond the internet. They’re imbedded in the structure of the law and they’ll become more acute as this scheme unfolds. Obamacare rests on some deeply flawed concepts that turn the proposals against the legislation’s own laudible goals. Simply put, it’s a plan at war with it’s own ambitions. And tonight I want to briefly address some of the paradoxes embedded in this law. First, Obamacare seeks to lower the cost of health care, but instead it creates new arrangements that will only make medical care more expensive. A big reason is provisions that deliberately force doctors to consolidate their medical practices around hospitals. Having doctors work for hospitals is often the costliest way to deliver care, and we know there's a lot of excess capacity in hospitals. We've basically built in a subsidy of that excess capacity. And we also know that there's ample evidence that when physicians become the employees of hospitals and hospitalowned systems, productivity falls. And when hospitals buy up local physicians in a community, enabling them to exercise monopoly pricing power, they raise prices. Second, the law seeks to increase competition between insurers it’s partly seen as a way to lower costs, but Obamacare will actually reduce the number of health plans in the marketplace and leave you with fewer choices. For one thing, Obamacare taps the operating margins of health plans. This basically protects the businesses of incumbent insurers at the expense of new startups and new entrants. Obamacare also uses regulation to prescribe a single uniform benefit package. The result is that consumers are left with just one option when it comes to the benefits they can choose from. Go on the website and take a look for yourself and I'm putting out some data on this next week. If you look at the health plans that insurance companies sell on the exchanges, the provider networks and the drug formularies are exactly the same. It doesn't matter if you buy a plan that's a bronze plan, a gold plan, or a platinum plan. By buying up to a costlier plan, all you're doing is lowering your copays and deductibles. In other words, you're just fronting a higher premium to buy down your outofpocket costs. There is no competition between these plans based on benefits or networks. There is no real choice in these exchanges. Third, Obamacare is aimed at reducing the number of uninsured Americans, but the vast majority of the uninsured who get coverage under this scheme will end up on Medicaid. And so what about the people who sign up for private coverage in the Obamacare exchanges? They're going to mostly be people who were previously insured in the individual or smallgroup markets and got moved into Obamacare, some of them forcibly. But don't take my word for this. Look at the numbers being put out by the administration. The White House says that 19 million people will be added to Medicaid. That's a 35 percent increase in the size of the program, but at best, five million people will get Obamacare coverage this year and it's probably going to be closer to four million. But we know at least five million people lost their policies when the mandates of this law were imposed on a private market and insurers had to drop old plans to conform. And as for the uninsured, the lower middle class folks, for people above 200 percent of the federal poverty level, family of four earning about $50,000 a year  Obamacare is still too expensive for them, even with the benefits and the subsidies. And so, a family of four earning $50,000 a year will have to pay $400 a month, even after the subsidies, to buy that coverage. That's $5,000 a month. And they're getting a plan with a $3,000 deductible. The problem is that's not a good plan for that family. And the problem is that these plans were designed in Washington to meet political aspirations rather than marketplace, to meet the demand of what consumers needed. And think about this. There were 46.3 million uninsured in 2008, when President Obama took office. This year, there were 48 million uninsured Americans. The only way the president is going to leave office with fewer uninsured Americans than when his term began is by obligating more people to Medicaid. Obamacare is really a Medicaid law. And so, it begs the question, what about Medicaid? There is now ample evidence in the clinical literature that people on Medicaid are experiencing worse health outcomes than people in other insurance schemes. And sometimes even in the uninsured. Simply put, reimbursement rates have been driven so low in the Medicaid program that folks can't get access to the benefits that they're promised on paper. I don't consider it successful if the only way we reduce the roles of the uninsured in this country is by obligating more Americans to a Medicaid program that is quite literally worsening medical outcomes. This doesn't seem moral. Yet Obamacare does almost nothing to fix that Medicaid. It just pushes more people to an already failing system. In many ways, these problems that plague Medicaid will also plague Obamacare. Obamacare makes so many costly promises on paper, but the only way to pay for these commitments is to reduce what providers are paid. And Obamacare, this is now a network that contains a very short list of providers and closed drug formularies that leave key medicines uncovered. And the Obamacare regulations don't just apply to the Obamacare plans. This is a federalization of all insurance in this country, so everyone's benefits need to conform to the single, uniform national standard. Obamacare was a response to a flawed healthcare system. There's no question about that. But it makes things worse. It reduces choice and competition in health plans. It increases costs by reducing the productivity of the practice of medicine. And finally, it only reduces the number of uninsured by obligating millions of more people to a Medicaid benefit that's quite literally harming people's health. In all of these ways, Obamacare works again its own laudable intentions. There are far better ways to address issues of the uninsured in this country and far better ways to address the issues of those who are priced out of the insurance market. For all these reasons and more, Obamacare is now beyond rescue. Thanks a lot."

    "data": "Thanks, John, and thanks for inviting me. The motion that you've heard is Obamacare is now beyond rescue. What you heard Dr. Gottlieb argue is not that it's beyond rescue, it's that he doesn't like a lot of the provisions of the law. What we're here to discuss, it seems to me, is what has been in the proposed. And the proposed was either Obamacare is now beyond rescue  meaning it's not doing what it was supposed to do   or it is not beyond rescue, and therefore it is doing what it can do. My partner, Jonathan Chait, and I will argue that not only is this law not beyond rescue, it doesn't need to be rescued because the law already has worked and is working. And to understand whether it's working, we need to understand where we were before the law was passed and what the goals of the law were. I'll cover that. And Jonathan will also discuss the achievements of Obamacare. But he'll focus on criticisms and dire predictions of which we've already heard many from the opponents of the law. Speaking of the dire predictions, we'll come back to some of the ones we heard. But there are a few, I think, that we'll have to deal with sooner rather than later. Let me first turn to the question about Obamacare and what it does. It's an insurance law, but of course it includes cost controls and quality improvements as well. I want to focus on the insurance stuff, because the question occurs, why is health insurance important? There are a lot of studies that show a lot of reasons for it. Some include showing that kids who have healthcare insurance are less likely to miss their shots. And if they don't have insurance, they're more likely to miss them. Healthy adults without insurance tend not to get mammograms and other preventive services that they need. People who have diseases such as diabetes and hypertension and they don't have insurance do poorly. They tend to be more out of control, and if they have bad outcomes like strokes, they tend to be more severe. But just as important in terms of outcomes besides health, people who have no insurance and have a serious health problem can be bankrupted by it in this system that we had until very recently. This led a group at the Institute of Medicine in a big report to say that a lack of health care insurance results in needless illness, needless suffering, and needless death. Let's turn the clock back a little bit to 2008, 2009 when this law was being debated. At that time, we had 40 to 45 million people uninsured. We were spending two and a half trillion dollars a year on health and health care and growing, and we had some of the worst statistics for health outcomes in the developed world. In addition, most of the insurance products that we saw at that time didn't have portability. If you lost your job, you often lost your insurance. You didn't have guaranteed issue, so if you had a preexisting condition and tried to get health insurance and you're not in a big group, forget about it. And there were no national standards for insurance policies. We were largely  not exclusively, but we were largely in a fee for service system with incentives really pushing towards more care, not better care, not the appropriate care, but the more you did, the more you got paid. And so it was estimated at that time that unnecessary care could've been 10, even 20 percent of the money that was being spent. And equally important were the projections  and this is just now four years ago  the projections of where we are going to be by 2018, which is just four years from now, if nothing had been done, over 60 million people uninsured at that point, health care spending going from trillion to $4.7 trillion a year, family health care premiums going up from $13,000 to average 30,000 a year, Medicare trust fund runs out of money, and no change in that fee for service culture that pays for more medicine, more health care, and not necessarily better. So in March 2010, which is now almost four years ago, we had this law signed, Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, ACA, hugely complex, admittedly, admittedly imperfect law, but not just insurance [unintelligible], quality improvement, cost reductions. What are some of the things that have happened in the first three years of this law? Young adults 26 and under now can get coverage on their parents' policies, and three million have. Preexisting conditions not allowed to prevent coverage. There's portability of insurance coverage, no lifetime caps, community rating, which means if you're in a small business, one person gets very sick or their family member does, it doesn't raise the rates for everybody. No lifetime caps on coverage, lots of stuff, and in some ways very importantly, no copays, no deductibles for preventive care that's evidence based. Also, cost related things, we're now paying hospitals for outcomes and not the services they deliver. There are penalties for hospital readmissions when someone's discharged and then readmitted to the hospital soon afterwards. Something called accountable care organizations are getting paid for performance rather than piecework, and there are many experiments and demonstrations from part of the government now called the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Importantly, cost reforms have slowed down cost dramatically. That is, the increase per year is just an average of 1.1 percent in the past three years, 2010 to 2012. So in summary, before this year, before anything that's been controversial in the news happened, there are already a lot of good things that are going on because of Obamacare. Then we come to October 2013. Everyone knows, what a disaster. Okay? People can't sign up. The computer systems don't work. The website's a mess. There's lots of confusion. Some provisions of the law were postponed. But even conceding that all this was a mess, let's look what's happened recently. Six million enrollees, two million in exchanges, 4.4 million in Medicaid  we'll come back to Medicaid  people up to 400 percent of the federal poverty levels are getting subsidies to help pay for insurance, and cost increases continue to moderate . Let me conclude now by asking you to remember where we were, where we've been, and where we are now. I want to quote from a mock interview that was in one of my favorite newspapers, a satirical newspaper called The Onion. The headline was, Nation Recalls Simpler Time When Health Care System Was Broken Beyond Repair. Here's the quote, Back then, if you couldn't afford health care insurance and got really sick, you went bankrupt, plain and simple, said a Modesto , California, mother of three. You didn't have this whole mess of lower cost options or all these subsidies you might or might not qualify for based on your income. People didn't have to deal with any of that stuff and those headaches, just went ahead and died of preventable causes."

    "data": "To hear Doug Kamerow describe it, it's amazing, and I want to sign up. But, you know, these debates often tend to sort of devolve into Who doesn't want people to die? So that's not actually what's on the table here. The issue is not Are Democrats Socialists? Are Republicans stupid and venal and terrible people? The issue is, Is this law, Obamacare, accomplishing what it set out to do? Is it making Americans better off, and can it survive in its current form? As you listen to the administration, it's impossible for Obamacare to fail because every time they don't hit some number that they've been promoting, they just change the terms and redefine its success as whatever's already happened. So, for example, just a few months ago, Kathleen Sebelius, who's the secretary of Health and Human Services, was saying that success in the exchanges was seven million people signed up by March 2014. And then they had a few problems with the exchanges, and then suddenly success wasn't having seven million people signed up, success was having a healthy demographic mix in the pool  in the insurance pools on the exchanges. Then they said that we got  needed about 40 percent of the people to be young adults, which is between the ages of 18 and 35. And then we got some data on the demographics. And so far about 20 to 25 percent of the people who've signed up are young adults, and we got many more old people than we expected, which, for a few reasons that should be fairly obvious, could make insurance cost a lot more than we were hoping, so in the most recent conference call, they said that success would be signing up as many people as possible, which is this beautifully circular reference, right, of however many people you've signed up is the number that was possible. It's the self licking ice cream cone of policy programs. But for the rest of us, I don't think it's enough for Obamacare to merely exist. It has to actually do something and do something that we want. So what did we want? What were we promised? We were promised lower costs for government and individuals, and we've heard some of that. The administration likes to claim that this has already happened. This hasn't. Health care cost growth has indeed slowed, but health care cost growth started slowing in 2004 when Barack Obama was a junior state senator from Illinois. He had not even been elected to the U.S. Senate, much less to the presidency. You see a big decline in 2005 to 2007  in 2003 to 2005, another between 2007 and 2009, but it actually leveled off in 2010 right when Obamacare comes in and cost growth is kind of bumping along if you look at the OECD figures on that. Kaiser projects  you remember we heard that the average family was going to save $2,500 a year on their premiums? That didn't happen. Kaiser is now projecting that premiums will go up. We wanted people to get healthier as a result of this law, but then we got the Oregon Medicaid Study, which is the gold standard in studies of Medicaid, and it looked at the three things you really want to look at, in preventative care, it looked at hypertension control, cholesterol control, and it showed no statistically significant results. More than half of the expansion in Obamacare comes through Medicaid. We wanted people with preexisting conditions, all of these millions of people with preexisting conditions we were told were out there to be able to buy insurance. But when they set up pools in order to cover people with preexisting conditions, they were expecting to get 400,000 people between 2010 and 2013, instead they got a quarter of that number, and they only managed to get that by lowering their requirements and doing an aggressive outreach campaign to sign more people up. And we wanted expanded health care coverage, right? But at this point, we can't even say that there are more people insured right now than there were on January 15, 2013. We  the administration says that there have been four million people added to Medicaid, but half of those people came in states that didn't even do the Medicaid expansion. So definitionally they were already eligible for Medicaid. Of the other states, some of those people were already eligible or may even be renewing their coverage. The administration can't even say that these are people who are getting new coverage. Some of them may just be going back on to Medicaid just like they were last year. We have 2.2 million people on the exchanges, but five million people had their policies cancelled. No one, I think, predicted that at this point this late in the game you wouldn't even know whether we've increased the insurance numbers and the administration refuses to certify that that is actually happening. Meanwhile, we were not supposed to hurt anyone who had insurance, right? If you liked your plan and you liked your doctor, you could keep them. We all know that that has not happened, so five million people have had their plans cancelled, and many people who are buying new plans are seeing that their doctors are not  the best hospitals and doctors in their area have been kicked off the network in order to keep the premium costs down on the exchanges. So, it was also supposed to be really popular, , right? Because we had all of this great stuff, this giant Rube Goldberg apparatus layered on top. We didn't take anything away, we only gave. And it's kind of time for a Dr. Phil moment, how is that working for you? Nothing is working the way the administration said. So you can say it does not really matter whether it is unpopular, right? The point is not to be popular, and yes, some people have gotten hurt, but you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs, right? It was never reasonable to think that everyone was going to get to keep the doctors and the plans that they wanted. Something had to change and this is a foundation for something better. But this foundation has so many cracks you cannot build a healthy structure on top of it. Just look at everything the administration has had to do in the last few months just to keep the law running. They had to delay the employer mandate and the enforcement, apparently because they couldn’t even figure out how to make this regulation work. It may never go into effect, which means we'll lose millions of people who were supposed to get coverage expanded through [unintelligible] and the cost will go up to the government. They delayed the Spanish language website, and now apparently part of it is written in Spanglish. Despite the fact that Hispanics are a major constituency for insurance expansion. They delayed the small business exchanges. They've allowed people to keep plans that were supposed to be illegal because they weren't real insurance Kathleen Sebelius told us. They've delayed deadlines over and over again. They've done all these things by asserting emergency powers by doing administrative fixes through executive fiat, and yeah fair enough, Obamacare is certainly an emergency, but all of these changes have had the effect of undermining and destabilizing the law that they think is so important. They’ve had to do these things even though they know it makes the insurance pools less actuarily sound, because they can't face the political backlash. And what happens when Republicans get into office and I assume they, too, think Obamacare is an emergency and could be fixed with some executive orders. Essentially they've made it so that Republicans can undo twothirds of this law with a stroke of the presidential pen. Obamacare is Now Beyond Rescue. The administration has destroyed their own law in order to save it. Thank you."

    "data": "Has anybody here ever renovated a house? I've done it twice. It was hell. Every day I went through brought fresh misery and fresh reason to think why am I doing this, but in the end it worked, and the reason it worked is because we know how to renovate houses, right? So when you hear about the problems that our opponents are describing in the law, they had to delay this, they had to fix this, the Spanish language website didn't work as well as they wanted the first day. You have to ask, are these things that are going to fundamentally destroy the law or are they the kind of problems you have in a renovation? They said, oh, we didn't quite get the counters we want. Oh, this went a little bit over cost. Well, then you have to ask  to answer that question you have to ask what kind of endeavor is Obamacare? Is the Obama administration trying to build a moon base? Is the Obama administration trying to build a thriving liberal democracy in a hostile Muslim country? No. What they're trying to do is build a national health insurance plan. Can you build a national health insurance plan? Well, every advanced economy in the world, except the United States, has built a national health insurance plan. All of those countries insure all their citizens and all of them pay considerably less than we pay here in the United States. So you’re a priori assumption has to be yeah, this is something you can basically do that the problems you have are not signs that everything is about to collapse onto itself, but the problems you have any time you go through any major project. So, what our opponents have been trying to do for months, and months, and months, actually is paint this picture where every time the contractor comes to you and says, Oh, it turns out they don't have this color, oh, it turns out the plumber is unavailable on this day, it means the whole thing is going to collapse on its own. But actually, nothing like that is happening at all. And there is no evidence that anything like this is happening. The main argument that the opponents have been making the entire time is that there is going to be a death spiral. That's the only plausible mechanism that they have, that the law will fail. A death spiral is a term that I expected them to talk about, because that's what they've been talking about for months. It's something they've barely invoked at all. And I think the reason is it's become clear, in recent days, that there's no chance of a death spiral in the Obamacare law. A death spiral is when you have too many old, sick people who drive up the cost, making the premiums more expensive, leading the healthy people to flee, driving up costs more. That is theoretically possible, but is not something that can possibly happen in this law. In fact, if you want to say, Is the law succeeding? you don't have to ask the administration. You could ask the insurers, right? Because the insurers have recently been saying they're very happy with the mix of people  the mix of people you have in the exchanges is sound. It's sustainable. They don't need  they don't need it to change. They've got a mix of people that's healthy enough to keep the exchanges going forward. What's more, even if you had more old people going into the exchanges than they expect, you had  the Kaiser Health Foundation ran the numbers and said, What's the worstcase scenario? We don't get any increase in young people at all. And they said it would be about a 2.4 percent increase in premiums 2.4 percent increase in health insurance premiums. If any of you have ever had health insurance and you get a 2.4 percent increase over your bill last year, you'd say, Thank God it's only a 2.4 percent increase, right? That's a rounding error. No one notices 2.4 percent. That couldn't possibly set off a death spiral. So there's really no plausible mechanism that the law could fail. So I think what they're giving you  instead of what used to be the plausible mechanism for which the  this can fail, they're giving you a mix of wishes and hopes and completely debunked facts. They said, Cost growth leveled after 2010. No. Cost growth in 2012 was lower than at any year in 50 years. And in fact  this is important because when the law was passed, cost growth was the main thing they talked about. Obamacare was supposed to control costs. And they said, No, no, it's going to make costs explode with all this bureaucracy regulation. They're going to go out of control. What happened is that cost growth came in way lower than the most optimistic estimates believed it would be before the law was signed. And so now, they're reduced  instead of saying, This disaster of cost growth is going to happen, they're going to say, This incredible miracle of low cost growth is simply a coincidence. So, all they're saying is essentially that this wonderful thing that's happened has nothing to do with the gigantic change in healthcare or that happened just before costs started going to the lowest level in 50 years. And you can't prove that it's not a coincidence. But you have to  see, this is indicative of the mentality we're dealing with, where it simply moves from one possible disastrous scenario to another possible disastrous scenario. So you have to wonder, Why are they simple moving from one disaster scenario to another disaster scenario? Actually, I wanted to debunk a couple points they made, because a lot of this is just  we've heard from the other side  are not true. I can't give you links and charts to debunk them, but let me say that it's not the case that 5 million policies have been canceled. That's a number that was floating about that you can't verify. It's almost certainly not true. Many journalists have tried to figure out exactly how many policies have been canceled. And they don't have good enough records to know, but they know it's not 5 million. And they suspect  the administration suspects it's closer to onetenth of that figure. They can't actually prove that either, but for various reasons, you don't have a good enough count. This  that's almost certainly nowhere close to 5 million. And that's a big number that's  they're citing because they're saying, that  those are the losers. But it's really nowhere close to that. Yet they say  Megan said we can't  we can't say for sure how many  how  that there are more insured now than there were before. We can't say for sure, because again, this number can't exactly be counted. We don't know that 400,000  it was 500,000. But we know it's not anywhere close to 5 million. And it's a mortal certainty that far more people have health insurance now than would have had in absence of the law. So why are we having this kind of lurch, from one argument, abandoning these arguments when they disappear, and simply coming up with new ones? The truth is, they disagree with the goals of the law. And I think you could hear that in their remarks. They say, There's less choice. And it's true. The government says insurers have to provide certain benefits right. They have to provide pregnancy coverage. That's  and maternity care. Those are the most controversial things that are mostly cited, because they want people who are male or old to not have to pay for those things. And they want people who are young and female and might have to bear children to pay those costs themselves, because that's an ideological difference between the two sides. And that's fine for them to have an ideological difference between the two sides. But we're not here to debate whether this law is a good idea. We're here to debate whether the law is actually working, and the truth is the only reason they're desperately trying to claim the law is not working is because they oppose national health insurance."

    "data": "Thank you. Gene will be talking about the ethical and environmental issues. I'm going to talk about health. In 2009, the Archives of Internal Medicine published a massive research study. The NIHAARP study had a half a million participants. They were followed for 10 years. Some of them didn't eat meat or didn't eat very much. Some ate quite a lot of meat. And what they showed was that among those eating the most meat, the risk of dying of cancer was increased by fully 20 percent and heart disease deaths were increased by 27 percent among men and 50 percent among women. And in 2012, the Archives of Internal Medicine published another study. One hundred and twenty thousand people. This was coordinated all at Harvard University. And it showed exactly the same thing: if you ate a lot of meat, your risk of dying of heart disease was much higher; your risk of dying of cancer was higher. And studies have clearly shown that people who don't eat meat cut their cancer risk by anywhere between 12 and 40 percent. Well, why would meat be linked to cancer? Hold that thought for a second. I grew up in Fargo, North Dakota, and I come from a long line of cattle ranchers. My dad raised cattle, my grandpa raised cattle, as far back as I can trace. Now, my dad did not like the cattle business. He objected to it a great deal. He went to medical school. He spent his life treating diabetes in Fargo, North Dakota. But we still ate like we were in the cattle business. Every day it was roast beef, baked potatoes, and corn, except for special occasions when it was roast beef, baked potatoes, and peas. And my grandfather had a heart attack, and he then became quite severely demented, and he died. And we took that as normal because he was old. He was 65. My other three grandparents lived longer, but each one of them succumbed to severe dementia year after year after year, and they all finally died. And none of us thought that maybe food had something to do with this. Now, I got my first wakeup call at Fairview Hospital in Minneapolis, where I was the autopsy assistant. One day a man died in a hospital of a massive heart attack, probably from eating hospital food, but that's another story. And the pathologist came in the room, and he knew that I was headed for medical school. So he removed a section of ribs, and he sliced open one of the coronary arteries, and he said, Look inside. And it looked like chewing gum in this coronary artery, but when I felt it, it was hard like a rock. And he said, That's atherosclerosis. That's your morning sausage, Neal. That's your bacon, Neal. That's your roast beef in there. And he said, We see the beginnings of this in three quarters of people by age 23, which happened to be the age I was at the time. And he wrote up all his findings. He left the room. And I had to clean up. I took the ribs. I put them back in the chest. I tried to make them fit with the other ribs. And I sewed up the skin, cleaned up, and I went up to the cafeteria, where they were serving ribs for lunch. Now, fast forwarding a little bit, a little  a few years later Dr. Dean Ornish brought in to a research study people who had atherosclerosis, they had narrowed arteries, he took the meat out of their diets, and something happened that had never been shown before. The arteries actually started opening up again, so much that you could see a measurable difference in 82 percent of patients in the first year with no surgery and no medications. Grassfed beef does not do that, including the beef my family raised. It just doesn't work. Eating chicken and eating fish just can't do that. And so my research team tried this same kind of diet for people who wanted to lose weight, and NIH funded us to try this kind of diet for people who had diabetes. And it works better than any other diet. Why? Because when you get meat out of the diet, meat has fat in it and every gram of fat has nine calories. That's its job. You get it out of the diet, and you get rid of a lot of calories. Meat has zero fiber, none. Fiber fills you up without calories, and if the foods you have don’t have it, you’re going to eat too much, and you’re going to gain weight. Why diabetes? Because getting the meat out of the diet helps fat to drain out of the muscle cells, allowing insulin to start working on its own. And we saw something I never saw in medical school, which is diabetes improving, sometimes even disappearing for all intents and purposes. And when we look at broad population studies, the meateaters are always the heaviest group, and the people who eat no meat are always the thinnest. Diabetes is the same way. It’s about 8 percent of adult meateaters, and among vegetarians, 3 percent. High blood pressure, exactly the same. You just don’t see it very much in people following vegetarian diets. But why more cancer? Well, when we heat up meat, something happens that doesn’t happen with plant foods, and that’s that carcinogens called heterocyclic amines form in the meat, especially chicken, but any kind of skeletal muscle, which is what meat is. But that’s not the only carcinogen. We also see polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, there’s heme iron, there are a lot of things. Plus meat doesn’t have fiber that protects you. It doesn’t have any vitamin C. It’s low in important antioxidants. So it’s like tobacco. We know for sure tobacco causes lung cancer, but we’re not 100 percent sure which part of the tobacco smoke is responsible. We know clearly that meat causes cancer in other parts of your body. The stomach, the intestinal tract  but we’re not sure. Is it the HCAs? The PAHs? We’re not quite sure yet. I asked Dr. Richard Leakey, the famous paleoanthropologist, how did we get into meat eating? And he said humans are naturally primates. We’re great apes. We are not carnivores, and we ate things we could pick with our hands, until the Stone Age gave us stone tools, and meateating began, he believes, as scavenging. Lying with leafs and bones, we would scrape it up with these stone tools that we now had. Problem: we have preStone Age bodies that get cancer and get heart disease when you eat meat. Of course, if your life expectancy is 35 or 40, it doesn’t matter, but if you live to a midage and beyond, then these things matter a lot. And what matters now is Alzheimer’s disease. We have now learned that a diet high in saturated fat  that’s the bad fat in meat  is linked to Alzheimer’s disease in studies in Chicago, in New York, in Finland. And meateaters actually have very poor nutrition. Yes, they get protein, but they don’t get many vitamins, they don’t get any complex carbohydrates, they’re missing fiber. A vegetarian diet gives you all the protein you’re going to need, plus many more vitamins, many more minerals. So Bill Clinton did. Al Gore did it. Bob Barker did it. Serena Williams did it. Since 2004 meateating has dropped by 9 percent. That’s where we’re going. That’s the future. Thank you very much."

    "data": "First, thank you to everyone involved tonight for providing us with an opportunity to debate this issue in such an excellent forum. And John, every time that I buy meat, I always think about the conditions the cow was raised in. Tonight my partner Joel Salatin and I will urge you to vote against the motion, Don’t Eat Anything with a Face. I’d like to begin by telling you a personal story. When I was 18, I became a vegetarian, because I believed that this would be the most healthful, ethical, and ecologically conscious dietary choice I could make. Six months later I became a vegan, meaning I excluded all animal products from my diet. After all, I had to follow the inevitable conclusion of my own logic. All animals die regardless of whether we kill them, and what I opposed most strongly was the cruelty and abuse seen in the industrial factory farm, which is often worse for laying hens and dairy cows than it is for animals raised for meat. I’m sure that my opponent, Gene, will explain some of this abuse to you later tonight. A year and a half down the road, it became clearer and clearer that my dietary journey through vegetarianism and veganism was failing to bring me into any promised land of vibrant health. Many preexisting health problems, that had mostly been a nuisance to me in the past, devolved into burdens that crippled my daytoday function. My digestion worsened, my energy tanked, and my irritability skyrocketed. Intense exercise began giving my anxiety and heart palpitations. In a single dental examination, I found out that I had over a dozen cavities and needed two root canals. Worst of all, my anxiety disorders aggravated to the point that I had several panic attacks per week and was often afraid to eat my own food or even begin driving my own car. But then I encountered the work of Weston Price, which really changed my life. Weston Price was the first research director for what became the American Dental Association and was a pioneer in nutritional and medical anthropology. He documented  all over the globe, in different climates, in different altitudes and latitudes, in groups with radically different cultural and genetic backgrounds  the consistent effects of the nutritional transition from traditional diets to what he called the displacing foods of modern commerce: white flower, white sugar, white rice, vegetable oils, and canned goods. In every case, the transition was one from radiant and vibrant health to not only tooth decay and dental deformities, but often to tuberculosis, cancer, ulcers, appendicitis, cystitis, gallbladder disease, physical degeneration of all kinds. All of the groups that successfully maintained vibrant health on their traditional diets placed special emphasis on the need for animal products rich in fatsoluble vitamins. Some groups emphasized dairy products, others emphasized organ meats and egg yolks, others the animal life of the sea, and yet others small animals and insects. Price went on to provide laboratory and clinical evidence that the emphasis on these foods was in fact a critical reason for the success of these traditional diets. After reading Price's work, I began emphasizing highquality, nutrientdense animal foods in my own diet, and within months my anxiety disorders completely disappeared, and my tooth decay came to a crashing halt. I truly felt like a new person. Indeed, my mental and physical health had undergone a revolution. My experience raises two questions: First, am I alone in it? And second, what happened to me and why? The scientific literature shows that I'm not alone. Seven out of eight relevant studies found that compared to omnivores, vegetarians have a greater risk of mental disorders, including eating disorders, depression, poor selfesteem, anxiety, and contemplated or attempted suicide. A study published in 2010 found that compared to omnivores, vegans had eight times more lesions involving poor mineralization of the teeth. Why might this be? Well, simply put, many nutrients are much easier to get from animal products than from plant products. Perhaps the most underappreciated of these is cholesterol. Many people are aware that high cholesterol is associated with heart disease. But few people are aware that low cholesterol is associated with mental disorders, violent and selfinjurious behavior, hemorrhagic stroke, cancer, and increased total mortality. Dr. Barnard himself has published scientific papers showing that, although his diet leads to increased intakes of many nutrients, primarily from fruits and vegetables, it also leads to decreased intakes of vitamin B12, vitamin D, and selenium, and fails to guarantee an adequate intake of zinc. Dr. Barnard recommends supplementing with vitamin B12 and vitamin D and emphasizing vegan foods rich in zinc, but the foods richest in zinc aren't vegan at all. They're oysters, beef, and cheese. It is unlikely that supplementing our way out of these nutrient deficiencies, moreover, will be a complete success, because all of these nutrients have very complex interactions with the other components present in the foods in which we find them. Vitamin B12, for example, synergizes with key amino acids found most abundantly in meat, bones, and skin. Is it possible to design an adequate diet that does not include the meat of animals with faces? I actually think that it is. It would include egg yolks, dairy products and shellfish. Shellfish are neither vegan nor vegetarian, after all; they're animals. But many people might argue, perhaps correctly, that they don't have faces. Such a diet, however, would not be adequate for everyone. Let me provide, by way of example for now, just one reason why: Vitamin A. Vitamin A is found most abundantly in liver and cod liver oil or the liver oils of other fishes, while more moderate amounts are found in egg yolks and butter fat. Red, orange, yellow and green vegetables provide carotenoids such as beta carotene which we can convert into vitamin A. However, the efficiency of this conversion is relatively poor and highly variable. Half of people with European ancestry have a genetic variant that cuts their ability to make the conversion in half, and a third, other variant that cuts it fourfold. These people are extremely unlikely to get enough vitamin A from plant foods alone and would do best if they included liver or cod liver oil in their diet which are derived from animals with faces. In order to construct an optimal dietary approach that is robust to error and adaptable to individual needs, we need to abandon the false dichotomy between healthy plant foods and supposedly unhealthy animal foods, and instead embrace the health value of highquality, nutrientdense foods of all types. Fortunately, animal foods are highest in quality and richest in nutrients when the animals are raised in an ethical and ecologically conscious manner, with highquality soil, out on pasture in the fresh air and sunshine. My partner Joel Salatin will explain more about how this is done and will conclude our opening argument for why you should vote against this motion."

    "data": "Thank you very much, and thank you for this opportunity. It's wonderful to be discussing this issue. Most people don't think enough about our food choices and about the animals who suffer terribly for the meat, milk and eggs that is produced in this country. I grew up eating animals without really thinking about it. My parents ate animals, my brothers and sisters ate animals. Everybody around me was doing it, so I just adopted the habit, without really thinking about it. But as I started learning about the fact of how these animals were treated and about the fact that I could live well without eating animals, I made the choice to become a vegan. I did that back in 1985. It's one of the best choices I've ever made. And the fact that we can live well without eating other animals, without causing harm, I think is the key question here, the key point. If we can live well without causing harm, why wouldn't we do it? And the main reason is that we just sort of grow up doing it, without thinking about it. So, the question is, how can we live well? How do we want to feel when we treat other animals the way we treat them? And on these factory farms, they're treated horribly. I visited farms across the country. I've seen animals put in these small cages where they can't move. You walk into these farms, and you're hit with this horrible stench. They're living in their feces. They're screaming to get out of their cages, and they live that way their whole lives, and then they're killed young so that we can eat them. And, you know, when people see this, they don't like it. And oftentimes people say, Don't tell me. I don't want to know, when the issue of factory farming comes up, because it is so upsetting and because we are compassionate, and because we are hardwired to have empathy. When we look at other animals, and we see them suffer, when we look at other people, and we see them suffer, we feel something. That is one of the best parts of our humanity, this empathy, this ability to feel something when we look into somebody else's face. When the executioners at the Salem witch hunts were charged with killing witches, they were told, Don't look into their face, because if you do, they'll cast a spell on you, and you won't be able to kill them. Basically, when you look into their face, there's empathy, there's a connection, there's an understanding that there's a living creature there. And when you abuse another animal or another person for that matter, there's this tendency to try to denigrate them and to say, well, they don't really have feelings. They don't really deserve any better. And that's unfortunately what has happened to farm animals. There are these misconceptions and incorrect ideas about animals on farms not being smart. For instance, people think turkeys are so dumb they'll go outside and they'll drown in the rain. This is one of these myths that people say, probably to feel better about mistreating animals. But we've raised turkeys at Farm Sanctuary for many years. They go outside. They've never gone out and drowned in the rain. They enjoy, you know, going indoors and outdoors. And when the animals come to us, they're often afraid because they've only known cruelty. But when they start recognizing they're in a safe place, and they start being treated with kindness, they respond. And it's a beautiful thing to see. We had a turkey at our farm in California we used to call Lydia the Hugging Turkey, because you'd go out into the barnyard and kneel down, and she would come up to you, and she would crane her neck around your neck like she was giving you a hug. So these animal show companionship and friendship. And I'm not the only one that has seen this. People who visit Farm Sanctuary and work there have seen this. Jane Goodall, also, is now speaking out about the fact that these animals have feelings and much more intellectual and emotional depth than we ever knew before. She said, Farm animals feel pleasure and sadness, excitement and resentment, depression, fear and pain. They are far more aware and intelligent than we ever imagined. They are individuals in their own right. Now, on factory farms, these animals are treated horribly. I think there is widespread support among this panel even among those who think that it's okay to eat animals, that factory farming is an abomination, that it should not occur. It is outside the bounds of acceptable conduct. The real challenge is discussing, what about animals who are not treated so badly? Should we eat them? And I would suggest, no, we should not. We do not need to. We do not need to cause them harm. And whenever animals are seen as consumable products, there is a tendency to treat them not very well. I've been to factory farms, I have been to small farms, and even on these farms that are purported to be humane, there are significant problems. Whenever the animals are seen as consumables, the relationship is one of exploitation, and that is a huge problem that we need to face, and something we don't need to do. In addition, animal production is very wasteful. The United Nations came out with a report a couple years ago talking about how animal agriculture is one of the top contributors to the most serious environmental problems we're facing on the planet, including climate change. And these animals are routinely fed antibiotics as well, so we have these antibioticresistant pathogens that are now developing on these farms. And so these are other problems associated with this attitude of looking at animals just as commodities. So, eating animals is bad for the animals. It is bad for the environment. It is bad for us. It is not necessary. We can live and be healthy on eating plants alone. I urge you to vote yes on the motion that we should not eat anything with a face. So thank you very much."

    "data": "We're going to have an interesting evening since potatoes have eyes. Corn has ears. Cabbages have heads. And, goodness, what are we going to do about those navel oranges? Eating things with faces is great, so I'm happy with our negative position. Chris and I have some overarching positions. Number one: affirmative studies, affirmative studies impugning animal farming or omnivorous nutrition must be based on pasturebased data, not chemical, pharmaceutical, concentrated animal feeding operations, like CAFOs. On our farm, the nutrient difference in folate  just pick one nutrient  between a USDAblessed  we call it the U.S. duh  The USDAblessed egg at 47 micrograms and a Polyfacepastured egg at 1,200 micrograms are incomparable. Chris and I categorically reject any and all CAFOs, chemical fertilization, aquifer irrigation, and genetic modification, as being necessary or meritorious in food production. Factory food has no merit in this debate, and none of the studies will hold water if they use factory food, and you'll find that they all do. Number two: Plants are sentient beings. They attack, communicate, respond, and build communities. Their language is chemical. Plants have faces, even though we might not recognize them. The affirmative promotes a segregated view toward life. Chris and I promote an integrated view. Number three: The motion before you does not allow for climate, cultural, economic, or hunger contingencies. An essential thing: the affirmative has not asked for any contingencies. If the affirmative wanted some contingencies, they should have worded the resolution or not agreed to their position. Chris and I will hold them to the motion's clarity. Number four: Domestic livestock are owned by 60 percent of the world's poor, primarily because they represent portable wealth to the unlanded poor and nutrition density protected from spoilage and vermin. The affirmative position is a direct attack on the world's poor. Number five: Not a single affirmative study assumes modern, pasturebased models, using hightech electric fencing, portable shade cloth shelters, permaculture, hydration techniques, or cottagebased, localized processing infrastructure. This oversight dooms every affirmative conclusion to obsolescence. Number six: Life requires death. The fact that all of us can come to this luxurious room, comfortable and wellfed, and entertain ourselves by debating whether we should viscerally and actively participate in our role on an ecological continuum is bizarre. Native Americans ate 10 pounds of buffalo a day, when they could get it. And plenty of starving children in the world would be grateful for a morsel of anything, whether it wiggles or not. Number seven: Everything is eaten and being  is eating and being eaten. If you don't believe that, go lie naked in your flowerbed for three days, and see what gets eaten. Number eight: Humans are the ultimate caretaker species, and the notion that my dog is my uncle is my cat is my child does not indicate an evolutionary newfound state of heightened spiritual cosmic awareness, but rather a profound devolution into ignorance and disconnection to our ecological umbilical. Number nine: Killing and eating are interchangeable. If it is wrong to eat, then it is wrong to kill. Killing without eating is an insult to life and resource. Number ten: Environmental integrity demands certain patterns whether we like them or not. Chris and I believe these patterns supersede Mickey Mouse, Bambi, and Templeton, the rat. When my parents purchased 550 acres in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley in 1961, it was a cheap and great. Gullies, many measuring maybe 12 feet deep, incised the fields  deep scars, testifying to the death from grain production. Organic matter averaged one percent. Large areas that had lost three to five feet of top soil were barren rock. At the time, the farm would only support 20 cows. Now, a mere 52 years later, organic matter averages 8 percent, the gullies are healing, the barren rock faces are covered with a foot of new top soil, and the farm supports 150 cows. Out of ashes came a phoenix. How? By mimicking the foundational principle of ecological health. Animals (primarily herbivores), perennials, and predation. In case you missed this in biology class, here’s how it works: Sunlight converts to biomass through photosynthesis. The biomass grows slowly at first, then rapidly, then goes into senescence. The herbivore prunes the senescence biomass back to restart the rapid growth cycle. Predation  both carnivorous and otherwise, like weather or fire  creates movement patterns, even intensifying herbivores into mobs. All fertile soils have been built with perennials, herbivores, and predators, not tillage and annuals, like wheat and corn. By practicing this mob stocking herbivorous solar conversion lignified carbon sequestration fertilization, our farm is growing soil, growing organic matter, healing the water cycle, and pulling greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. Every single nook and cranny on the planet is full of animals. Why? Because they convert biomass into soil. From kitchen scraps fed to the homestead chickens to caribou converting lichens to manure, animals create ecological integrity. Humans can’t eat most biomass. The few types we can, like vegetables, require extremely fertile soil. Not one single organic vegetable or produce regimen exists that doesn’t rely on animal or fish manures for fertility. The principle of life requiring death or sacrifice is a most profound spiritual and ecological truth. How we treat the plant and animal in life impart sacredness to the sacrifice. The reason herbivores and seafood form the basis of all diets in antiquity is because these were the only nutrientrich options that didn’t require tillage and storage. Until mechanization and cheap energy, tillage was extremely laborious. Another critical ecological function for animals was that they were the only way nature had of moving around fertility. Gravity pulls biomass downhill. The only way to defy gravity and pull it back uphill is to either walk it up or fly it up. What makes it do that? Predation. The most efficacious way to remediate environmental degradation while producing the nutrition required by our human population is to embrace animal husbandry in a biomimicry paradigm: perennial, animal, predator. Alan Savory’s eloquent TED talk explains proper animal management is the best hope for stopping climate change and desertification. So vote for ecological integrity and nutritional superiority that we should eat both plants and animals. In case you forgot, it’s the negative position in this debate."

    "data": "Thank you very much, John. Thank you all for coming. These issues we're debating tonight are difficult and very complex. They engage some of the most fundamental issues in American public life: Liberty, security, technology, democracy. And there really are no simple answers to this. We'll do our best to distill it, but let me just say, anyone who's worked in these issues in a practical way knows how hard they are and that they do need to be very carefully weighed and not handled impulsively or ideologically. I'm going to make three points in this opening statement. The programs that we're going to talk about tonight really do matter for security. And for me, having been deputy commissioner of counterterrorism at the NYPD and then three different jobs in the White House before, during and after 9/11, I can really tell you this on a first hand basis. And we may get into some of the details of how this works, how these sorts of systems lead to the original lead that then leads to the unraveling of a plot and the saving of lives. It is not abstract. It is real no kidding lives at stake sort of business. I don't want to hyperventilate about it, but I've lived through enough of them to be able to recount some of the direct experiences. And if that comes up in a Q&A, we'll have to go through them in greater detail. But they really do matter. Turns out a terrorist plot is not that difficult to stop if you know about it, and finding out about it in the first place is by far the hardest step in the process. In the overwhelming number of incidents that we've had since 9/11, that original lead, what's called the predication for further investigative steps, has come from electronic surveillance of one form or another, so these programs really do matter. Second, and what I'm about to say I think is going to unite both sides of this debate. Stewart and I have worked on these issues for a while. We are for lawful surveillance, lawful forms of electronic surveillance, things which clearly backed up by the Constitution, by statute, and by court interpretation are permissible, so don't for a second think that Stewart and I are arguing for anything that is illegal. And since the other side I think is very likely not to argue in favor of illegal surveillance either, I think this is something that brings us together. We are for lawful forms of surveillance. And there is an extensive body of law that governs when, how, where these systems can be deployed. And this is not a legal seminar, but I can tell you that, that system has evolved in such a way, over the last 35 years, that it is really nothing short of an enormous success for the American privacy and civil liberties community. It's hard to believe, but it's a fact that 35 years ago there was no statutory constraint and no jurisprudential constraint on the ability of the president of the United States to conduct electronic surveillance inside the United States for foreign intelligence purposes. It was unfettered. Now it's fettered quite significantly, first with the creation of a FISA court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, with  and an act of 1978, and then adjusted in important ways with the FISA Modernization Acts of the last five years. And so this is something you really have to understand, if you take this in kind of broader historical context, an incredible amount of progress has been made, and these sorts of programs have been brought under the constraint of law where they were not previously. Previously  if these laws had never been passed, it was solely the powers of the president under the Constitution, Article 2 that permitted him to do this. And those days are over. Now there is a law which governs it, and many laws, in fact, and the court is involved in overseeing things which previously were exclusively within the domain of the president. There are now checks and balances on his power to do that, and that is extraordinary progress. And the third thing I want to say is how unusual this area is in Washington. As I said, there's partisan gridlock in here. Name me another issue in public life, health care or taxation or entitlement reform or what to do in the Middle East, where you have the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judiciary all unanimous about the contours and direction of a specific program. It's remarkable that this happened, not just the three branches of government but in the case of the executive branch a set of policies and programs which have survived partisan transition. So these programs which we have today emerged in the latter half of the Bush administration and have survived essentially unchanged into the Obama administration, two leaders who could not be more different. And they are unchanged. And so this is where the other side of this debate really have a pretty tough argument because you have broad bipartisan majorities in both chambers of Congress, the two presidents of different parties, different characters, one, the current one, quite liberal and quite educated in Constitutional law  he taught it, University of Chicago  and the judiciary all backing up and saying it's fine. So what the other side has to do, and it's a tough burden I think, is say, They've all got it wrong, we've got it right, we know better. And I think frankly that's a pretty high burden for them. Thank you very much."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you, John, and just to be clear, the question isn’t whether there are threats; there have always been threats and I would be the last person in the world to tell you that there aren’t threats right here in our own community that can harm us. And it’s not whether the government should have tools to address those threats  of course it should. It’s whether the tools the government is using today are necessary, legal, or effective. I oppose the motion Spy on Me, I’d Rather be Safe because I’m not a terrorist or a violent criminal, and spying on me isn’t going to keep anybody safe. And unless you’re a terrorist or a criminal you should also vote no, whether you care about your privacy or not because spying on you is only going to waste security resources and fill important intelligence databases with irrelevant information. Spying on you and spying on me makes us less free and less safe. We know that spying on us didn’t protect us from the Christmas Day underwear bomber, from the Times Square bomber, from Najibullah Zazi’s crew who got an explosive into New York City, but ultimately flushed it down the toilet rather than detonating it. These terrorists all traveled to foreign terrorist training camps. Then they came to the United States and attempted to bomb us. Luck is what protected us in these cases, not mass surveillance. Spying also didn’t protect us from the Boston Marathon bombers or shootings at Fort Hood or at an army recruiting center in Arkansas. These terrorists were investigated by the FBI before they went on their rampages and yet they weren’t stopped. While the government was spying on us, violence from far right extremists killed 300 people in the United States since 2001. And this is just a tiny fraction of the 14,000 murders that happen in the United States every year. A third of those  more than a third of those  go unsolved. Solving 4,000 murders a year? That would keep us safer. In a 16year FBI career, I can honestly say I never found a criminal or a terrorist by rummaging through the personal information of innocent people. Traditional law enforcement standards of reasonable suspicion and probable cause don’t just exist to protect our rights. These standards actually helped me as an investigator, because they forced me to focus on the right people for the right reasons, to follow evidence rather than flawed hunches or profiles. In my undercover work against neoNazis and antigovernment militias, there were a lot of people saying things I didn’t like, but I knew I had to have a reasonable basis to assume somebody was engaging in violent activity or illegal activity. Otherwise, if I couldn’t find that I could just turn my attention to somebody else, because again there are real threats, and this standard helped me focus my investigations properly so those cases successfully prevented terrorist attacks, ended in successful prosecution, and didn’t violate anyone’s rights. Today our government’s spying on all of us in a lot of different ways. It collects all of our telephone records on an ongoing daily basis. It photocopies every piece of domestic mail, it intercepts Americans’ international communications and financial transactions, it collects millions of images from license plates readers and surveillance cameras. The FBI even collects census information so it can map American communities by race and ethnicity. The problem with these programs  the problem is that these programs collect so much information that the signal gets lost in the noise. So it’s not a surprise that the NSA can point to only one terrorismrelated prosecution that might not have happened absent gobbling up all of our telephone numbers, and that was a material support for terrorism case that involved an $8,000 transmittal to Somalia. Think of the billions of dollars these programs cost and how that could have been spent on so many different things, including things that improve security. If a 2011 triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts had been solved the Boston Marathon bombing might never have happened. Instead of making us safe, these mass surveillance programs cast undeserved suspicion on innocent people, simply because they’re linked somehow to a suspect  not a terrorist, but suspect, often by two or three degrees of separation, like that old Kevin Bacon game. This process creates a flood of false positives that then have to be run to ground. These are what the FBI used to call the Pizza Hut leads because they often ended up at the pizza delivery guy. The difficulty resolving this false suspicion leads to bloated watch lists, the watch list, over a million names on it now, but often not the right names, like the Underwear Bombers. The flood of data coming into the intelligence community is so overwhelming the agents that it's harming our security. The National Counterterrorism Center says it receives 5,000 pieces of information and puts 350 people on the watch list every day. The official review of the FBI's investigation of Major Nadal Hassan prior to the Fort Hood shooting blamed what is called the relentless workload on the agent, which was caused by what it said was a data explosion within the FBI. The FBI assessment of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was one of 1,000 assessments the Boston JTTF did that year. A study of intelligence community analysts published earlier this year included some interesting quotes. One analyst said, There's just so much information. How do I know which of 3,000 cables to pay attention to? It's an unrealistic expectation."

    "data": "Thanks, John. Mike German has put the problem, I think, as directly as it could be. When, if ever, is it appropriate for the government to gather data on large populations, everybody in order to make us more safe? So that's the question. You can call it spying on everybody, if you like, and he does. But it's not as unusual or as ineffective, and certainly not illegal as he suggests. And I'll take his challenge of saying, When has spying on everybody  when has gathering all of the data on everybody, innocent or not, helped us stop terrorist attacks? and let's take the Zazi case, the Times Square bombing case, the Underwear Bomber. When I was at DHS, one of the things we fought very hard to do was something that I think Mike German would call spying on everyone. We said we want the airlines to give us the travel reservation information and the passport information on everybody who's flying into the United States; everybody, not just the suspects. We need to know who's coming here. We use that data to compare the names and the information that was on there to the databases in which we had information about people we were worried about, or patterns that we were worried about. And then when those people arrived, a few of them, half of a percent, would end up spending about 45 minutes talking to a customs agent about why they were coming to the United States, who would try to determine whether this person was a threat. That was a routine practice. And most of us just, you know, it's welcome home, and you move on. But a few people, they couldn't stop everybody, but they could stop a few people. They used this data to decide who was worth worrying about. Now, let's take the Underwear Bomber. The people who did airport security had no information about him. And not surprisingly, didn't check in very carefully, and he got right past them. It turned out that when he was due to land, he had already been flagged by the customs folks who had access to that data as somebody that they, through checking back in databases, were able to identify as somebody that they were worried about. So he would have been caught if we'd had the information earlier, and he would have been caught when he landed. That's, indeed, probably why alQaeda wanted to blow up the plane before he had to get past the customs officials. The same thing is true for the Times Square Bomber, where after the bombing, the FBI got a phone number. They asked our guys, do you have that phone number? Did anybody with that phone number come into the United States? Turned out that he'd given that same phone number to the airline for his reservation data. The department was able to identify him, provide the data, start a man hunt. And then he got on the plane and was about to leave the country. The only reason we caught him is because we had data on everybody who was getting on that plane, and we were able to run the information in the background and determine, this is the guy we're looking for. He's on the plane. That plane had already closed its doors when the customs officials went on to pull him off. He would have gotten away, but for the data which Mike German calls, Spying on everybody. I would call it gathering data that is already in the hands of third parties, given it to the airlines, they're going to use it to decide whether you get chicken or tornadoes, and whether you get that 3 inches of extra leg room. You know, I'm happy to have that information also used to make sure I actually arrive at my destination. And it seems to me that the intrusion  you can call a lot of scary things, but the fact is, at the end of the day, it's information that I willingly shared with the airlines, and I'm happy that they're using it to protect me as well. That's the real question we have here, is, can we use data that we've given to a third party, can the government use data that you've given to a third party, to try to find terrorists? We do that all the time. The NSA program is probably the most aggressive use of that. But at the end of the day, this is billing information you've given  we've all given to the phone companies. It is searched by law enforcement outside of the NSA program 1.3 million times a year. What the NSA did, at the end of the day, through the program and through the safeguards that they established for that program, they required  Yes, we gather the information, but no one can search it without articulable, reasonable suspicion passed on by a lawyer. It'll be audited. A limited number of people will have access to it. At the end of the day, 300 numbers went into that on a given year. 500  there were searches to find who they were talking to. 500 numbers came out as potentially suspicious. And only then did the government go out to try to find out whose name was associated with those phone numbers. 500 people versus  and all used for terrorist purposes, all carefully scrubbed versus 1.3 million searches done by law enforcement every day without bringing 1984 home to America. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. Stewart Baker gave a great defense of the public passenger data program that we've all known about for years, and no one has had any problem with. Of course, that's not what's at issue here. What's at issue here is whether we have a problem with the secret NSA program adopted in secret through secret interpretations of a law whose author said this would never  he never would have dreamed of authorizing this sort of program, had he known that's what the government was going to do with it. I think that's a very different question. The NSA is collecting information on every time every one of us calls or texts anybody; your son, your daughter, your mother, your doctor, your psychiatrist, your AA mentor, your old girlfriend, your new girlfriend. That's what they're collecting. It's not passenger data about people getting on airplanes. It's literally every phone call. It's doing it in secret, as I said, pursuant to a secret interpretation of a law whose author said this is not consistent with what I understood. And Rich Falkenrath says there's unanimity about this program, I don't think so. There are 30 bills that have been introduced in Congress to try to fix the problem that has now been disclosed not because of openness and checks and balances but because of Edward Snowden leaking it. And this is a program that the NSA lied to Congress to keep secret from us. When the director of National Intelligence, James Clapper , was asked pointblank, Are you collecting data on millions of Americans? he said  in Congress, under oath, he said, No. Later he said that was the least untruthful answer he could give. Well, I think I can think of two more truthful answers. One would have been, Yes, and the other would have been, We can't confirm or deny. But instead he lied to us, lied to us, why, because if we knew that this program was underway, we wouldn't accept it. Mike has suggested reasons why you should vote against this kind of spying, because it doesn't work, doesn't make us safe. I'm going to suggest that you should vote against the program because it violates core principles of a democracy, transparency, and privacy. A healthy democracy demands transparency from the government and privacy for the citizens, but it seems that today we have reversed that, with the government demanding transparency from us but insisting on secrecy with respect to the programs that it employs. We should be concerned about this because of the problems that secrecy poses to a democracy. Of course there's a role for secrecy in terms of national security, but there's also a role for democracy. And when you have an agency engaging in conduct that the person who passed the law says is totally inconsistent with the law he passed and doing it in secret and lying about it, you have a problem with democracy. National security is a compelling state interest, and it is justifiable to engage in surveillance of a range of kinds in order to keep us safe. But we have a right to have a say in how far the government goes in spying on us and our daughters and our sons and our mothers, et cetera. And we were denied that, say, and denied it in the worst possible way, through secrecy and lies. We should also be concerned about the program because it invades our privacy. Privacy is critical. It's essential to human development. It's essential to intimate relations. It's essential to political freedom. People can't speak freely when they fear that the government may well be listening in. Now, some people say, Well, you know, if you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear. But I think most of us have nothing to hide but most of us nonetheless close the door to our bedrooms, close the door to our house, put password protections on our computers. Some of us limit who can be friends with us on Facebook. We seal the envelopes that we mail. We believe in maintaining privacy because it's central to human existence. And it's particularly essential to a robust democracy that people have the privacy to engage in political discussion without fear that the government's going to be coming in and invading that privacy. Stewart suggests, Well, some  if Verizon has it, why should we be concerned if the government gets it? Well, I think there are a number of reasons we should be concerned. First of all, Verizon doesn't collect this data on every person and hold it for five years as the NSA is doing. That's precisely why the NSA is demanding it, because Verizon just gets it, looks at it for billing records, and then gets rid of it. Second, Verizon doesn't have the power to lock you up, it doesn't have the power to indict you, it doesn't have the power to investigate you for tax evasion because it doesn't like your politics, which we've seen this government do in the past. The government does have that power. And, third, Verizon doesn't have the incentive to go after its customers in the same way that government unfortunately all too often has an incentive to go after those that are critical of it. And we've seen it  we saw it in the '60s and '70s with a national security program that ended up focusing on antiwar protesters, Civil War  I mean civil rights activists, Martin Luther King, and women’s rights activists. So it’s not an abstract concern. It’s a real concern. So I think because the NSA program turns democracy on its head, demanding that our lives be transparent and insisting on secrecy for the government, you should vote against the motion."

    "data": "Thank you. I want to begin by repeating a point that Bob Rosenkranz made. This is not a debate about policy. As it happens, I can't completely speak for my colleague, Professor Dershowitz, but I would very much oppose, for example, a federal law banning guns independent of the Second Amendment, because it is very, very clear that there is a critical mass of Americans who would be vehemently opposed to that. It would just add to the divisions in the country and it would increase the number of criminals in the country, because just as with drug laws and gambling laws and the like, there is no reason to believe that such a law could generally be enforced. Most enforcement requires a willingness to comply with a law that one regards as relatively legitimate, and this law would not be regarded, I think, in that capacity. It's also true with regard to a number of other gun control statutes that are proposed that I have distinctly mixed feelings about, many of them on a variety of policy grounds, but fortunately we're not here to debate that. Nor do I think we are here to debate the one true meaning of the Second Amendment, as interesting as that topic is, and about which indeed I have written. Rather, I want to emphasize the topic that is in front of us, The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms has Outlived Its Usefulness. Now, one reason I relish this statement of the question is that I'm one of those relatively rare people, I will admit, who actually believe there should be a new constitutional convention, because I believe that a number of provisions of the constitution have outlived their usefulness. I wouldn't even say that the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms is the one that has most outlived its usefulness, but I'm really quite happy to argue that in 2013 the kinds of considerations that led to the placement of the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights, which Bob Rosenkranz summarized, I think, very well, have outlived their usefulness. So, if we were going to have a debate in 2013 about what substantive rights, as well as what structures the Senate, bicameralism, presidential veto and stuff like that, what would a 2013 or 2015 constitution look like? Would it include a substantive right in the United States constitution to bear arms? And I would argue that the answer is no. Let me also emphasize that this is a different question from whether state constitutions should include a right to bear arms. Eugene has written one of the definitive articles showing, I don't know what the current number is, but I think it's over 40, state constitutions do protect a right to bear arms, and that raises a very, very important question of whether we need to have that in the United States constitution as well. Let me give you two principle reasons why a constitutionalized right to bear arms instead of a right to bear arms that would simply be fought out in the political process, and all of us know that the political process today is tilted either legitimately or illegitimately, that's the topic of yet another debate that we need not have this evening, generally in favor of the rights of gun owners. So, let me give you the two reasons why I think the Second Amendment has outlived its usefulness in the 21st century. The first reason is precisely that it is antifederal. That is to say, one of the anomalies  sometimes very difficult to tell the players without a scorecard  in the debate about gun rights. There are many people who define themselves as conservatives who rail against a rampaging national government that believes in onesizefitsall solutions to national problems. Well, this is not necessarily what Heller decides, but it is what the Supreme Court decided two years later in the McDonald case, where it held that every state in the union has to toe a single line. Louis Brandeis spoke very eloquently of states as little laboratories of experimentation. Most states have chosen to experiment in favor of gun rights. There are some states  or cities  very dense cities, like Washington, D.C., that would prefer different experiments. Or in New York itself, one can well imagine a particular policy for the great cities of New York and a very different policy for upstate New York, where there are far, far more hunters than is the case in Manhattan, say. And one of the things that a single national constitutional amendment  as interpreted by the Supreme Court  does is to stifle that kind of federalism. And I think that's a mistake. But there's a second real problem with constitutionalizing the right to bear arms in the 21st century. As Mr. Rosenkranz suggested, the right to bear arms  or the Second Amendment  had a kind of cosmetic value until 2008. It's not that people didn't write about it. I wrote about it. Eugene wrote about it. A number of people found it very interesting. But it played remarkably little role in actual American law. Beginning with Heller, it does play a role. But what does that mean? It means that you turn over decisionmaking power to a group of federal judges who are highly divided, who have no expertise in this area, and who make often quite remarkable  even unreasoned  distinctions. Thus, for example, in Heller, Justice Scalia says that Dick Heller is protected, which I think is a perfectly plausible argument, but he suggests that Martha Stewart is not, because she actually lied to an FBI agent and is thus a convicted felon. I don't think judges should be making those kinds of decisions. I think legislators should."

    "data": "All right. Thank you very much for having me here. And it's such a great pleasure to be on the same panel with David, and Alan, and Sandy. They're all top scholars and I also reckon all of them as friends of mine. And so let me start with something I think we all agree on, on the panel. And I think probably virtually everybody  perhaps everybody in the audience agrees on too, and that is that there's a basic human right to selfdefense. And there are, of course, debates about the particular boundaries of that right. But there's a core to that right that every state in the union recognizes. I'm sure it's wellrecognized outside the U.S. as well. If somebody is threatening you with imminent death, serious injury, rape, kidnapping, you're entitled to use force, even deadly force, in order to defend yourself if that is necessary. That is very broadly agreed on. And I think it's agreed on because it is a basic human right. So I think there's little difference about that. But then there's the question  what does that right entail? And I want to argue that a right to selfdefense, like other rights, entails the right, at least presumptively, to have the tools that are necessary to reasonably effectively defend yourself. Let's take an example. The right to control whether you want to reproduce, whether you want to have children or not. Imagine somebody says oh sure, I'm all for that right, you can use birth control so long as it's the rhythm method. We wouldn't say that's a serious argument. We'd say it's a parody of an argument, right? We'd say well of course, the right to control your reproductive future involves the right to use tools that are reasonably necessary in order to effectively do that. That's not just for that right, it's also for speech. Your right to speak doesn't just mean the right to move your mouth, it's the right to use the internet, to use various other technologies that are reasonably necessary to effectively defend yourself. And guns are reasonably are necessary to effectively defend yourself. Our own bodies, you know, we sometimes can defend ourselves with that, but not when our assailant is armed with a gun or otherwise, and even if unarmed, if the assailant is sufficiently big, sufficiently strong, sufficiently ruthless, the only way we can effectively defend ourselves in many situations is with a gun, often not by shooting it. The overwhelming majority of all defensive gun users involve just threatening to use it. Just a couple of thought experiments. I'm sure some of you live in places  in houses where on the front lawn it says protected by armed patrol. I suspect few of you live in houses where on the front lawn it says protected by unarmed patrol. I would be willing to bet that. So in a sense really, those people who have the money to have armed guards, either personal bodyguards or people driving by, are already entitled to essentially take advantage of this technology to defend themselves. The right to bear arms gives people the ability to do that, even if they can't afford to hire someone. If they are their own armed guards, that's what the right to keep and bear arms allows people to do. And I think it's no surprise then that 44 of the state constitutions specifically protect a right to bear arms, and over 40 of them clearly in a way that's an individual right to bear arms, and this isn't just some weird anachronism. This dates back from the Pennsylvania constitution 1776 to the Kansas constitution in I think 2012, and several constitutions in the preceding couple of decades as well. Now, some people may say well okay, fine. It's reasonable to say there's a presumption in favor of being able to have tools needed to defend yourself, but maybe it should be rebuttable. If there's solid enough evidence that banning guns or seriously limiting guns would protect us so much that that outweighs whatever loss to selfdefense there may be, well, then we should do that. Well, interesting argument, but there is no such evidence. So, in 2004, the National Research Council appointed a committee of scholars, of criminologists. They put out this very nice report. You can read it for free online. The consensus was based on the existing studies there's no evidence that either extra gun ownership or extra gun restrictions would make people safer. Centers for Disease Control in 2005, similar study, similar result. The other studies as well from New York's own New York University: James Jacobs, looks at can gun control work. His answer, not as an ideologue on this, is probably not, at least based on what we know. Now, of course, Sandy might say all right, these are all interesting questions, but why do they need to be resolved as a constitutional matter by judges? Well, one reason might be that we do have a tradition of resolving, indeed on a national level, questions of basic human rights as to free speech, as to searches and seizures, a variety of other things we have taken them off of the federalism process. We have set them up as human rights for the country as a whole, but still one could very reasonably ask this question as to whether this makes sense. Well, I think the answer to that you have to think practically, and you have to think about what is likely to be effective in our country given the political realities. And so for that you have to ask yourself, what do you want? If you're interested in gun control, what is it that you want? Now, if what you want  so you might want gun bans or handgun bans, or you might want modest gun controls, background restrictions on mentally ill people, limits on size of large capacity magazines. You have to decide what is it that you want. Now, if you want the former, if you want total gun bans or handgun bans, well, good luck to you with the war on guns that you're going to have to get, even if you can repeal the Second Amendment, even if you can persuade people the Second Amendment has outlived its usefulness. There are going to be lots of people you won't persuade. There are 300 million guns in the country. They're not just going away. Criminals will have access to them, and as Sandy pointed out, a lot of otherwise lawabiding people will become criminals because they will insist on retaining them. Aha, people say well, but that's not what we want, right? We want modest gun controls, that's what I always hear. Probably most people do want just modest gun controls, but if you want modest gun controls the Second Amendment in court already doesn't stand in your way. Courts have routinely upheld against right to bear arms challenges. There's a wide range of modest gun controls. To be sure, there's [unintelligible] federal level in many states, though not so hard in other states, but that's a political constraint, not a legal constraint. The Second Amendment is not a barrier to the enactment of those gun control  some people think it should be. But as a descriptive matter, it actually hasn't been and isn't likely to be. But what's more, if you want modest gun controls, the Second Amendment is your friend. And any attempt to repeal it  that is what your enemy would be. Because all of those people who have been assured, Oh, I'm not going to take away your guns. Oh, if you think people are going to take away your guns, you're just paranoid  if there is, indeed, a move to repeal the Second Amendment, which I think is the implication of the conclusion that it's outlived its usefulness would be, that would turn that all  make it all sound like lies and make people worry that indeed that's what's going to happen, that people will be coming for their guns. So if you want modest gun controls  I'm not saying you should  but if you do, you should be arguing that the Second Amendment has not outlived its usefulness. Part of its usefulness  besides selfdefense  is precisely the assurance it gives to people that people are not coming for their guns, as so many people, including the president  have ensured them."

    "data": "Thank you. What a great and powerful argument. No wonder he is considered a genius. But let's think about his argument for a minute. The argument was really not so much in favor of the Second Amendment. It was in favor of the right of selfdefense. You are right. We all agree. There should be a right of selfdefense. So don't you agree with me that it would have been better if the Second Amendment had been written as Everybody has the right of selfdefense  then we could argue whether or not guns were necessary, what kinds of guns, what kinds of restrictions. You would also then have to debate whether or not guns were permissible for hunting, because hunting is not part of selfdefense. The Second Amendment reads rather differently. It starts out by saying A wellregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, then the right of the people to bear and keep arms. So, I think everybody would agree that the first clause of the Second Amendment, wellregulated militia, has outlived its usefulness. We do not have militias, state militias. They are as anachronistic as the Third Amendment, talking about that we can't quarter troops. Now, that doesn't mean that I would want to amend the Bill of Rights. I don't want to amend the Third Amendment. I prefer to leave it there, because if you start amending the Third Amendment, Sandy will have a constitutional convention. And he'll have people who might start amending the First Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment. So I'm happy to leave all the amendments there, as long as we acknowledge that the Second Amendment, like the Third Amendment, has outlived its usefulness. My point is it would have been so much better if we had established the primary right in the Constitution, the right of selfdefense. Then we would have nothing to debate. We would all agree there is a right to selfdefense. We would then be able to debate what the derivative right is from the right of selfdefense, just like we debate today as to what the derivative right of privacy is from the Fourth Amendment, the right of the people to be secure in their homes and places. But we have to distinguish between the primary right and the secondary right. The primary right should be the right of selfdefense. Of course I throw the question to my distinguished opponents: are they conceding that the Second Amendment should be interpreted to abolish the right of hunters to own weapons that are useful only in killing animals and are not useful in defending one's home or oneself? Should one have to demonstrate that one is using the weapon for selfdefense? Would you rewrite the Second Amendment, if you had the choice, and abolish the term a well regulated militia, and say, instead, The right of selfdefense, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall be infringed. It seems to me, from Professor Volokh's argument, that he would support such an amendment, or at the very least, if he had been a framer of the Constitution, he would have preferred an amendment which started out with the right of selfdefense being essential. So I think you've helped defeat your own argument by creating  a new basic fundamental right  and then deriving the right that's in the Constitution from that fundamental right. And so, the question remains, what difference would it make? The difference is fundamental. I agree with you. Basic rights should be recognized by constitutions. Virtually every country in the world today recognizes the right of selfdefense. Four countries in the world, Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, and the United States, I think, recognize the right to bear arms, so the vast majority of countries feel and believe that you can have a right of selfdefense without necessarily having a fundamental right to bear arms. It seems to me that that's a relevant consideration, and I agree with my distinguished colleague that the lavatories of democracy should be allowed to operate. And we should not federalize this constitutional right. We should not be the only leading industrial country in the world that has as a fundamental right the right to bear arms. What do the four countries that have a right to bear arms have in common? What does Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, and the United States have in common? They all have extraordinarily high crime rates, extraordinarily high murder rates, extraordinarily high death rates. I don't want to get into the argument because I agree, all of us would agree here, the statistics cut both ways. You can make arguments in favor of the fact that guns cause death, other arguments that guns prevent death, but look at the reality in a common sense way. Look at the fact that we are a country infested with murder and death and gun injuries and suicide and accidents in the home. It cannot be a coincidence that the easy availability of guns in our country has nothing to do with high murder rates. That just can't be a coincidence. Yes there are cultural differences. To be sure, Japan is not the United States, England is not the United States, but when you look at the crime rates in those countries and do all the comparisons you want, you can compare inner cities in one country with inner cities in another country and I know you can get all kind of data to support your conclusions, but at bottom the question really comes to what kind of society do you want to live in? Do you want to live in a society where we are forced to defend ourselves by guns, where the more the bad guys get guns the more the good guys have to arm and get guns? I’m reminded of the great episode from All in the Family where Archie Bunker gets to do an oped on television. And he says, The way to solve the problem of airplane hijacking is very simple. Require everybody who gets on an airplane to have a gun. That way nobody will hijack an airplane. Do you want to get on a plane in which everybody has a gun? And do you want to live in an America where everyone has a gun? If the answer to that question is no, let's acknowledge that the 2nd Amendment is anachronistic, has outlived its usefulness. Let's not abolish or amend the 2nd Amendment, let's construe it reasonably to permit gun control, to limit the ownership of guns to the right of self defense, perhaps  here I'm going to go further than you, perhaps also allow hunters to have limited access to guns. That's my position. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you. Thank you. When I'm not in New York City, I spend just about all my waking hours in one particular case in a civil rights lawsuit in federal district court in Colorado where I represent 55 of Colorado's elected sheriffs who are suing against the unconstitutional extreme and highly immodest laws pushed down on Colorado by Mr. Bloomberg's successful lobbying last spring. In the United States Supreme Court I presented briefs on behalf of a very large national coalition of law enforcement organizations in District of Columbia versus Heller and McDonald versus Chicago. Included in that coalition are the two organizations  national organizations of police trainers, the police who train the police. My clients, like the vast majority of law enforcement officers, according to every survey of law enforcement officers ever done, strongly support the Second Amendment and oppose laws which make it difficult for lawabiding citizens to own firearms for protection, because they believe that guns in the right hands substantially enhance public safety. What's some of the evidence for this belief? Well, in the United States, when a burglary takes place against a home, 13 percent of the time, the victims are in the home. It's called a hot burglary or a home invasion burglary. In contrast, in England, the rate of home invasion burglaries is 59 percent. In the Netherlands, it's 45 percent. And this is because, in the United States, people can lawfully own guns for selfdefense in their home and have them readily available for selfdefense in an emergency, unlike in those other nations. Studies of working burglars in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and St. Louis have consistently found that burglars  most burglars in the United States work quite hard, spend a large portion of their working day trying to make sure that there's nobody home because they perceive a very high risk of getting shot if they do come in when somebody is home. And in fact, in the United States, the risk that a burglar will be shot exceeds the risk that he will go to prison. And if you think prison has some deterrent value against burglary  and I certainly do  then home selfdefense has an even stronger protective value. The Centers for Disease Control is not a progun propaganda organization. They conducted a national survey in 1994. They found that that year, there were 503 thousand defensive gun uses against burglars. Usually, without  in the United States. Usually without a shot even being fired. And in 99 percent of those cases, when the victim confronted the burglar, the burglar decided it was time to leave work early. Now, if you look at when burglaries do happen against victims in the home, they frequently lead to not only a burglary, but to assaults against people in the home. If you simply take our 13 percent home invasion burglary rate and scale that up to the 45 percent rate of some other countries, that would lead to an additional half million assaults every year in this country. That, by itself, would raise the national crime rate by nine percent. Guns are not only useful against burglars and for deterring burglars, but for selfdefense in general. This summer the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine  two federal research centers  at the request of President Obama, put together an expert panel of the leading social scientists on firearms policy issues to provide recommendations for what future topics need to be researched, and also, on what topics has consensus been achieved among social scientists. What they said in their report was that the social science is clear, that when a victim is attacked, using a firearm defensively leads to a lower rate of victim injury, to a lower rate of crime completion than any other protective strategy. It is the safest thing to do for the crime victim on a broadly  broadscaled statistical basis. And they also said the social science is clear, that guns are used at least for good, lawful, defensive purposes  at least as often as they are used for criminal purposes. Of course the benefit to law enforcement of this is enormous, in the fewer victimizations; the fewer crimes, the fewer people they have to respond to and help so they can help other people. Now, why is the Second Amendment necessary today? To protect people from local, bigoted governments. It was necessary in the civil rights era, when civil rights workers frequently had to arm themselves in the South for protection against the domestic terrorist organization known at the Ku Klux Klan, when local police were often complicit with the Klan. It's why the Deacons for Defense and Justice were formed in Bogaloosa [spelled phonetically], Louisiana in 1965, to successfully provide armed protection to organizations such as the Congress of Racial Equality. It was necessary in Washington, D.C., where Dick Heller spent every day as an armed guard at the Federal Judicial Center and was not allowed by the D.C. City Council to use any firearm in his home, ever, for lawful selfdefense against a violent home invader. It was necessary in Chicago, where Otis McDonald, a 70yearold Korean War veteran received personal death threats from gangsters because of his antigang work. And Chicago said, Well, you can have a rifle or a shotgun. He knew how to use a rifle. He had been in the Korean War, but for his condition in the apartment he lived in with his physical strength and agility and the current status it was, the handgun was the right choice for him for selfdefense, and the bigoted city council of Chicago would not allow him to use that, and that's why the Second Amendment was necessary, and it's necessary in New York City right now. If you have a handgun permit in New York City, you can go on a trip. You can drive from Brooklyn all the way to Seattle and lawfully carry that gun in your car in every state across the country and it's a good secure thing to have in case your car breaks down in the middle of the night someplace on a deserted road. But the New York City police department won't let you take the handgun out of the city. There is no rational basis for that prohibition. It is purely for the oppression of gun owners to the detriment of selfdefense. It is a dangerous law and a Second Amendment lawsuit will likely be necessary to remove that. I urge you to vote against this deadly dangerous proposition to vote for public safety based on the recognition that today the Second Amendment remains vitally necessary to the security of a free state. Thank you."

    "data": "Let Anyone Take a Job Anywhere. Given current policy, it does sound radical. But notice, the resolution does not say Let Anyone Become a Citizen Anywhere. The resolution does not say Let Anyone Collect Government Benefits Anywhere. The respondent does not say Let Anyone Vote Anywhere. The resolution only says that no matter where you're born, it should be legal for you to accept a job offer from a willing employer. The resolution parallels  let any woman take a job anywhere, or let any Jew take a job anywhere, or let any black take a job anywhere. The resolution is not a request for charity and it is not a demand for government help. It simply asks the world's governments to stop requiring discrimination against foreign workers. But most [unintelligible] arguments focus on highskilled, hightech workers. I outsourced this topic to my partner, Vivek Wadhwa. I'm going to focus on the vast majority of wouldbe immigrations who aren't highskilled or hightech. Haitian shoe shines. Nigerian waiters. Mexican gardeners. Bangladeshi farmers. Now, why on earth shouldn't we require discrimination against such people? Who would want them? You know, the same reason that we shouldn't require discrimination against women, against Jews, or against blacks. They're fellow human beings. And they count. Now, suppose the world's governments made it illegal for Ron to work anywhere but Haiti. Would that be morally acceptable, to trap Ron in Haiti for the rest of his life? Mandatory discrimination against foreigners is especially awful, because most of the world's workers earn vastly more in the first world than they ever could at home. Moving from Haiti to Miami increases your wages by about 20 times. That is not plus 20 percent. That is not plus 200 percent. That is plus 2,000 percent. Now, you could object that we're not obliged to help total strangers. You know, you'll say  but the important point is, remember, allowing someone to take a job is not charity. Let me repeat that. Allowing someone to take a job is not charity. What is it? It's call minimal decency. So, suppose that Kathleen were to get a job. If I refrain from slashing her car tires on her first day of work, that does not make me a philanthropist. I am not starting the Save Kathleen Newland Fund when I don't vandalize her car. I'm merely leaving Kathleen alone. Now, sometimes tragically, just leaving someone alone has enormous costs. For example, if someone has bubonic plague, a quarantine really is the lesser evil. If you leave the person with bubonic plague free to roam, he could kill millions of people. Would open borders wreck comparable harm on our economy? No. Every scholarly estimate of the economic effects of open borders finds enormous overall benefits. Economist Michael Clemens, the world's expert on this topic, finds that a free global labor market would roughly double global production. Now, this point he makes  double, how is it possible to double global production? Well, consider this thought experiment. Imagine there were a billion farmers stuck in Antarctica farming the snow. All right. I don't know a lot about farming, but it sounds tough. All right. Now, suppose we were to let these billion farmers move from Antarctica to anywhere else. Anywhere with decent soil, decent weather, decent conditions. Well, obviously, the billion Antarcticans would be way better off when they get to leave Antarctica. But they are hardly the only beneficiaries. The other beneficiaries of allowing them to leave Antarctica are everyone on earth who eats food, everyone on the  everyone on earth who eats food benefits from that greater availability of food. Now, economically speaking, Haiti and Bangladesh really are like Antarctica. They're countries where workers realize only a small sliver of their full potential. Ask yourself this: What is the best job that you could get in Bangladesh? Not very good. Now, wouldn't open borders hurt American workers? Some. Take me. I am a native born college professor. Thanks to a massive immigration loophole, virtually any PhD in the world can legally compete with me in the U.S. labor market. As a result, about half of all U.S. research professors are foreign born. This has slashed my wages and my career prospects. Right now, there is probably an immigrant sitting at Harvard in the office that is supposed to be mine. Now, is my sad, sad story a good argument for immigration restrictions? Sure, it's a great argument. Wait. No, it's a terrible argument. Professorial immigration is bad for me, but it's good for consumers of education. If you're glad that you didn't pay even more for your college education, thank an immigrant. The same goes for every occupation. Immigration of waiters is bad for native born waiters, but it's good for diners. Immigration of gardeners is bad for native born gardeners, but it's good for homeowners. So how on earth could we ever judge the overall effect? There is a very simple answer. Keep both eyes firmly on production. Keep both eyes firmly on production. When global production doubles, your standard of living is very likely to rise. This is not trickledown economics. It is Niagara Falls economics. Now, what about the endless, noneconomic complaints about immigration? I'm sure we'll get into an enormous number as we go on. So I will just give you a general rule for how I respond to all of them. Here is the rule: For any complaint you have, there is a cheaper and more human main remedy than mandatory discrimination against foreigners. Immigrants have used the welfare state. Let them work, but not collect benefits. Immigrants damage the environment. Let them work but tax their pollution. Immigrants vote the wrong way, let them work but not vote. Immigrants hurt well skilled Americans. Let them work but charge immigrants an admission fee or a surtax. Then use those funds to compensate native workers who lose out. If you think these remedies are unfair, they are certainly less unfair than turning honest workers into criminals just because they were born in the wrong country. To conclude, Let anyone take a job anywhere. It is the right way to treat your fellow human beings. It will transform the world for the better, and it will cost us less than nothing. Thank you."

    "data": "I'll admit, when I was first approached with this topic, the resolution being, Let Anyone Take a Job Anywhere, I thought the idea was so crazy it would be very hard to get anybody lined up on the other side. But obviously we've found a couple of intelligent people to do that. Let's think a little bit about what this means. Now, you know, I'm laboring under a disadvantage in this debate because not only am I not a trained economist, I've never even taken a class in economics. I've never even opened an economics textbook. I personally don't claim to really understand most economics. I'm not convinced everybody else understands economics that well either. But one part of economics that is very wellestablished, a very simple issue, is the law of supply and demand. Think of what production means. The two main factors in production are labor and capital. Together, those factors produce everything we have in our society. Allowing an unlimited number of additional workers from everywhere in the world to come here and take jobs would massively, massively increase the supply of labor. The result would be tremendously disadvantaging labor at the expense of capital. In effect, order workers, ordinary citizens, people basically who work for a living would be tremendously economically disadvantaged by the fact that they would be competing against a billion, 2 billion, 3 billion, an unlimited supply of additional foreign workers who would take the job for whatever wage they could. It's true, certainly, there would be a huge increase in economic production, productivity, GNP. But almost all of it, and possibly even more than all of it would be captured by capital, captured by the wealthy people on that side of the equation. In other words, what we're talking about is something that would be very beneficial for the top 1 percent, .1 percent, 2 percent, 5 percent, the wealthiest segment of American society. They would benefit, no doubt about it. Everybody else would suffer. I think that's very clear, because when you're talking about basically a hundred million or 150 million American workers, suddenly competing in an open labor market with a billion or 2 billion or 3 billion impoverished people from everywhere else in the world, they certainly would suffer. Now, let's think of what really has happened in American society over the last 20, 30, 40 years. The late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, over 20 years ago, pointed out that for two decades there had been no increase in average wage income in the United States. The standard of living of ordinary American workers had been stagnant for two decades. He said that 20 years ago. It's now been 40 years. The income of the average American has been stagnant or declining for 40 years now, which is a shocking statistic that most people are not aware of. Clearly, there have been advances in technology so that in many ways people have a much better life than they did before with iPhones, with Google, with things like that. But in terms of real income, people are basically the same or poorer than they were decades ago. And as Moynihan pointed out in the '90s, that's the longest period of economic stagnation that has happened in North America since European settlement began hundreds of years ago. Now, is it entirely coincidence that 40 years of economic stagnation for ordinary American workers is the same 40 years that has seen one of the highest rates of foreign immigration to the United States in our history? I think it's more than a coincidence. The point is, if you have a huge influx of willing workers from abroad, able to take any job they could because they come from poor countries, you're going to drive down the wages of ordinary American workers who are competing with them. Allowing anyone to take a job anywhere in effect would convert America's minimum wage into its maximum wage. And if you see the complaints right now over the 1 percent, over the wealthy elite who have tremendously benefited in the last few decades, while ordinary people, ordinary people in New York City or other places around the country have suffered, that would be tremendously exacerbated if you brought in tens or even hundreds of millions of impoverished workers from other countries to take their places. Now, the point is, when you're talking about the result of economic stagnation in the United States that has now gone on for 40 years for ordinary workers, the end result at some point may be severe political backlash. And that sort of thing is inevitable. The reason America in its history, largely avoided the disastrous political results of many European countries is that every decade Americans were wealthier and better off than they were before. That's no longer true today. And it's no longer been true for 40 years now. Allowing an unlimited number of impoverished foreign workers to come to the United States would obviously make that situation incredibly much worse. And the result would be an economic disaster. It's true that possibly 1 percent or 2 percent or even 5 percent of Americans would benefit tremendously from that change. But probably 90 percent of the American population would suffer economically. And they are the people who vote. They are the people who can protest. And their views would certainly be made known. And the result would be tremendous political backlash. We have to ask ourselves whether one reason for many of the problems we've had in the last few decades economically is because the glorification, the amplification of theoretical concepts that may look very good to pure economic theorists, people basically spend their time in the ivory tower, but don't understand that ordinary workers suffer when their incomes don't rise for 40 years. And I think, unfortunately, that's probably true today. One other aspect of the American political dynamic has been that there's an increasing centralization of politics in the hands of wealth; in other words, the people who fund the campaigns, the organizations that fund the campaigns. And when you have the wealthy people benefiting tremendously from a proposal like this, and everybody else suffering. But when the wealthy people fund the politicians, they fund the think tanks, they fund the universities, they fund the journals; it's not too surprising that some of these ideas become very common in such circles even if the end result would be disastrous for the United States. The bottom line is that letting anyone take a job anywhere might sound good in theory but it would destroy the United States and destroy the lives of ordinary workers. Thank you very much."

    "data": "You know, I've read Ron's writings. I've watched his videos. And that's not the Ron that I've read. The Ron that I've read about is not one of these Tea Party antiimmigrant people who goes around creating fear about the billions who are going to invade America and take away our jobs and so on. Those are the debates that are happening in Washington, D.C. by a small segment of Congress, which has been elected through a gerrymandered electorate. That is not the real world. That is not how Americans think. The fear we've had about Mexicans coming in and taking our jobs away, they're  and then Indians coming in and taking our jobs away, they've not been founded. Now, Bryan explained what's happening in the unskilled sector. I've been researching systematically what's happening in the skilled sector, because you have the same fear mongering happening in skilled immigration, that, My God, these Indians, they're going to come and take our jobs away. If we expanded [unintelligible] which one be [unintelligible] the American workers, we all be unemployed. The exact opposite is happening. America is the most competitive land in the world. We have reinvented ourselves over and over again. Diversity rules over here. Look at New York City. It is diverse as could possibly be. The economy is thriving. People are doing much better. Look at the benefits we've seen from technology, all of the advances that Ron talked about, our iPhones, our Googles. The fact is the world is connected right now. We have more knowledge than we've ever had. Knowledge has become free. It used to be that if you needed to get information about your health you had to go to your doctor. That's it. Now you just Google and download apps and you have medical information readily at your fingertips. That happened because of technology. And you know who's been building these technologies? Immigrants, 52 percent of the startups in Silicon Valley during the most innovative period in recent economic history were founded by immigrants, people like me, people like this audience, people who came here because they saw opportunity, they were highly educated, and they decided to bring their knowledge and their intelligence with them over here and make America a competitive place. This is what's made this land what it is. In every generation there were people like  I mean this is not Ron. I mean I could have  I've heard his  actually I've seen his writing. This was not  I don't believe what he just said over here. Every generation  in every generation there have been people who said that If we let these Irish in, if we let these Poles in, if we let these Jews in, if we let these people in our jobs will go away. And guess what happened? These immigrants made Americans work harder, think smarter, compete, and this became the only innovative economy in the world. We lead the world because of innovation, because we open our borders, and because we allow people to come in here. Now, that's one perspective. The other perspective is that I hate to tell you this but the cat is already out of the bag. How many of you check email when you go home? All of you do. Right? Now, when you go on vacation, do you check email? All of you do. Well, most of you do. Let’s say you decided to work for six months in South America and your job was highly  a knowledge job, as are many jobs increasingly right now, you'd be working from anywhere. Therefore, anyone else could work from anywhere as well. You know, this is getting a little bit off topic, but the point I wanted to make was that already we are in a borderless economy when it comes to knowledge. We are in a knowledge economy. Knowledge jobs can be done anywhere. Boeing has engineers working in four or five different countries at the same time, designing aircraft systems, as do most companies. If you  and maybe you work for large corporations. I'm sure you've had meetings with people in all corners of the world. You're working together because of what technology has made possible. We are already in a borderless economy. I live it. I have a job at Duke University, yet I live in Silicon Valley. My dean over there allows me to work from anywhere I want to work. I also work for Stanford. I also work for Singularity University. I also have a role at Emory University. I'm able to be at many different places because I can go over the Internet and now teach lectures. I can do research. I can do the things I needed to do. One of the things I've been researching is the role of women in innovation or the lack of women in innovation, the fact that they're left out of the innovation economy. It's something I feel very passionate about. I did a research project. I had a team leader in Washington D.C. I had other researchers in New York City. We needed a website; we got it built at Stanford. And we needed a video. We got it done in Estonia. I want to crowdcreate a book. I put the word out there, I'm looking for people to help me with social media. I had 300 women all over the world sign up to be my ambassadors. I wanted to now crowdedit the book. I had 500 women all over the world telling their stories. I could do within six weeks the research that would have taken me years and years to do by using the power of the Web, by using the power of technology, and by letting people work from anywhere. This is a new world. And I crowdcreated a book on innovation. This would have been unconceivable even five years ago. So you talk about the damage that open borders are doing. I'm sorry. It's happening right now. The topic we're talking about is let the jobs do anywhere. No one said, Let the migration be anywhere. No one said that a billion Mexicans have to come to the USA and take our jobs away. Because we have the unskilled jobs, which Bryan will talk more about, and we've got the skilled jobs. The skilled jobs is what most of us in this room do. They can be done anywhere, because we're knowledge workers and we're in a knowledge economy. We're now connected to the Internet. Anything can be done anywhere. And it's happening. Over the last five years, we have not seen a decrease in productivity. We've seen an increase in productivity. I'm more capable right now  I'm more connected right now. I go on Twitter and I tweet, I need some information, and I have hundreds of people all over the world now doing my research for me and providing me back what I need. That's the power of connectivity, the Web. That's the world we're in right now. And we have the free flow of information. We have open borders right now on the Internet. That didn't cause our productivity to decrease or our jobs to go away or the catastrophe that, you know, my opponents are saying. It's caused me to be more productive. It causes you to be more productive. It causes you to be smarter. Your children right now have access to the world knowledge. They just get on their iPads or their iPhones and they're connected to everyone else by social media, by Twitter. They're able to go into websites. They're able to gain knowledge from everywhere. They would hire in New Delhi or get video production done in Estonia, like I did. This is a new world we live in. It's all open. And it's not falling apart. We're moving up the ramp. This is the most productive, most innovative period in human history, when the world will come together and start solving problems. There's not going to be a mass migration to America, because as we see, from Mexico, the numbers have actually dropped. As the economy in Mexico rises, there's less incentive for them to come over here. If they can do knowledge work for us where they are and contribute to our intellect and our knowledge, they will do that. They don't want to be here. They love being where they are. No one is fleeing to America because, you know, they want to. They do it because they have to. So, let's uplift the whole world. Let's make the world a smaller place and everyone wins. It's a better world. It's a better economy. And we solve major problems."

    "data": "Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you. It's wonderful to be here in this extremely stimulating company. I'd like to remind Vivek, and the rest of the panel that our proposition tonight is let  is not Let Anyone Take an Anywhere Job. It's Let Anyone Take a Job Anywhere. And I want to ask you to consider what the world would really be like if anyone could take a job anywhere. As a theoretical proposition, it's very attractive. Economic models where other things are always equal show that world GDP would go up. But I'd like us to think about those other things, which in the real world are never equal. As John Donvan and Mr. Rosenkranz said, this is not a debate about immigration. I think immigration is a very good thing for the United States. And almost always it's a very good thing for immigrants. And most of the time, it's even a good thing for the countries that people are leaving, as they send back remittances, and transmit knowledge, and sometimes create companies and jobs in their home countries. But for a debate that's really not  this debate is really not about immigration. It's about how our societies are organized. Do you think that we should expect our government to try to manage the numbers and the kinds of people who join our societies? I don't mean micromanage. I just mean setting a fair and reasonable framework for the labor market in which both immigrants who come here and people who are born here compete. We shouldn't outsource that very important function of deciding how our societies are organized to employers. That's not to demonize employers. They're the engines of our economies. But it's not their job to pursue the public good, to pursue the best organization for the largest number of people who live in any given country. Labor markets are social institutions as well as economic institutions, and they have geography. Despite the fact that many jobs are mobile, not all jobs are mobile. And especially the jobs that are done by less skilled people into today's world are not mobile. Those jobs in the service sector, the gardeners, the food service workers, the childcare and elder care workers. Those jobs have geography. And we need immigrants to come and fill them. But we need to set a framework in which that's an orderly process, in which it is as much as possible, a legal process. We need to open channels so that the people we need to come and do those jobs can do them legally. But it doesn't mean anyone can take a job anywhere. Why? Well, as I mentioned, labor markets are social institutions. They're the main channel in our society through which income is distributed. And we have a choice of whether we want to live in a low income, low productivity society with a vastly larger labor market or whether we want to live in a society where people earn higher incomes and have higher productivity and where we import and export and  including through the web  of the services that can be done more cheaply elsewhere. Having anyone do a job anywhere, having high levels of immigration to fulfill that vision carries a lot of externalities with it. We don't  I don't think most people would want to live in a society where immigrants can't have their families join them over long periods of time. We don't want to live in their society where we don't educate the children of immigrants, we don't provide healthcare to immigrants, we don't provide adequate shelter or allow people the means to acquire adequate shelter; so there are costs associated with immigration, not that those costs aren't worth it. I believe they are. But we have to face the fact that building adequate infrastructure, supplying adequate public services takes some planning, takes some funding, takes some upfront costs. And that's a good reason to regulate our  the intake to our labor markets. I think there is also a question about values in here. I've mentioned some of them already about what kind of society we ought to live in. But it's also about who gets to decide. And I have great sympathy. I work on development issues. I work with refugees. I have great sympathy for Bryan's idea that, you know, it's a moral obligation to let people reach for the same good life that many  most people have in the United States, at least in relative terms, or in other developed countries. But the fact is that we live in sovereign states. And there's a good reason that we do. In 1648, the system was set up to end centuries of religious wars, to end external interference in the societies, in organized societies. And although we've evolved from the sovereignty of kings to popular sovereignty, I think there's still a question of who gets to decide. And I don't believe it's practical to have the  to decide for the entire world that we will have the same standard of living. We live in a real world in which immigrants, in which workers are not just units of production. They're members of our societies. And we have to make the kind of provision for people to live in the kind of societies that you want to live in. And, to my mind, is a good reason to vote no against the proposition that anyone should be able to take a job anywhere. Thank you."

    "data": "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen and thank you so much, John, for the opportunity to come to this great event and debate this important topic. It’s wonderful to get out of Washington D.C., which I call American’s only work free drug zone and lately actually it has been a work free drug zone So let me make a few points about why this is such an important topic and why for a better life you should move to a red state and I would start with one observation, which is that over the last 20 years we’ve seen in America the biggest shift in wealth in the history of this country. We’ve also seen a massive change in population of where people are living and this has had profound impact in terms of where the growth is in this country and where it’s not happening, and so if you look over the last 20 years there’s been about 30 to 40 million people who have moved addresses, moved from one state to another and over that same time period about two trillion dollars of wealth and income have moved from one state to another on that. This according to Travis Brown who has written a great book about how money walks, and if you look at those statistics and you look at where people are moving to and where people are moving from it is incontrovertible that people are leaving blue states and they are moving to red states. Now some of this of course is due to things like weather, people are moving away from the north east especially as we become an aging society and are moving to states like Florida, and Georgia, and North Carolina and South Carolina, no question about it weather has a big impact here. But it’s happening all over this country. Not just moving to better weather states. In fact if you look at the statistics, an amazing statistic about California  and I agree with Gray Davis, what a wonderful state this is  how do you screw it up so much? You know how does the state get so screwed up that people have actually started to move out of this wonderful paradise? Over the last five years one million jobs, roughly  these aren’t exact numbers, but roughly one million jobs have been lost in California, and over that same time period one million jobs have been gained in the state of Texas. That’s an amazing statistic. You want to talk about a transfer of wealth and politic power it’s leaving California, it’s going to Texas. Now I would submit to you that people are not leaving places like Los Angeles and San Diego to go to Houston for the weather. They’re not doing that, right? They’re moving there because that’s where the opportunity is, that’s where the jobs are. That’s where the kind of free enterprise systems flourish. And by the way just to continue with this TexasCalifornia comparison, because I think we’ll make this a lot throughout the debate because Texas is a prototypical red state, and California is a prototypical blue state, the poverty rate is California is not 40 percent higher than it is in Texas, which is amazing. People are always bad mouthing Texas, Oh they don’t even have plumbing in Texas and so on, the truth is Texas is actually getting very rich, California not so much so. Second point to make that you should all ponder. We are all living through, right now, what I call the biggest kind of political, cultural, and economic divide in this country perhaps anytime since the civil war. And what you’re seeing  to put it very simply if you look at the last few elections is that the red states are getting redder, and the blue states are getting bluer. And there is absolutely no question about it. If you look at what’s happened, for example, in the Southern states every election for the last four or five election cycles they get more and more Republican, for better or worse, and that’s also true of the blue states. I hail from the state of Illinois; I love the Chicago area; I love the State of Illinois. What has happened in Illinois over the last 25 years is one of the great tragedies of our country. Illinois has gone to the pits in just about every single area. It has huge unfunded liabilities. High unemployment rate, the dingbats in Springfield just raised the income tax rate by 67 percent. One of my favorite kinds of modern politicians Mitch Daniels, a couple years ago when he was governor was asked about what it was like being a neighboring state of Illinois, and just put it so well he said To be a neighboring state of Illinois in Indiana is like living down the street from the Simpsons. I thought that is a great way to put it. And so we are seeing incredible dysfunction in these blue states, and it’s a tragedy by the way. And then you ask the question Why are people moving from blue states to red states? And I would submit to you the answer is very clear from the evidence why people are moving. The two biggest factors, according to all the academic and economic research, are number one: if a state is a right to work state, that is that they do not force unions in their state, and allow every worker to have the right to choose whether they want to join a union or not, those states are flourishing. And one of the fun things about working at the Wall Street journal, we talk to business owners all the time, big and small, from the corporate fortune 100 companies to small entrepreneurial companies, they always tell us when they’re talking about setting up a new plant or a new warehouse the first question they ask about a state where they’re going to locate is is it a right to work state? Because it it’s not a right to work state it’s simply, they just take it off the list. No matter how many other kind of incentive systems they might have to move there, if you’re not a right to work state you’re just not in the game to get these new enterprises. By the way people are always talking about America losing its auto industry, and auto jobs. You know America’s not losing its auto jobs, it’s just the auto jobs aren’t in states like Ohio and Michigan anymore. The auto jobs are now in the South, right? And that’s partly because of the fact that those are right to work states. The second factor that matters a whole heck of a lot is whether a state has no income tax, or low income taxes. And we find this to be highly predictable for where people move. And so for example in this great country of ours there are nine states that have no income tax. States like Texas, states like Florida, states like Tennessee, states like Wyoming, states like Nevada, states like Washington. Those states over the last 10, 20, 30 years no matter what kind of period you want to look at, have been producing about two to three times a many jobs per year as the nine or 10 states that have  If you don't want to live in a place like Detroit get to a red state."

    "data": "Thank you, John. Bob Rosenkranz, thank you. Intelligence Squared, thank you so much for hosting this. And I want to welcome my esteemed colleagues both for and against this proposition. As Steve indicated, this red state/blue state deal is really not so much about geography as it is about a state of mind. And those of us in the blue states have a different idea about economic development. We believe John Kennedy had it right when he said, A rising tide will lift all boats, because we try and provide economic opportunity for everybody, and we do that with four simple ideas. One, invest in education. Invest in infrastructure. Protect the environment and have a stable safety net. We think that all makes economic sense. We think it is morally the right thing to do. And the numbers prove that we are right. If you look at the top 10 states by average income, nine, nine are blue, one is red. If you look at the top 10 states by gross domestic product, eight are blue, two are red. If you look at the bottom 10 states by gross domestic product, nine are red, one is blue. Beyond just economics, if you live in a blue state you're going to live longer, you're going to be healthier, you're probably going to have a college degree, and you're going to have more opportunity. Now, let me talk a little bit about California, which is definitely a blue state, but was not before 1992. But today it is really a blue state. Despite what our critics say, these are indisputable facts. California has more Fortune 500 companies headquartered than any other state, 54. California is the leading manufacturing state by far in America, both by jobs and total dollar output; in 2011, $230 billion. California is the largest agricultural state in America by dollar output. California created more jobs last year than Texas, and more jobs in the last year than anyone in the nation. Most importantly, people believe in California and they invest their dollars. California gets more direct investment from other countries than any other state. And this is the statistic that's going to blow your mind. On venture capital, that's people putting their money in startups, in 2011, the last year we have statistics for, California got more venture capital than all the other 49 states put together, and it got more money from foreign countries investing in California. So, people are putting their money where they think they can get the best return and they believe that best return is in California. My point is, to live well, to be healthy, to have more opportunity, to be better educated, you want to live in a blue state. Vote no on the proposition that someone has to force you to move to a red state to live well."

    "data": "Thank you, John, and I agree with the governor. Thank you, Bob, for sponsoring Intelligence Squared. I love the format. Thanks to the Philanthropy Roundtable for hosting us today and to my colleagues, both the wrong and right  It’s good to have you here, I have both the disadvantage and advantage today, my disadvantage is that I’m a talk show host and that means five days a week, three hours a day, 15 segments a day, 75 segments a week I do this. Six minutes is an extended commercial break, it’s not a segment. My advantage, however, is I have a book coming out on the very last day of this year called The Happiest Life and I have spent the last year immersed in the details of the emerging science of happiness, begun 15 years ago by my colleague Dennis Prager with the book Happiness Is A Serious Problem and now most recently by Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute, in his book the Road to Freedom,  happiness is quantifiable. You can figure out what makes people happy and what makes people happy is more to be found in the red states then the blue states. Now I present that to you in a way that I think many of you will know or be familiar, because many of you share in common with me a friend, Dr. Jack Templeton. Jack likes thought experiments, right? You’ve been in those thought experiments with Jack where you reframe the question. Here’s how I’m going to reframe it for you, if your son and daughter approaches you and says Mom, Dad, my company, the government, the military, has come to me and said I’m getting moved one more time. They’re in their 20s. And they’re going to drop me into a blue state or a red state, I get to pick blue or red. I don’t get to pick the city, I don’t get to pick the state, I don’t get to pick rural or urban, I don’t get to pick suburban or where in that state, I just get to pick blue or red, what do you think? It’s kind of a Rawlsian construct, right? You don’t know where they’re going to end up just red or blue. Four reasons to say to him son or daughter, red. Number one, when you get there, you’re going to want to buy a house, California is 200 percent above the median cost in the average house in America. California is below that median. New York is 150 percent. Highest mortgage debt is in California, highest mortgage debt is in the District of Columbia. You want your child to be able to buy a house and begin that American dream, send them to a red state. Number two, you’re going to want them to have kids, right? You want to be grandparents. Everybody wants to be a grandparent, I just became a grandparent; it’s a great thing. Guess where the fertility is? Guess where people are actually having families and babies, the top 10 most fertile states are red. The 10 least fertile states are blue. I want to read that blue list to you, because it really is blue, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, they’re going to way of Russia and Spain, they will not be there in 10 years because they’re not any children. But more importantly  actually that’s just an indication of other things. Volunteerism is spread out evenly across red and blue states, but not charitable giving. As you will know nine out of the 10 most charitable states in the union are red. Now of course we got Utah and Idaho and we’ve got the Mormon tide to drive them that way but the other seven are not. They are, howeverwhat’s that an indication of? Religiosity and not merely checked off religiosity, but genuine confirmation of religious belief. Red state advantage huge on charitable giving. Number three though when you get there and you have these kids and you got your grandchildren, they’re going to have to drive around a lot, they’re going to have actual practical things to think about in the course of their lives. Number one, think about the number of times you’ve pulled into a gas station, the number of times over the life of your child is making that red, blue state decision, they’re going to pull into a gas station. It’s a good proxy for the practical cost of living, gas prices are phenomenally lower in red states, and there are reasons for that, proximity of refinery, production of the basic materials, bigger in red states. Red states are energy productive. When I was talking to Steven beforehand and he said you take the economics and I’ll take the social stuff. We didn’t really say where energy would fit, I thought maybe he would talk about energy production, but then I began to think it’s really proxy for the willingness to go and grow with what you’ve got to make it better and then finally those grandchildren of yours are going to need to be educated. Who’s doing the best? Now Michael Lind is a very experienced and savvy debater and he will throw statistics at you that will not make sense, that’s what they do from that side. But you listen very carefully to his statistics about education because he cannot defeat this one from the national education assessment study. The most underprivileged kids when it comes to education are African Americans and Latinos. The most important manifestation of educational success is bringing the bottom to the middle. The most important element of that is math and the most important grade is eight. That is the turning point where the skill set transfers over into the employment probability and possibility of those children. In the NEAS, the state that is now number two that has made the most progress over the last decade is Texas for blacks and for Latinos, they have rocketed up. Do you know what state is number 49? This one. Why is that? It’s because education, innovation is occurring in the red states. Why is that? Because they are not in the death grip of special interests that prevent the exploration of the new and the effective. That’s why if you had to pick where your grandchildren were going to be educated and you could not guarantee that they’re going to a private but they are going to go into a public school. You would pick a red state. If you were a grandma or grandpa who wanted to give them the best advantage of an exploding opportunity in the education arena. Now as I warn you again, Michael will come up and bring up SAT scores or ACT scores, and I will give him that, they’re higher in the blue states. You’ve got some legacy investments in the blue state. You’ve got some wonderful cultural advantages. You might be thinking I want my grandchild to live in San Francisco. No you don’t get to pick that. This is Rawlsian. They’re just going to go red or blue. And if you really want to think that through you’re going to pick red every single time. Thank you."

    "data": "I think I’m a pretty good debater, but I’m not as good at lowering expectations as Hugh Hewitt. The motion is For a better future, live in a red state. As a native Texan I would love to endorse this motion. Texas does indeed lead California and much of the rest of the country in a number of indices. It’s number on when it comes to barbeque. It’s much better than that pork based stuff they have eastwards. It’s number six when it comes to housing affordability, and I suspect this will come up again and again and again. Because one of the issues among us is the relative importance of housing affordability as opposed to personal income taxes and business taxes in explaining migration. So that’s the good news. Here’s the bad news for the state of Texas, and why it is not indeed surpassing California, New York, and other leading blue states, and probably will not do so within my lifetime: Texas is number one in uninsured adults. It is number 50 in high school graduates. I defer to Hugh on the rapid progress of African Americans and Latinos in Texas. That’s coming from a very, very low base, let’s face it. When it comes to uninsured children, Texas is number two. We heard a lot about fertility in Texas, and that’s true in the south and southwest in general, for ethnic and religious reasons. Texas on a scale from one to 50 is number 49 when it comes to prenatal care for pregnant women. So yes more women are pregnant, but they get absolutely abysmal prenatal care compared to most of the blue states. Just a couple more points on what Stephen raised. He said that $2 trillion has moved across state lines in the last 20 years. Well the average GDP in the U.S. annually is 14 or 15 trillion if I’m not mistaken, so by my off the envelope calculations, that’s less than one percent of GDP over the last 20 years. This is not a terribly strong argument for their side if you ask me. The amount of migration from Texas  from California to Texas is also very easy to exaggerate. Texans move to California just as Californians move to Texas. Between July of 2011 and July of 2012 a grand total of 22,000 more Californians moved to Texas than Texas moved the other way. The number was 17,000 surplus for Texas and New York. We’re talking about less than 0.01 percent of the US population in every case. What is more, the lower your income, the less likely  the more likely you are to move from California to Texas. Now why is this important? It undercuts the thesis that high progressive income taxes are driving out Californians. Because if that were true you would expect to see an exodus of rich Californians. What you’re seeing instead is an exodus of working class and lower middle class Californians and we know why. There are two factors. There’s the push factor, which was the housing bubble in California. It took place almost exclusively in blue states, mainly because rich people, after the tech bubble bottomed out, were looking for new and safe assets. And they had more confidence in the economic future of property assets going up in places like California, in New York, in Florida than they did in Texas and the south. So by dramatically raising the cost of living in the blue states that did force out a lot of working class people. Often  not to the south and Texas and the Great Plains, but to states neighboring. For example a lot of the working class people who have moved for housing affordability, have gone to other blue states like Oregon and Washington on the west coast. They’re just cheaper than California. And you see a similar spill over affect elsewhere. The poll factor that is creating so many of these jobs in Texas is the energy industry. And if you look at the red states in general, where this is taking place. It's in this energy corridor where thanks to fracking from the Bakken shale up in the Dakotas all the way down to Texas to the Eagle Ford shale, you see a tremendous explosion of energy. It lowers energy prices. It helps manufacturing, all of that. That is an accident of geography plus regulatory and technological factors. If the blue states who have energy resources like California and New York, were actually to, with some environmental safeguards to emulate these red states, you would see enormous amounts of wealth pouring into the blue states on top of their advantages. So, we agree on many things. One of the things we agree on is that the south in particular has been gaining population ever since World War II, thanks mainly to air conditioning and to retirement  that will continue indefinitely. The basic question, I think, is not which states are picking up the most people or the most footloose corporations, but where are you most likely to have health care, to have decent education, to graduate from high school, and to have quality of life if you're an ordinary high school educated working American? And in that case I think the answer is clear. You would rather be in a blue state than a red state. Thank you."
