  	"data":"Thank you. I should say before we start that I haven't debated since college and that was many years ago.And that was in Canada, and in Canada a debate isn't really a debate, it's simply an alternate mechanism of reaching consensus.So this is all very new and exciting for me. I want to make one thing clear before we start and that is that this is not a debate about banning football nor is it a debate about whether there are merits to playing football. You will hear I'm quite sure from Mr. Green and Mr. Whitlock that all kinds of wonderful things happen when you play football, you learn camaraderie and discipline and teamwork. All of those things are true, and neither Buzz nor I are going to dispute any of them. This debate is about a very specific question. Right now in colleges across the country schools field football teams for the purpose of offering recreation to the players and offering entertainment to fans and students and alumni. And the question is, is that appropriate. Buzz is going to say, That's not appropriate because the players are exploited, and I'm going to say that, It's not appropriate because schools should not be in the business of encouraging young men to hit themselves over the head. Let's talk a little bit about hitting over the head. Start with a very simple -- the simple physics of football.The human brain is a mass of soft tissue that is suspended within a hard skull, right? Every time you get hit, that soft tissue rattles around inside your skull. And the effect of that rattling around is to stretch and sometimes tear the connections between your nerve cells. In the course of everyday life, that almost never happens. In the course of playing football, that happens all the time. It is not unusual in the course of a game for a player to sustain hits to the head of between 40 and 100 Gs. To put that in perspective, if you were to get in your car and not put on your seatbelt and drive at 25 miles an hour into a brick wall so that your forehead struck the dashboard of the car, that would be a hit of 100 Gs, right? If you reversed your car and went and did it over and over again so that you hit the brick wall 30 to 40 times at speeds between 20 and 25 miles an hour, that would be the equivalent of a football game. If you reversed your car and over the course of the next three months drove it at 25 miles an hour into a brick wall 1,000 times, that would be the equivalent of a college football season.Now, you're going to hear from Mr. Whitlock and Mr. Green, they're going to try and tell you that there are ways around this fact, that if we have better rules or better treatment of concussions or better helmets, the effect of that kind of injury can be minimized. That is a fantasy. There are ways to cut down on the number of concussions, but concussions are only a small part of the problem. The real issue is all of those thousands of tiny hits. There isn't a helmet in the world that can be designed that can take the sting out of those hits, and there is no way to play this game of football and remove those hits without turning tackle football into touch football, and the last I checked this was not a debate about whether we should ban touch football on college campuses. I once watched a football practice at the University of North Carolina where the players were playing without pads; they were just doing a simple scrimmage. In the course of 20 minutes, one of their running backs sustained hits to the head of 79, 60, and 30 Gs. In 15 minutes, he had the equivalent of three car accidents. Now, what's the effect of all of that neurological trauma? Well, we know. It's a condition called, CTE, which brings about premature death and the equivalent of Alzheimer's in people who are as young as 40 years old. I've seen pictures of the brain scans of people with CTE and it looks like someone drove a truck across their brain. Now, we don't know how many ex-football players have this condition because you can't diagnose it until they die, until you do an autopsy of your brain, but there are people who estimate there are as many as 20 percent of football players who have this condition. And we also know that there are players as young as 18 years old who have been diagnosed with CTE. It’s a problem that begins in high school and is made worse during college.Now, I have no problem whatsoever with grown men in full possession of the facts and risks of the game choosing to participate in a potentially lethal profession, right? I have no problem with people who smoke cigarettes, I have no problem with people who do deep sea diving, I have no problem with people who want to drive their motorcycle without a helmet on. If you want to play Russian roulette with your brain, fine. But college is a very, very different matter. Every single college in this country, rich or poor, big or small, is supported by the taxpayer dollars of the people in this room. They are subsidized by us, they are given immunity from taxes, they are supported by laws of Congress, by acts of local legislatures. They are in every way funded by the people in this room. And the reason for that special relationship between us and the world of higher education is that they are charged with a sacred trust, and that is to prepare the minds of young men and women to lead lives -- the minds of young -- to lead productive lives as full citizens of the United States. And nowhere, nowhere, in that social contract does it say that it’s okay to promote and encourage young men to hit themselves over and over again in the head in the name of entertainment. Thank you."

  	"data":"Thank you. Can I have the two minutes Malcolm didn’t use? Okay. When I was first asked to do this, I -- of course I asked permission from my wife, as any good husband will, and when she said, “Well, you know, what’s the debate?” I said, “Ban college football or not.” She said, “Well, that’s ludicrous. You know, you’ll win that debate.” I said, “Yeah.” She said, “You can win the debate, can’t you?” I said, “Absolutely.” She said, “Well, who are you debating?” I said, “Buzz Bissinger, Malcolm Gladwell.” She said, “You’ve had too many concussions.”And I have. And I have. And I agree with our opponents, Mr. Gladwell and Mr. Bissinger, in a lot of ways. Football is a brutal game and I have grave concerns about concussions and the impact of concussions. I also agree that I think college football players, because of the revenues that they generate, should be paid I think a small stipend. I think that they deserve that. And so in some ways I do agree with them. But banning college football -- I mean, so I had to first -- I had to get over my initial horror at the notion because, of course, football for me has done a lot of tremendous things. And then I looked at, you know, just our country, our society in general, and I thought about football and what it does in the colleges and how it’s a unifier. Not just the guys on the teams, not just unifying people from different places and different ethnicities and different religions into one solid unit that learns to work together, but unifying a campus, unifying the students, unifying the faculty, unifying the alumni, unifying sometimes entire towns, communities, and whole cities. And so, in that respect, to me, I said, you know, “How could we? How could we ban” -- college football is a wonderful thing. But then I wanted to look at it and I wanted to look at the numbers, because obviously my opponents are highly intelligent men, they’re passionate men, they’re very learned, and I said, you know, “What is it? What’s behind this?” And so I looked into the numbers as far as what does college football -- what are the benefits of college football and what are the detriments? Well, the detriments certainly are the head injuries. Now, I’ve got to say this because we’ve got to get things straight from the beginning about the concussions and the g-forces, because Mr. Gladwell talked about 100 g-forces when you hit your head into a brick wall at 25 miles an hour 30 times a game. That does not happen in a college football game. That does not happen in an NFL football game because when you get hit at 120 -- at 100 Gs, you get a concussion, and when you get a concussion, now more than ever, you are taken out of the game and you are put into some rehab program. Now, back when I played, back when Jason played, it wasn't like that. It was -- do you know where you are? No. How many fingers do I have up? Four. Okay. That's close enough. You're ready to go back in. It's not like that anymore. And so the game is evolving to become safer and safer, as safe as it can be. But it will never be completely safe. It won't be completely safe. So what I said to myself is, well, let me look at some things that are maybe as unsafe or maybe even more unsafe than playing the game of football. And so, of course, automobile accidents came to mind because the mortality rate is about a hundred times higher for men in that age range that they're going to die in an automobile accident than they're going to die on the football field. And then I said, well, look, how about -- how about going out and riding your bicycle? That's right. That's more dangerous, or downhill skiing. And then I said, well, let me look at sports. And so I went to the NCAA, and I looked at their sports, and I looked at a study that was done at the University of North Carolina. I looked at the study of the fatalities, direct fatalities and the sports that are more dangerous than football. Equestrian riding, female downhill skiing, lacrosse, water polo and baseball. And then I went to indirect fatalities, and I looked, and I found that rowing, basketball, skiing, water polo and swimming are all more dangerous than football. And so if we're going to say, well, football has to be banned, then I think it's only right that we pretty much have to ban all college sports if we're going to do it based on the risks and the safety. The other thing that I just have to disagree with, with Mr. Gladwell -- and I know this is dangerous territory for me -- but he talked about grown men. And to suggest that college football players at the age of 18, 19, 20, 21 are not grown men, it's -- that's just not true because we'll take 18, 19, 20-year-olds, and we'll send them off to Afghanistan or wherever in the world we need them to help protect our country. And those are grown men. And so at the age of, you know, majority, at 18, I think that they have the -- they have the right to make that decision. So those are the things that are maybe against. And I don't think that it's that dangerous. What are the things that are for? Education. Mr. Bissinger said, well, you know, all you get is a scholarship. All you get is a scholarship? If you go to my alma mater, that's a $250,000 plus scholarship. That's the value of that education. So you do get an education. How many scholarship football players are there in this country every year? 23,000. And the surplus from the game of football is used for what? Well, maybe it is for research, maybe it is for physical [unintelligible], but a lot of it is also used for Title 9, for opportunities for women athletes to enjoy scholarships and enjoy educations that they might never have had before. And to suggest that football and sports aren't educating, especially football, aren't educating students, I looked at that too. In the general population, students have a graduation rate of 55 percent in this country, and it's going down. It's of grave concern. NFL -- college football players in the last 25 years have gone from a 60 percent graduation rate to a 70 percent graduation rate. So not only are they being educated, they're being educated at a higher and better rate than their peers. For me, the game of football -- and I -- well, I was serious about the lessons of football on an individual basis of teamwork, hard work, perseverance and tolerance. And I know my partner, Jason is going to talk more about that when he has his turn. Those are wonderful lessons that, for me, were an education in and of themselves. So I hope that you will all vote tonight to not ban college football. Thank you."

  	"data":"Thank you. You know, it seems to me that given that this debate is taking place at a university that is one of the greatest and most innovative in the country that doesn't have football, I think this debate ends right now. Our nation is at a cornerstone. There's no doubt about it. We are questioning everything, tax rate, rich versus poor, who are we? What are we? In a very intense— the most competitive global economy we have ever faced. And one of the things that we are looking at and must look at which makes this debate pertinent is the role of the university. It is pivotal. Questions over course offerings, allocation of resources in a very difficult era as governors are slashing to the bone, dwindling money, rising tuition. And yet, a recent book by two sociologists, Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa says that basically undergraduates embrace college life, and it is shaped and oriented to nonacademic endeavors. The amount of study time has gone -- and this was by two labor economists. Study time in colleges has gone from over 40 hours in the 1960s to 20 hours in the 1980s to currently 13 hours of study time. And I believe that at the top of what has become the university distraction, the distracted university is football, is football.It sucks all the air out of the room. The amount of money that coaches make is insulting. It is insulting when a coach is making five to 10 to 15 times more than a college president. What does it say? What does it say about the priorities of a university? It says that the head coach runs the school. And make no mistake. That was the tragedy of Joe Paterno. He did run Penn State. He did run Penn State. And I know he ran Penn State because when Graham Spanier went to his house in 2004 and said, Joe, it's time to retire, he threw him out. They never spoke for 10 years. Joe ran that school. And when it was his chance to do what was the morally right thing to do, which was to go to the police, the culture of omerta that surrounds football, he did nothing except harbor a suspected child molester. This is what we're dealing with in football. A few facts in what they call the football bowl subdivision, the big 125 schools. Spending per student in those schools, $13,471. Spending per athlete, $91,053. 6.8 times as much for a student athlete. In the famed SEC, 11.6 times as much. It's become a facility arms race. $15.2 billion spent on new athletic facilities, in particular, stadiums between 1995 and 2005. 20 percent of current spending that by the way is not included in a lot of the revenue statements you'll see in NCAA reports. And that's not from me, that's from Andrew Zimbalist who is considered the leading sports economic professor in the country from Smith College. 20 percent of current spending is on facility expansion, which is wonderful except what happens if these teams stop winning? People will not go. They will not go. From USA Today June 16, 2011, more than $470 million, more than $470 million, most of it in student fees by students who do not play sports went into subsidized college athletic programs, in particular in football. And this is in the era, a national trend of declining state support, tuition increases and salary freezes. How many football programs have cut their budgets? A few did in 2010, but it's back up. It is back up. It is back up. Salaries of coaches, I mentioned it, average salary for a football coach, $1.47 million. That's up 55 percent in six seasons. A professor, 1986 to 2007, his salary went up 30 percent. The college president, 100 percent. The football coach, 500 percent. 500 percent. And I defy both of you to tell me why Urban Meyer deserves, of Ohio State, $24 million over six seasons. I defy you to tell me that. I defy you to tell me why Mack Brown deserves $5.192 million, not to mention the $850,000 bonus he will get. And I can go down the ride. Not to mention David Cutcliffe at Duke, which has a terrible football program, but we're seeing $1.762 million. And there are all these myths, all of these myths, character, character from CBS/SI poll in 2011, 7 percent of college football players, 7 percent have criminal records, 7 percent. 2,837 players, they studied the top 25 programs, at the top of the list, Pitt, Pitt, 22 players on the team in 2010 have been charged with a crime. Myth, increased alumni giving, myth, 2005, Robert Frank of the Johnson School of Management at Cornell, existing empirical literature supports that success of big time athletics has little if any systematic effect on the quality of incoming freshmen in institutions able to attract. That's the -- one of the things about football is it attracts better students…it does not. It attracts more applications but the students are of low caliber. Myth, football gives back. Untrue, untrue, and I'll go into that later. Graduation rates, graduation rates. NCAA has the most ridiculous formula, the graduation success rate, now they've included the Ivy League, it's ridiculous.And 69 percent, and what is worse, what is worse is that the racial gap between blacks and whites is despicable. I'm done."

  	"data":"See, I mean, if we lose the debate, I should be blamed because I anticipated all of their arguments and if I do it justice, I will prove how ridiculous their arguments are or just -- not ridiculous because ---- Mr. Gladwell and Mr. Bissinger are two of the brightest minds that dabble in sports. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I did not mean that dismissively. Trust me, if you've read their work, if you've read their work, they do much higher end stuff than just sports, and I'm -- they're lending their brains to sports occasionally. But again, I don't mean that -- I mean that with all due respect. We need to keep him -- I will not match Buzz's intensity or passion. I think I can match wits with him and Mr. Gladwell. Keep in mind, Mr. Gladwell is a Canadian and you guys are -- I'm not playing this for jokes, I'm being serious. We live in a republic, a democracy. Capitalism is our economic system. The thing we value the most is freedom. We're American and if you believe in freedom, you can't have the free without the dumb. You can't have it. They go hand in hand. Freedom allows you to do dumb things, things we find reprehensible. And I would agree, you can put football right in there with cigarettes, alcohol, porn, everything else, things that we tolerate and enjoy here in America, but you cannot separate them. And everything in America is connected to freedom and to capitalism and to democracy. And so you can't remove our institutions of higher education from capitalism and from freedom. You can't. We don't do that in America. We let capitalism exploit everything whether we like it or not. And so football has to be tolerated no different than Ronald McDonald. Ronald McDonald has done far more damage to America than any football coach, any of these overpaid coaches that he's talking about. Mr. Bissinger argues rightfully, these coaches are overpaid. Ronald McDonald was overpaid, Hugh Hefner’s overpaid, Jenna Jameson’s overpaid, what -- Charlie Sheen’s overpaid. That’s America. Mr. Bissinger argues in the Wall Street Journal and a little bit today that football is removed from the academic experience. He is wrong. People don’t understand football. Many football players don’t even understand football. But, and I mean this respectfully, I’m not playing this for laughs, I’m not trying to be dismissive, Mr. Gladwell, Mr. Bissinger, some of our brightest minds, have not participated in football. And many of you in this audience have not participated in football. Football, whether we like it or not, whether you understand it or not when I say it, but football is America. It is the melting pot. College football is the highest level of the melting pot. Football is the Statue of Liberty. College football. Your huddled masses, your poor, your tired, people yearning to breath free. I was one of those kids. Football was my access into the mainstream and a better life. My dad didn’t graduate from high school, my mother was a factory worker. I was the first person in my family to go off to college. Football brings the poor and the rich, the black and the white, the Jews and the gentiles -- it brings everybody together, particularly at the college level. Your high school experience, for the most part, is segregated. Your little league experience is segregated. Once you go all the way up to the pros, it’s more segregated because football is a game best played -- pardon, Tim’s an exception -- by the most desperate people on the planet. It’s like boxing. That’s why so many of the football players have hard luck stories in the National Football League. They came from nothing, they had no other choices, so they had to be good at football. But on the college level, everybody comes together. And I personally played next to -- I was a tackle, the guy next to me, right guard -- keeping it real, don’t laugh. The guy next to me was a bigot. His mom left his dad for a black man and he couldn’t get over it, and he was a bigot. We were very good friends. We’re still very good friends. We found common ground through football. College football, the bringing together of this diverse cross section of people pursuing one goal. If they understood it on college campuses, they would teach college football, they would come and study college football and learn things so that -- I’m a part of the media. I watch our major broadcast media and I watch the clueless, people that don’t have the diversity of experience that I have through college football and through life and I watch them consistently tear this country apart. I watched them do it with George Zimmerman, OJ Simpson, Rodney King. Whatever the big media story. Barack Obama. Consistently tear this country apart. The reason why -- and if people have ever read my column and understood my perspective, the reason why I never lose faith in America is because of my college football experience. I have seen people of different backgrounds overcome tremendous differences to compete for one goal. That’s what we allegedly are trying to do here in America. I think the argument to ban college football is being argued by well-intentioned people who don’t clearly understand the sport. America is imperfect. The Statue of Liberty does not promise perfection. Our Constitution doesn’t promise perfection. We pursue perfection. College football needs to be reshaped, remade, less games, less practice, less padded practice -- share some of the money with the coaches."

    "data":"I went to work for the New York Times in 1973, and I was going to say that that probably makes me one of the people who’s been in this business in this room the longest. But then I notice you’re an old crowd. My mother went to work as a daily reporter in 1942, my father began as an ad man in 1946, after the war. So, the thing that I know is that this business is always changing. So, the idea that somebody is going to defend the status quo of this business is to me a little silly. And my first point is, that we ought to remember, that this business, the business that those guys are going to defend, is a new creation. It’s at most, 20 years old. And it’s essentially— And the other thing that’s going to happen is that they’re going to talk about the news business, and that’s not the proposition, the proposition is the media business as it should be, because the news business has been subsumed by this superstructure. Now this superstructure, which essentially is five companies which dominate the landscape— Time Warner, Viacom-CBS, Newscorp, Disney, and NBC Universal. What these companies are are—listen to this—more than 1,000 independent media companies, which in the past 20 years have been aggregated into five. So what they’re going to be defending, is actually a business theory. And the theory is we bring all these companies together, and we create value. Here’s the point. That theory has been all but utterly exploded. Disproven. Break it down into its component parts. Look at its constituencies. From an audience point of view, the audience has been in flight for 20 years. Just yesterday, what we’ve learned is that there was, newspapers have lost another 10 percent of circulation, some newspapers are down in a year, 25 percent. You can see those numbers not just in newspapers, across the media landscape. Television networks, books, magazines, the music business, the movie business. And nowthe cable business. People are in flight from what was supposed to be the bastion of mainstream media. This is an extraordinary moment, it is a moment in which you see literally breakdown at every level. The… You have—it’s not only—you have an audience flight, you have an advertiser flight. What happens with advertisers, it used to be that consumer brands, you had 90 percent of consumer brand spending was in the mainstream media, that’s down to under 50 percent, why is that the case. Because it doesn’t work anymore. You have from a shareholder perspective, and this is key. Shareholder perspective, what you have is—well actually you’ve been screwed if you’re a shareholder in a modern media company. Media moguls rich, shareholders across the spectrum of these companies, are underwater, not one of these companies, in… 20 years has kept pace with the S&P. This is a devastating result. What you have is your customers, your—the consumer, the advertiser, and the marketplace itself, saying that there is something phenomenally wrong here. Technology. The media is a technology business. That’s what it is. That’s what it has always been. Technology changes, the media changes. There is no media without technology. We’re… We’ve come to a funny moment however in this business because the mainstream media is run by people who are fundamentally technology-phobes. They don’t get it, they don’t want to get it, they’re averse to it, they resist it. They are lost when it comes to making plans about it. I spent a lotta time in the recent past with Rupert Murdoch who runs I would say the leading-edge media company, and he runs it with an iron fist. He doesn’t run it with a computer because he doesn’t use one, he doesn’t run it with email because he doesn’t get email. And he can’t get that cell phone to work, he’s always kind of waving it…in the air. What you’re going to hear here tonight is that the media is necessary for the commonweal. An informed citizenry is what this nation is about. The media may be flawed but itdelivers us what we need to know. That is self-serving crap. The New York Times, is a good newspaper, sometimes. The Washington Post is a good newspaper. The LA Times before it became a bad newspaper was a good newspaper. But after that, it’s off the cliff, it’s oblivion. The news business in this country is nothing to be proud of. What— You know, I think the thing to remember here—I mean the really important thing is that something else is happening, something is… This is easy. Change—and I have four seconds—change is good. And it’s happening and we are part of it, and we’re going to all tell our grandchildren that, we were here, we saw the monster die, and we saw the shock of the new—"

    "data":"Well, you all look very young to me. It’s achallenge to try and defend the vitality of something that’s already been declared dead. And no one has been quicker to declare it dead than people who have been preachers of the mainstream media, rushing to write the obituary. But let’s— first of all, I should caution you, we should be very careful tonight, because, we can’t touch on certain topics because, we could all go to jail if we do. What am I thinking, of course we can’t go to jail, we can talk about anything we want. And one of the reasons we can talk about anything we want is because the institutions that have made up the mainstream media, not over the past 20 or 30 years but over the last hundred years, have provided the authority, and the experience and frankly, the money, to stand toe to toe with government and all-powerful institutions and individuals. For your rights, for all of our rights, and for the benefit of all of us. I have some notes here because I’m a newspaper person, I like reliability to the extent that I get it. A few years ago, we had two reporters at the Chronicle facing 18 months in prison each, on the Balco steroids story, for refusing to be tools of government prosecution and in fact for just being reporters. Well, we spent two years, in addition to the time we spent on the story, two years defending these reporters, and a million dollars. Eve Burton, our chief corporate counsel at Hearst, who personally oversaw this case, I think is here tonight. That’s something that I’m not so sure, that these other emerging operations in media can do. Do they have the money. Does Talking Points Memo which does great work have the money, to do that. Have the will to do that. And you know the New York Times the other day just said that Barack Obama, about Barack Obama, the cover-up continues. So you may like this President more than you like the last one, but you may not like the next one. Because I can tell you from the Balco case experience, that that was a concerted effort on the part of the Bush administration, to go after the press, and its ability to report. I’m standing here very humbly tonight in the very long shadows of a lotta great editors, Ben Bradlee, John Carroll, Marty Barron, Gene Roberts, who are known for things, other than encounters with large reptiles, they’re known for working to change our world very profoundly.They do stories about the deaths of 300 kids in the Washington public school system. Fraudulent fertility packages, Walter Reade Hospital took at least half a year to do, sexual abuse by— of kids by members of the Catholic clergy, the Boston Globe, a year to do that. When Bill Keller went toe to toe with the Bush administration on domestic wiretapping you may not have liked the results of the negotiations but the fact that there was a debate, served us all. Served us all. I’m not here to defend a business proposition. As, I’ve already said, the business model’s broken, so I’m not going to do that. What I am defending is the idea of sustained professional journalism done with integrity and done in the public interest. And that is something that mainstream media has supported, we’ve gotten lost in all this business model discussion and disintermediation and granularization and it just, doesn’t get to the point. Our death by the way, would be I think a little untimely for the 50 million people who still pay to get a daily newspaper, for the 74 million people who go online, a month, of daily newspaper sites, and even for the $38 billion worth of advertising that still exists. But, another issue I think that we should raise, in terms of the service that we provide, that mainstream media has supported all these years, Freedom of Information Act requests. Now, Freedom of Information Act requests are sort of like a New York apartment with a view. They’re hard to get, it’s expensive, it’s time-consuming, but boy, what a result. These are windows, on very dark places occasionally and very corrupt places. Lucy Dalglish, and I’ll read the quote, director of Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, “Access litigation has dried up, because of what’s happened to mainstream media.” And a public defender in Georgia wondered, quote, “Can underfunded bloggers, are they able to carry the financial burden of opening our courtrooms.” And that Georgia case in fact started, or was based on a case that—where the Riverside Press Enterprise, went to court to expensively—to open the courtroom. So, look. This isn’t just domestic, and it isn’t just about the government.Seth Mydans, an old colleague of mine from Southeast Asia, said not too long ago, when he shows up at places in Southeast Asia, for stories that matter to all of us…he’s often the only reporter. Well we’re supposed to be the witnesses to history. Where are the witnesses? How are those witnesses going to be provided. I don’t think they’ll be provided solely by tweets from people on the streets of Tehran. [LAUGHTER] An old colleague and mentor of mine, Max Vanzi of the Associated Press, when I went to the Philippines for the first time he said, here’s a clue. Nothing is ever what it seems. And I thought, oh, that’s a lotta help. But, the Hearst Corporation, and the Examiner at that point took care to give me five years to learn what that meant, and by the end of that five years I knew. You want to talk about corporate greed? Well, we’ve also talked about nonprofit models, the Chronicle’s been unwillingly a nonprofit… [LAUGHTER] newspaper for many years now. But despite that fact, because of a commitment to the kinds of things that I’m talking about, that are so important to us, the Chronicle remains in business. So from the New York Times taking on Boss Tweed in the 1870s, to a young William Randolph Hearst supporting blue-collar workers…the public has been very well-served by the mainstream media, and at a minimum we can’t afford to let it go, and kiss it off, because it’s entirely unclear what other form of journalism, support for that journalism, is going to be successful. I’m under, thank you very much. "

    "data":"Thank you. I’m here to tell you that you not only look young, you look good too. And I urge you to vote for the proposition because, to be blunt, I think new media is better than old media, and I think that we’re the hope for them. I think—I agree with most of what Phil said, I agree that all that investment, all the accountability that old journalism has done, is great and that we need those values. But there’s also another side to mainstream media and another side to new media. For starters, mainstream media, for the longest time, I don’t think it was always as good as portrayed or always as great as we sort of mythicize. And, for the longest time it was basically run by old white men who are left of center who are deciding how all of us view the news, the only diversity was how much hair they had left or whether they drank gin or scotch. And what new media’s done is it’s injected a ton of vitality and a ton of competition into the media. And it’s also created, it gives you ideological, racial, and gender diversity that we never had before, and it gives all of us, all us news junkies, everyone in this room obviously cares a lot about news— It gives us a whole new menu of information to choose from. I also think, I—my background is I worked at the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post and then we started Politico three years ago, so I think I’ve seen both sides of it. And I can tell you there’s probably a lot of businessmen and women in the audience because this is New York. And I think, I think your stomach would be turned if you went into some newspapers to see how they’re run, because they had profits that were so high for so long, an almost like not-for-profit mentality took on and there became distance between the institutions that were covering the news and the readers. And I think that, it led to a real disconnect between what institutions were producing and what readers wanted, and I saw this all the time when I was at those institutions, and when I was there three years ago at the Washington Post… and I include myself in that, I saw online, I saw the Web as a nuisance, I wanted to write front-page stories for a newspaper, despite the fact that I could look at the Web metrics and see that I was getting 10 or 20 times as many people reading my story online, that that’s where people wanted the news. And I think that creates a culture that I don’t think works for the modern news consumer. And what new media’s done is it’s ripped down that wall, between the institution and the reader, and it’s opened up, I think it’s made it more transparent and it’s allowed you the reader to participate more in what we’re doing and even some of you to participate in the journalism that we’re doing. I also want to clear up some of the myths about new media, because I think all the things that Phil said are really important and I think…you always have to remember that new media is in its infancy and that, it’s going to grow and it’s going to mature. And you’re going to hear stuff tonight about how there’s a demise of serious journalism, that you know, that if you look online, if you look at new media it’s just not as serious and substantive. I’ve been in Washington for 15 years, and I would say that the coverage of the health care debate, has been the most substantive, the deepest coverage, the most accountable coverage that I’ve seen of a domestic policy issue in some time. And the best of it is coming not from the mainstream media, but from outside of the mainstream media. Whether it’s Jonathan Cohn from The New Republic or Ezra Klein who’s doing his stuff sort of deep down in the WashingtonPost.com, whether it’s Politico where we have three or four reporters just doing the policy element, we have investigative reporters doing the accountability element. Huffington Post often has their reporters dispatched to this issue. Dedicates a lot of its home page to this issue. You have Propublica, a not-for-profit organization run by Paul Steiger who I used to work with at the Wall Street Journal, and the Center for Public Integrity, doing some accountability reporting and making that available to readers throughout the country. You have the Kaiser Foundation…which has stepped in and has started to produce non-partisan news about the health care debate, a lot of it about the human element of it, they have 20 reporters, that stuff’s available to any newspaper that wants to run it, so for people who care, there’s more information than ever, and it’s coming mostly from new media. You’re also going to hear about the demise of foreign coverage. And I think that’s a serious problem. But we didn’t start this fire. It was dying before new media ever came along, it’s really expensive to do foreign coverage. And guess who is actually creating that bridge until we can figure out how to finance it. It’s new media. It’s Global Post which was started by some folks over at the Boston Globe. They have 65 reporters around the country that are doing work on a freelance basis in every corner of the country. During the aftermath of the Iranian debate which was mentioned in Phil’s column, or in Phil’s comments. The best coverage was often online, Huffington Post took the above-the-fold part of its home page, and the Huffington Post gets more traffic now than the Washington Post, and dedicated it to a running blog where you had video and text and audio coming in from Iran, so you could have a peek into what was happening on the streets that you never could’ve had in the old days, and I think that is a good thing. Andrew Sullivan was doing a similar thing on his blog. He had 1.2 million visitors in one day, which is more than you would get people reading a newspaper, all but the top three newspapers that are out there. David Wood, who is married to someone that works at Politico -- he was a foreign policy reporter covering Afghanistan on the ground. Got laid off because of cutbacks at mainstream media. Who hired him? It’s American Online Politics Daily. It’s new media that’s giving these people a chance to do journalism. And I do believe that as new media matures, we’re going to take over that social responsibility of funding the expensive to do journalism, like accountability and like foreign policy reporting because you can’t cover anything if you’re not in business. And I think that it’s new media that’s going to crack the code on the business models that actually work. You’re also going to hear from that side on the demise of accountability and investigative reporting. I think new media is leading the charge and they’re leading it by keeping all the mainstream media reporters employed. A lot of the best people in the business -- Bill Hamilton was Bob Woodward’s editor at the Washington Post, one of the best editors in Washington -- we, he just came over to Politico to help do our investigative stories and our longer form stories. Huffington Post started the Investigative Fund, which is a not-for-profit arm that does investigative reporting. It’s going to be run by Larry Roberts, who is running investigations for the Washington Post. Propublica, which I mentioned a little bit earlier, has thirty-three reporters, including Jeff Gerth from the New York Times, and many other people have been doing investigative reporting for a long time.I mentioned Talking Points Memo, and Phil was saying, Well, can they make money? Is there an ability for them to finance the type of journalism that takes on government? Well, I think so. They just got another round of funding. They’re doubling the size of their staff. They’re starting a Washington bureau and they’re predicting that they can get to a path to profitability. And I believe that because Politico’s done it. In year three, with a hundred and twenty employees, doing that type of journalism, we’re profitable. And I think it proves that this works. So I urge all of you to vote for the, the resolution because new media has given journalism the tools, the tricks, the metabolism and the journalists to succeed. Thank you."

    "data":"So you look real young. You not only look young, but you look fabulous. Okay. Ah heh. I never imagined that as editor and publisher of The Nation I’d be standing here against the resolution: Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media. For a hundred and fortyfour years The Nation has challenged the limits, exposed the flaws of what we call the MSN. Let me quote an old media guy, We are witnesses to the old media order dying. But a new one is not yet born. And Jim VandeHei can talk about all of those examples. But Propublica, for example, is very keen and explicit about partnering with what might be called legacy old media publications to get the big bang they want for their stories -- the New York Times, the Washington Post. Michael Wolff, Newser basically lives off of aggregating mainstream media sites. So I think to say, Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media may get the testosterone flowing up here, but it distracts from the tough work [LAUGHTER] of salvaging and reviving quality journalism in newsrooms that will hold accountable the powerful. So I’m ready to separate my frustration with the many weaknesses of the mainstream media from a recognition of the valuable role it plays. And I would, you know, suggest to anyone to go back and look, not just twenty years ago, but at the last two years of the Pulitzer prizes or the Hellman Media Award, which I am on, and look at who is winning awards to reform, correct, shame, expose -- and it’s still largely the mainstream media. I’m not going to speak in ways I was going to about my frustration with the mainstream media. You can imagine it, from the run-up to last year’s financial meltdown and most centrally, the Iraq war. So many mainstream media outlets have operated as stenographers to power, not as tough, hardheaded reporters. [APPLAUSE] And this is a real problem, but this is not about throwing out the baby with the bath water.It’s not defending the indefensible. It is about talking about, yes, the capacity of institutions for the health of our democracy. And for someone to say, Oh, it’s just the commonweal and you’re going to hear about people who want to protect the health of our democracy, I consider quality, independent reporting a public good. And for all the frustration the mainstream media has caused us, we can’t live without it until we have some idea of what’s going to replace it. And I would argue right now, nobody has a clear idea. The fact is that nobody but institutions like the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, excluding the nutty editorial pages, and a small group of regional papers do most of the reporting in this country that the rest of us depend on to try to hold power accountable. And yeah, there are mistakes. But it’s the hardworking reporter, whether in Congress, the federal bureaucracy. You talked about Ezra Klein, Jim. Fair enough, he’s done some great work on the health care. He’s at the Washington Post. State houses, City Hall are on the warfronts, which, you know, unfortunately, we’re in a number of them. That is the expensive legwork, drudge work that allows our system to operate with even a dose of accountability. And that is expensive. So, for all their flaws, think about what newspapers -- and not just newspapers -- have done to provide a check on corruption and crooked politicians. Think about not only what my partner, Phil, spoke about -- journalists as not only witnesses to history but witnesses to oppression, journalistic enterprises keeping people safe, the most vulnerable from torture, oppression, injustice. People do awful things to each other but it’s worse in places where everybody is kept in the dark. Twitter isn’t going to feed that right now. It is building their other sources -- Global Post, one of the better for-profit models. But the capacity is not there yet. At the local level there are reports which correlate a measurable decline in the quality of local democracy with the demise of local papers. So if the current journalistic model is unsustainable -- and you may think it is -- it’s up to those in our society who care about the continued ability to function as a democracy to find ways to fund reporting and insure the dissemination of quality journalism and information. This is a transformational moment. You’re going to hear from the other side. In crisis is opportunity. But it’s not a moment to toss out what has value, despite the flaws. There is a journalistic eco-system emerging out there but it is still very fragile. And to make the divide between old and new media into something, I would argue, artificially inflated by the other side, is to pit against each other what should be evolving together for the benefit of our country. So the fundamental problem remains. Without powerful media institutions to take on the powerful on behalf of the rest of us we become more vulnerable as a society to those who would use their influence for private gain, damn the public consequences. We need a plan B and we don’t have one yet -- which, come to think of it, reminds me of how the Bush Administration went into Iraq and we all know how that turned out. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you. And thank you, Katrina. I would say that new media has a lot to learn from The Nation, which most these days resembles a blog, more than anything else in the mainstream media. And I think we owe The Nation a debt. But speaking directly to people is nothing new. And the idea that our opponents would have us believe that somehow freedom of the press and the accountability of the media to hold institutions accountable and to keep them honest -- is somehow created by this for-profit structure that my colleague Michael describes compellingly is dead and that my colleague Jim describes is alive and well, at least in terms of its voice and its passion for accountability in the new media is at odds with what the Constitution is about. The first amendment enabled the mainstream media and what have they done with the custodianship of this authority and this sense of holding us all accountable in this democracy and in doing the quality reporting that we so value? What have they done? What are we defending here? In September, The Beatles Rock Band Project was, a product,was unveiled. And it was extraordinarily successful and it was a profound argument to those in the corporate for-profit media in the music business that said somehow the means of distribution being freed from the record companies to people who actually play and use music was going to destroy music in some sense: that if the record business went away somehow music would be affected, that somehow the art form of music and the quality of music would be affected. What instead happened was people bought Beatles Rock Band because they wanted the music. They also wanted the experience of being in the band. They wanted to part of the music itself. The technology enabled people suddenly to be a part of something that they were not permitted to be a part of. Why? Because the for-profit structure of mainstream media prevented them. It’s an old story in America. When the means of distribution goes out of the hands of the small set of individuals and individual institutions that control it, change is afoot. This is a moment we should embrace. All of the institutions described by our opponents were created in times of similar transformation. The Hearst era, the New York Times, the tabloid era in American history which formed the basis of the American Revolution were all transformational moments when mainstream media was going away and new media was coming in. This is a moment to celebrate. Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media -- it should be written in the Constitution. What are they trying to preserve here? John Donvan says that I dabbled in the mainstream media. No, no, no -- I was handcuffed to the wall of the mainstream media, ladies and gentlemen. Are we preserving the office culture and mentality at a television network where the senior editor of a news program holds an office poll to bet on the ratings for next morning’s program -- that culture? The obsession with the ages of the audience, as many jokes have been made here tonight -- this is something for the mainstream media. Chasing eyeballs, commodifying eyeballs -- that’s the business. At the height of the war in Iraq, that Katrina suggests President Bush led us into, the number one news broadcast reporting on that war was owned by a defense contractor. Is that what we’re preserving here? Is there not a conflict of interest in that situation? Do we want to perpetuate that? Are we saying that the mainstream media, which has so humored these wonderful journalists who get paid not as much as the executives at the for-profit media, but we want to have them around because they hold the media accountable. They hold the government accountable. This is a disservice, number one, to the first amendment. It’s a disservice to journalism. My first job as a journalist was a volunteer. Now, I’m not saying that I would give up all of my income at this stage in my life, but the best journalists are people who don’t do it for the money. We want to create institutions that are all about doing it for the money and then we expect that the values of journalism and reporting are going to be maintained in that structure? And then when it changes and institutions like my colleague Jim describes, Politico.com -- where that I will do journalism whether I’m paid or not kind of passion comes into play -- we’re going to say, Oh, my gosh, what’s happening? We’re throwing out the baby with the bath water. There’s something wrong here. We’ve gotta stop this. No, this is how it works. We do not look to the mainstream media to preserve the first amendment. We look to the first amendment to preserve the voices of the people -- on Twitter who are holding the people accountable: on Facebook, on social media, in blogs -- who are creating media and publishing media on their own. When the means of distribution leaves the hands of the few the many benefit. Now, are we to judge the success of this transformation by who is making money or not? Is that consistent with the values of we want to hold the government accountable? We want journalism to be the Fifth Estate. This is the mechanisms of democracy. If our gauge for the health of the media is whether some folks are making money then we’ve given up at the beginning. We basically conceded the debate and I won’t concede the debate. Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media. They had custodianship of this sense of authority for quite a while. And what did they bring us? Two words: balloon boy. Iraq."

I’ve had time to sit there for a little bit and really do some study on the audience and I want to co-sign, young, good looking, fabulous and I’m thinking, hot. It just came to me while I was looking. Do I mention that because I want you to vote against this proposition, which is a per se dumb idea? Why? Number one: I should mention it’s how I get hamburgers for my family so there is a small bit of self-interest. But number two: these are really smart lawyers over here, but we got good facts. And the fact is, as opposed to what? You want us to take the weight off Balloon Boy. Balloon Boy was a trending topic on Twitter for four days straight. It’s all Twitter could talk about. They weren’t talking about the elections in Iraq, the elections in Afghanistan that have gone wrong. They weren’t talking about the bombings in Iraq. They were talking about John and Kate. Twitter, I love Twitter. I’m on there every damn day. But, but the best links in Twitter are always, always into the data stream of mainstream media. Because I work at the New York Times I’m cast here as the dad in the basement at the teen party. Cool guys over there, but us old fuddy-duddies. Well, I work at the New York Times. We have seventeen million people that come to our website. We put out a hundred videos every month. We have eighty blogs. We are fully engaged in the revolution that John talks about and we are at the vanguard, as is the Washington Post, as is the Wall Street Journal. To suggest that somehow, a hand created citizen media is going to support-- for instance, the New York Times has a news budget of two hundred and twenty million dollars, dozens of bureaus all over the world, many other news organizations, the same footprint.And we’re going to toss that out, which is the proposition -- toss that out and kick back and see what Facebook turns up. I don’t think so. Look, we’re gathered here around a bonfire and I stipulate to the business problems of the media. Larger national newspapers, some of them are doing pretty well. Small community papers are doing great. Michael wants you to think that it’s five large media companies. It’s hundreds and hundreds of newspapers, local stations representing thousands and thousands of reporters who are bringing accountability to their community every day. I live in New Jersey, which is a petri dish, a game preserve of corruption. The last time that they came out to get the bad guys in government it took three busses. Do we need fewer reporters? Do we need less accountability? The next time they’re going to need a choo-choo train, to There is, there is a delight in dancing around the bonfire, there’s a delight, in grave-dancing, I’m not a grave-dancer, you shouldn’t be either, you should vote against this proposition. The hybrid model that Katrina talked about, where old and new media gradually developed ways of dealing with the business challenges of supporting independent accountability reporting, is what’s real. That’s what is true. It feels great to throw out the babies and stare into the bathwater so let’s go ahead and throw out a few. Okay, there goes Glenn Beck… There goes Keith Olbermann. It felt great. They’re gone. And it’s true that newspapers and broadcasters have used their monopoly powers to make millions but they’ve funded reporting over and above what the culture ever had. Michael suggested the business is only 20 years old. Paper I work at has been around for 150 years… I think that part of the reason that people get riled up is it’s easy to dwell on the barnacles, but what would you really know about Walter Reade, what would you really know about Katrina, what would you really know about 9/11. A million bloggers, typing a billion posts, I don’t think could get you to the place you need to be as a citizen to make important decisions, I consume new media, I believe in new media, I love Politico, it’s a great brand build-up. But unless you got a millionaire that’s going to absorb a lotta losses to get things going— The shop I work for occasionally makes money. None of those guys can say that. Okay. The model that they’re selling you has not demonstrated a business efficacy. And so, when Jim himself described it as an industry that’s in its infancy, are we to take the old, and throw it away, and grab a nascent industry that’s done a world of good, but in very small numbers. Global Post which has been brought up. They’re paying reporters hundreds of dollars, who are there because legacy media assets put them out there, to train them out there. All of these new media enterprises, many of them, are staffed with legacy assets from old media and once those assets peter out they’re going to have to figure out a way to make money. I mean, I get it, I’m here from the New York Times and I’ve received my orders from the dark overlords of the mainstream media. They put a chip in, I gotta tell you it hurts a little bit. And they also told me, if you fail tonight, do not come back to headquarters. So keep that in mind. Look— It’s fun to build a bonfire, it’s not much fun to figure out what you’re going to replace it with. All the plucky citizens in the world, all the networked intelligence that you can come up with, are not going to give us what we need.

You hear it from our noble opponents here and you hear it in rightwing talk radio shows. I guess that’s a redundancy if ever there was one. Um I just wonder if it, it worries our friends even just a little bit to find themselves in lock step agreement with Osama Bin Laden. The fact of the matter is there are a lot of bad movies out there. There are also a lot of bad paintings, a lot of bad sculpture. You know, most art sucks, excuse me. But here in New York, I stopped in at the Metropolitan Museum, my favorite museum in the world. And I didn’t see one work of art that wasn’t worthy. And you get the impression in museums that all art is fantastic, is beautiful, is wonderful. When in fact, for every one of those paintings at the museums, there are thousands, indeed tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands that just don’t deserve to be there. With film, because it’s contemporary, even more so in, in television, with television, we don’t have the time to do the culling and the selecting where the best kind of falls away, drops away. People like to look back at the forties and the thirties and say, why don’t they make great films like they did back then? The fact is they made a lot of lousy movies back then as well. I think in 2060 they’ll be saying, why don’t they make great films like they did back there at the beginning of the new millennium? We hear about sex and violence in films as if this was invented by Hollywood. The fact is, dramatic narrative has always been brutal, always been ugly, always been bloody and sexual. Oedipus Rex, he kills his father. You know what he does to his mother. He pokes his eyes out with jagged, rusty spikes. Medea murders her own children in a jealous rage against her philandering and faithless husband Jason. Uh, not just the Greeks but Shakespeare. I'm talking now about the greatest, most venerated, most honorable, the most loved dramatic expression of all time. Hamlet ends up with nine corpses on the stage. We counted them up in class. Some of them had been run through on swords, some of them had been poisoned. Macbeth kills his own king who is a guest in his house, and he does it out of pure ambition, out of pure greed. Richard III killed his own nephews who were boys, nine and eleven years old. Um, this was not invented by eleven Jews at Paramount Studios a couple of weeks ago last Thursday. This is the way dramatic uh, expression operates. It’s all about conflict, and uh, you know nobody wants to see the village of the happy nice people. Rational discourse, even handed discussion has its place, for example right here. But art is not it. Certainly dramatic art is, is not it. Now what you hear about Hollywood all the time is crass commercialism, all they care about is, is making money. Oh Hollywood just obsesses about the bottom line. Now, Hollywood care about the bottom line? Of course it does, but what business doesn’t? That’s not unique to the entertainment business. The dry cleaner at the corner has to make the bottom line. The insurance business has to meet the bottom line, manufacturing, uh, construction. If you don’t make the bottom line, you're out of business. Everything stands on the bottom line, that’s why it’s called the bottom line. And Hollywood’s interest in the bottom line is no different from any other business enterprise. And it’s interesting to me that people who consider themselves conservatives and very pro-business, not what I believe is America’s greatest business, which is information and entertainment, which is what I mean when we talk metaphorically about this thing uh, called Hollywood. So really there is, there’s absolutely nothing unique to that. I think what the problem is has a lot to do with the fact that we are so now inundated with images. We see so much media everywhere you go, even a man at a urinal, excuse me again, will see advertising. I’ve even seen digital screens. Um, a guy my age has plenty of time, let me tell you to look at all of that stuff. And we can’t tell any longer the difference between what’s real and what’s not. There’s no more East and West. You go to Beijing and you can be in, in uh, you know, at Banana Republic and J. Crew. There’s no more men and women, that is to say, women do what men used to do and vice versa. Uh, no more renters and landlords. I know there are but in another generation it was, it, it, it was like that. Now it really, for many of us, maybe most of us in this room, it is not. I think people can’t tell the difference any longer between images and the actual things that the images represent. I was approached by a boxing, the management for a boxer, a very famous prizefighter. It doesn’t matter who it is, his initials are Evander Holyfield. [LAUGHTER] And they wanted him to move into an acting career and they were looking for material because I see a lot of new screenplays by a lot of new writers. And they wanted, they warned me though, they cautioned me that he considers himself a very religious man and a role model for young men and therefore he refuses to be seen in a movie that depicts him as causing damage, as causing harm to anybody. A prizefighter. I mean he’s made, he’s made his living, he’s achieved his fame, he has a management team that’s able to approach the professor because he has literally beat men into unconsciousness with his fist. And this is not a diatribe against the fight game. God forgive me, I love a great prizefight. In Los Angeles, it’s now impossible to, it’s illegal to own a lookalike replica handgun. You can’t tell if it’s real or not. It could be used in a crime. A real one that can actually blow your brains out is absolutely legal. I, I hold this up to you as an example of how people no longer can tell the difference between symbols of things and the things that these symbols represent. And likewise, lets look to anti-American sentiment abroad. What could be causing that? It couldn't be the ruinous policies of this recent administration. It’s got to be Hollywood movies. So much easier to, to believe that. I must tell you I’ve traveled all around the world, I'm privileged to travel all the world and, and to lecture on screen writing issues and talk to film development corporations. And we are very much loved all around the world. I had the privilege of teaching Masters classes last spring in Paris and London and imagine my good fortune that I could stand in front of you and actually truthfully pronounce that, that sentence to you. And in the lobby of the conservatoire in Paris, there are two dozen posters of movies all around the room. And this is in mean old America-loathing France. And twenty-one of the movies are Hollywood movies, are American films. Only three of them were French films. The truth is we are loved all around the world for our, our film. The films show that we’re an open society. Do we want to go back as Jim suggested in the piece that I read to the good ol’ days when everybody was white and women knew their place? I don't think so.

[LAUGHTER] I want, I'm going to start off with a movie that I enjoyed very much and that made me laugh a lot, uh forty ideas ago. But I think it symbolizes a great deal of the problem which we’re speaking about, and that was the movie Dr. Strangelove. The thesis of that movie was that the American nuclear arms and American armament in general was not driven by any real danger to our country but was rather driven by the militarism, chauvinism, paranoia of American officials, even with some bizarre root or connection in Nazi Germany. And this film in fact symbolized a thesis about the Cold War and America’s role in it that was believed by many Americans, but even more by foreigners, and that was propagated again and again by Hollywood films, namely that the two parties to the Cold War were equally guilty, equally afraid of one another. They were like two scorpions in a bottle. Unlike most historical interpretations, this was one where we’re able to find out at the end the truth of falsity. That is, we found out it was utterly false. We found this out in 1989 when there came to the fore in the Soviet Union a ruler, Gorbachev, who no longer wanted to wage Cold War against United States. And the moment that he stepped forward and was prepared to solve the issues of which we were at odds and to uh, and to stop being competitors, the Cold War ended instantly because it never was an equally two sided war. It was a war of offense on the other side, aggression on one side and, and defense on the other. A uh, a point that was consistently misrepresented by Hollywood. Still worse than that kind of moral equivalence that you could see again and again in films were people who, whom there were many in Hollywood. And uh, whose ideas were represented in many films, that said in fact, we were the bad guys. And the good guys in the Cold War were the Uncle Joe Stalin and the Soviet Union and his heirs, the emblematic figure of this view of the world was Lillian Hellman, who was a Communist but pretended not to be. And who uh, and who in fact even once, wrote a film called Song of Russia. And the film Song of Russia, Mr. Walter, was exactly a film portraying a village of the happy nice people. Except this village of the happy nice people was a collective farm which in fact in reality was a form of uh, death dealing slave labor. But brought to the screen in Hollywood as a kind of a, a Brady Bunch lifestyle, speaking Russian. This, but Hellman was far from alone in this. In fact the view that supported the other side in the Cold War was widespread in Hollywood. And in fact, a subsequent mythology was created and is perpetuated to this day by Hollywood about the reaction against this support for the other side in the Cold War. That is, we hear a lot about and we still to this day, hear about the Hollywood Ten who have been presented in one after another Hollywood film over the decades, including this decade as ten idealistic, humanitarian liberals who were persecuted by the authoritarian state of the United States with the consistent obfuscation or outright denial of the now documented fact that all ten of these Hollywood Ten were Communist Party members, and were themselves engaged in a collective effort to blacklist and suppress people who were anti-Communist and prevent them from advancing their careers in Hollywood.But you don’t have to love Stalin to hate America, and in a later era we got people who made famous and popular Hollywood films that hated America without loving Stalin, of whom the emblematic example is Oliver Stone, who created these various films of paranoid fantasies, purported to be actual history. And, and one of which the murder of President Kennedy was a coup plotted by Vice President Johnson, and another which has implied that the murder of President Kennedy was in fact carried out by President Nixon or inspired by President Nixon. Elsewhere, Mr. Stone has told us that the murder of the President’s brother, Robert Kennedy, was carried out by the FBI. And when you look around the world and see in places like the Middle East the kind of paranoid, bizarre theories about 9/11 or other things that go on in the world, these are things that I think in all likelihood are fed and encouraged by these very popular presentations in American films, by the likes of Oliver Stone, which in fact are just as far fetched as the theory that four thousand Jews didn’t show up to work at the World Trade Center on 9/11. As I said, Mr. Stone parades as if he’s a historian. Other Hollywood film makers are much more modest and don’t pretend to be making anything other than entertainment. And yet if you watch the uh, the thriller genre in recent years, you see that there’s a kind of set pattern that reappears again and again and again. That is, well as you go along in the film and you find out who is the real evil force at the inner sanctum behind the bad guys in the film, it is invariably the CIA. The Pentagon, the President, some aide to the President, or American multinational corporations. This uh, uh, this uh, current, this genre being epitomized recently by Syriana that was referred to. But I think the best representation of that is by the remake of The Manchurian Candidate. Manchurian Candidate was a film in the fifties which showed someone being manipulated and brainwashed and used for diabolical purposes by the government of Communist China, of Mao Zedong. In the twenty-first century version of The Manchurian Candidate, it’s no more Mao Zedong, it’s some multinational corporation vaguely reminiscent of uh, Halliburton or the Carlyle Group. So here we have a new sensibility, that is on the one hand, we have this evil Halliburton, Carlyle, whatever people who have actually done such terrible things as gouging on contracts that they have fulfilled with the US government. And clearly this is supposed to be more horrible to us now in our new modern sensibility than the government of China of Mao Zedong."

    "data":"I wanted to take ten seconds of my time for a nod to my esteemed colleague, Mr. Kimball for the ex-, due expression that I hope that we can all take with us, fructifying manure. And I will try and use it in every one of my speeches. Has Hollywood fueled anti-Americanism abroad? Where’s the evidence that we should be asking this question at all? Yes, there’s a lot of anti- Americanism, yes Hollywood exists. But where’s the connection? What’s the cause and effect? We have the peoples, we have people’s responses to why they’ve become anti-American in the past few years. None of them mention Hollywood. What’s the problem with the data? Now if you were to posit Hollywood as the problem, even though there is no data to support this thesis, what would be the tipping point? In other words, Hollywood has been around since the early twentieth century. Anti-Americanism has peaked in recent years. And in a way we last saw during the Vietnam War. Would anyone wish to argue that Hollywood has fundamentally changed in the past six years? What films would you point to, to support the contention? Well if you didn’t like Fahrenheit 911, what about Flight 92 and the spade of extremely patriotic movies that have recently come out? Men of Honor, Thirteen Days, Saving Private Ryan, Patriot. Well of course Hollywood releases lots of different kinds of films. But where has any reputable study anywhere found a direct tie between the kinds of films being produced at the given moment and a rising anti-American sentiment around the world? In fact, the opposite appears true. Hollywood is frequently what appeals to foreigners about America, even those who detest our foreign policy. It’s called show business. Hollywood Studios are owned by global multinational conglomerates whose goal is to maximize their shareholder value. They do this by trying to produce a product, a product that will appeal to the widest possible audience. To do this, they must do their respective best to appeal to the most broad marketplace, here and abroad. And unless you believe that Hollywood is run by a conspiracy, then all Hollywood is doing is reflecting the values of the people to whom it seeks to appeal. Now if you would argue, again, absent any data or evidence of any kind, that this somehow increases the incidence of anti- Americanism, then what you're really arguing is that American values and the values of the global marketplace are the cause of anti-Americanism. And if that’s the case, and I would contend that it’s not, then you're really objecting both to capitalism itself and to the way that Americans like to think of themselves as citizens and consumers. That sounds kind of anti-American to me, and moreover, it sounds like you're shooting the messenger. In America against the world, how we are different and why we are disliked, based on ninety-one thousand interviews conducted in fifty nations from 2002 to 2005 by the Pew Research Center, the authors write that “while the first hints that the world was becoming troubled by America came soon after the election of George W. Bush, and that whatever global goodwill the United States has in the wake of the September 11th attacks appears to have quickly dissipated after the Iraq invasion. Favorable opinions had more than slipped. They had plummeted.” And it’s grown worse since May when that was published. The most recent Pew finding showed that favorable opinions of the US had gone from eighty-three percent in 2000 to fifty-six percent in 2006 in Britain, seventy-eight to thirty-seven in Germany, sixty-two to thirty nine in France. When one looks at the results of these surveys, you see tremendous international opposition to the War in Iraq and America’s policies on global warming. If you speak with foreign leaders, you hear genuine concerns about specific aspects of US foreign policy, the refusal to agree with the Kyoto Treaty and global warming. The withdrawal from the International Criminal Court, the War in Iraq, difficulty getting visas to visit the United States. Perhaps I'm looking at the wrong polls or talking with the wrong foreigners. But I’ve yet to hear anyone mention Everybody Loves Raymond reruns as the fuel feeding the anti-American fire raging across so much of the globe. And that’s leading the whole world to, I was going to say that word but I guess I can’t say that word since this is on NPR but that’s a different uh, subject. Taking to that place down below in a hand basket."

    "data":"Now that Pew Poll that uh, was cited by Robin, uh, I have to say has some statistical problems because in terms of France, Germany, and Britain, they over-sampled the Muslim population, sampling them at levels close to fifty percent. And that accounts a great, for a great deal of the change. When considering this motion, whether you're going to support it, the real question is whether the America that you see in the generic Hollywood that constitutes television shows and movies and music, is the same America that we all live in and work in. I mean what if your only glimpse of the United States was the latest report of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton and their boycott of underpants? Um in nations around the globe, there are lots of people who have never been to the United States. Now Richard Walter has traveled the world and he said he was privileged to do so, but there’s lots of people that have not. And they’ve never come here, they’ve never met you. And so their only impression is the export of the pop culture by the Hollywood community. And that includes all of this product. It includes television, and music, and movies. Uh, an appearance on The View by Danny DeVito. And once upon a time, as Richard Walter alluded to talking about the thirties and forties in Hollywood, there’s a nickname for this, it’s called a Golden Age. It’s for a reason because iconic images were sent around the world, images of Henry Fonda, images of Clark Gable, images of John Wayne. And the world fell in love with America, and they fell in love with those Hollywood images. And there was a, a set of values. There was optimism and there was courage. And there was unshakable belief in freedom, and unshakable belief in fairness. To, to show you how much it shifted um, in the period, is it, John Wayne who was made into the symbol of America by director John Ford, the cowboy was rugged and independent and gallant and true. We move forward to 1969 when the first film that was X-rated wins the best picture. Uses the name cowboy, it’s Midnight Cowboy. And here the cowboy’s profession is relegated to that of a male prostitute. The cowboys uh, follow in the long way. But things continued in what Roger Kimball called the cultural anti- Americanism. Since the 1960s, that what people see around the world is an America of extreme violence, of rampant crime, of unapologetic narcissism, of licentious exhibitionism, and selfloathing. And this is misshapen. It’s distorted. It’s a place where even Tony Soprano would run to his therapist. And look at rap lyrics. I mean rap lyrics…not all of it, but a lot of it, have themes of assaulting women, dealing drugs, killing the police. In many cases—well, actually, almost all cases—women are described either as female dogs, or garden utensils. And the—and the export of this pop culture has increased. Um, multiplexes were built in Europe, and, uh, the, the exports have gone up to a level of 40—to 50 percent of film box office, is on foreign shores. That includes the films that my colleagues brought up, uh, Syriana and Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 9/11 which has been very popular in the Afghan case. Um, America’s recent film exports, though, took the idea of artistic license in relation to violent scenes to a whole new level. We have a whole new genre of films that are doing big box office abroad, and they deal with nothing but…sadistic, senseless, sickening torture. I’m talking about films like Hostel, which did $33 million abroad, the Saw series, there’s three of them, they did $160 million abroad. These films, Hostel’s plot is a group of young people who are traveling, who are taken prisoner by an organization that allows businessmen to torture and kill for entertainment. There’s no plot. And they lead our neighbors abroad to believe, that America is deviant, and despicable and violent. It’s no wonder that, we have, uh, heard this nickname of Israel as “the little Satan” by some of the people we’re fighting against, and they call us “the great Satan.” As a matter of fact, uh, Robin referred to studies…this isn’t a poll but it certainly is an event when, right after 9/11 one month later, angry mobs went to the local cinemas, and burnt down five of them that contained American films. I guess they gave it a thumbs-down. The, uh…the, the other aspect of Hollywood that’s very disturbing, is the way representatives of free enterprise are depicted. Business people, executives, and corporations. Um, you know, I—I would expect that in a town that, that writes scripts that every once in a while we’d see, uh, a corporate executive as a villain. But it’s almost always that way. Oliver Stone made Wall Street, named his main character Gekko, and he extolled the virtues of greed. In Syriana, as, um…you know, uh, my colleagues have brought up, which, by the way, George Clooney used the Charlize Theron formula to win an Oscar. That’s you pack up the—pack on the pounds and then pick up an Oscar. And in, in that film, there’s a business executive with a suit that explains anti-Americanism. Explains the reason America is successful, he says, “Corruption is why we win.” Hollywood hasn’t even left their remakes alone. When they remade The Fugitive, all of a sudden they have to have a pharmaceutical corporate as a co-conspirator with the one-armed man that was not in the original television show. Uh, my colleague, uh, Josh brought up The Manchurian Candidate. Which inexplicably changed the villainous totalitarian government, into a corporation. The Manchurian Corporation, what do they manufacture? So apparently in Hollywood wealth is taken for granted, it’s a zero-sum game, a finite pie, where if one person wins, then another loses. Uh, last year, there was a remake of a famous American symbol. Superman. And Superman has always been associated with the phrase, “Truth, justice, and the American way.” And if you went to the film, you noticed, there was no American way, or it was taken out. And maybe that’s because, Hollywood has manufactured a new American way that does not fit with either truth, or justice."

    "data":"Thank you. Somehow it seems that, um… our panelists, some of our panelists have the notion, that the only America people around the world see, is the one in movies and television. Do they truly believe, that these people all over the world are idiots and morons, who have no idea what is going on with this horrific war? Do they really believe that over and over again it’s a Hollywood movie, rather than the killings, the terrorism, the bombings…the friends, the relatives, the relatives that people know, who are being…subjected…and dying in this horrific situation? Do they really think that an hour in front of a TV set counters all of the news, and all of the TV reports, and all of the paper reports? Truly hard for me to imagine. Does Josh really think that the war that he advocated for has less of an effect on people than watching a movie? Or that if we follow his lead and go to war with Iran, that that will in any way…any way do anything but continue to destroy the country that we love? The country that Oliver Stone loves? The country that Michael Moore loves? The people in the community in Los Angeles who love, we may disagree with them, but the notion that we say they hate America, is one I personally find disgusting. Let me go back to 9/11 for a minute. We all remember…I was not in New York, many of you were here, the terrible time, the tragedy. And then this amazing, amazing outpouring, around the world. Embracing us. Supporting us. Offering help to us. The spectrum of countries who came forward and wanted to be with us at this time was truly something to behold. We know it from the information, we know it from the news sources, people I’m sure here have individual stories, when you would call somebody from another country and what they would say and how they would reach out to us. And then that changed, right? And then to use the Pew study which we can argue about endlessly but I think you’re totally wrong on the over-sampling issue. To use the Pew study again we saw, after the Iraq war, a big drop, right? Turkey went from 52% of the country supporting us to 12%. Britain, our ally, 83% to 56%. And Jordan from 20% to 1% had supported us, and now, over a period of years were no longer. Well, I’m absolutely sure that the reason for that was Ocean’s 11. That’s exactly the reason, or maybe it was Shrek, no, I think maybe it was Shrek, that caused that terrible fall-off to happen. That really would explain the statistical drop, right? I mean, it makes perfect sense. This was a war of choice…that our country went into. The world was opposed to us in the world—in this war of choice. Now people can argue we still should’ve done it. But we know the world was opposed to this war of choice. We invaded, we went in, we occupied a country in the Middle East with oil resources. And now, Pew study again, in 14 out of 16 countries, a majority think the world has been made less safe because of that war. I’m sure that those facts are due to Spider Man. There’s no question that that must have been the reason that people changed their thinking. Or maybe it was in Men in Black, I think that probably would’ve made the case more effectively. The war goes on, it continues, the polling numbers around the world continue to get worse and worse for the country we love, for the country we care about. America is not trusted around the world. And as a patriot, that’s a terrible, terrible thing. And that’s not because of any fantasy TV program. That’s not because of a trashy, crappy, awful movie that Hollywood’s made and…I’ve occasionally made some of those movies. That’s not the reason and we know that and I think any rational, sensible, thinking person knows where that comes from. It comes from reality. Hollywood is fantasy, gentlemen. Hollywood makes up stuff. But there’s a reality out there that trumps any kind of bad screenwriter, or salacious material, there’s a reality that’s facing people all over the world, day in and day out. And we have to look at that reality. We have to embrace and deal with the truth of what’s in front of us. This is a diversion. This is, uh, it’s not—it’s beyond shooting the messenger. This is trying to find some simple little answer, rather than looking at, truly, a terrible, terrible situation, which is going to take us amazing years and time and effort, to overcome. Which is this rising and increasing tide of anti-Americanism. And the United States says we’re not in favor of the World Court. And it refuses to sign the global warming agreement. And we hear about Abu Ghraib. And in Britain, 41% of the country says the US is a greater threat than Iran. This is not because of Barbra Streisand. This is not because of Sean Penn. This is not because of the Happy Feet movie. I think that, we must remind ourselves over and over again, what Hollywood does, is fiction. Let’s make sure that we understand that, let’s put fiction its proper place, yes, it can have some influence on people, yes, you can get annoyed at seeing somebody who’s not acting properly. Yes, you can get turned off if there’s free sex or materialism. But is that the reason, compared to this extraordinary situation, again, a war of choice, and a war where we’ve not been able to convince the world for any of the reasons— We’ve not been able to con—remember, we went to this war, the world’s opposed to us, all kinds of reasons, and we’ve not been able to convince the world of any of those reasons. Whatever the reasons of the moment are, from the weapons of mass destruction or Al Qaeda’s connection to Saddam or democracy. And we think Hollywood is in any way causing the rise of un-Americanism? It, in many ways, defies logic, and defies reason. So…I urge all of you to vote your rational selves, not to vote a Hollywood fantasy scriptwriter who might make up a notion, that yes, some silly movie was going to affect people all over the world, rather than what’s going on today."

    "data":"I'd like to welcome you all to this debate tonight. I'd even like to welcome the men to the debate tonight although of course I pity you. Just kidding. Before I dive in, I just want to say -- I just want to start with a definition. What do we mean by men are finished? We'd like you to think of this as the writing on the wall, as the sign that points to an inevitable future. What I mean by that is that in order to win this debate, we don't have to prove that there are no male geniuses, that there's no more male CEOs, that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are figments of your imagination or that all the men are any minute going to be rounded up and locked up as -- only to be released every once in a while as sex slaves. That would be -- that would be a preposterous standard. Maybe it sounds good to you guys. But what we do have to prove, and what we will prove is that the world where men dominate the public sphere and where the male traits are the ones that lead to success is the world that we are currently saying goodbye to. We are living through an unprecedented moment in history where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very radically. I'll start with the fundamentals. In 2010, for the first time ever, women became the majority of the work force. This is kind of an amazing fact. As recently as the 1980s, the working woman was such a cool new sociological phenomenon that there were several sitcoms dedicated to her existence, which many of you might remember. Now she is the majority of the work force. If you look back at your professional schools that you guys went to, law school, medical school, accounting, even business schools, you are likely to find that women are the majority of all of those schools. And last year for the first time, women became 54 percent of all American managers. Now, how are men doing these days? They're doing very, very badly. The annual income of men peaked around 1973, which is just when women started to get going. Right now, one in five men are out of work, which is the highest percentage that's ever existed. When Larry Summers was recently asked by the New York Times what keeps him up at night, you would think he would have mentioned the healthcare crisis or maybe the many, many gaps he has made over his long career, but he did not mention either of those things. What he mentioned was this one in five ratio which he described as having vast social consequences. Now, why is this happening? The very simple answer is college. Most economists agree that what you need to get ahead these days is pretty simple. It's just a college degree. But women, for some reason, are much better these days at getting college degrees than men. For every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same. So why are women getting more college degrees? It's not that women are smarter because they're not smarter. These days, men and women test about the same on standardized tests for both math and English. But women have something. Some sociologists call it grit, some call it engagement, some call it focus, some call it social intelligence. It's some special formula that's required for success these days, which women just seem to have in greater abundance than men. And this is a very new thing. Now, I imagine that our opponents are going to concede that women do better in college. But then they're going to say so what? Women are goody goodies, then they go to work, and they just flame out, and they never get anywhere else. But this is, of course, completely preposterous. For one thing, it's only been happening for about a generation and a half, and you already see the results in the economy. You already see that for women under 30 these days are making more money than men under 30. And that's really, really new. Also women are getting much more aggressive than they ever were, which is something that's brand new. And also the qualities that we think of as making a great leader are starting to be defined as more feminine than masculine which is something that my partner is going to talk about later. So now you really have to be blind not to see the effects of this all around us in the culture. We've all gotten used to the new guy antihero or what my friend at Slate calls the omega male who's two rungs below the alpha in the wolf pack. And so we see him in the Judd Apatow movies, we see him in the Bud Light commercials. He's sitting around, putting his feet up, drinking beers, basically not working and not sure what to do with his life, he's still wearing Keds and a band T-shirt even though he's well into his 40s and at an age where men in generations before were already picking their kids up from college. I just spent the last couple of weeks watching the new sitcoms for the new TV season. The theme for this TV season was called by TV Guide the emasculation of men, and here again you have lots and lots of guys playing videogames while their wives work, sometimes they work double shifts, their wives are working powerhouse jobs, and they're coming home to see their husbands play videogames. One of the guys in the sitcoms, one of the characters decided that he was going to bestow his business upon his granddaughter and not his grandson because his granddaughter had an MBA from Purdue and his grandson as he put it was a jet skiing idiot. So this is the middle class's reflection of itself these days. Now we're on to my favorite subject which is male vanity, the new male vanity.  Lose your guts, 30 red hot sex secrets. Dave Zinczenko will recognize these phrases because they come from the cover of his magazine, Men's Health. Once upon a time men's magazines used to actively flaunt their dominance and aggression. The very first issue of Playboy called women people who crush man's adventurous free loving spirit. These days they seem to flaunt male insecurity. Men are fueling the rise in plastic surgery, hair products, and waxes. If you look at the back at the 1986 Sexiest Man Alive, you'll see Mark Harmon who basically looks like an orangutan by the standards of the day, he's got hair coming out of his shoulders, coming out of his thighs, he's a really big hairy man. These days the men are waxing and primping more than I have ever done in my entire life, as we all became deeply familiar with, unfortunately, when we have the close-up of Anthony Weiner. Now, from my opponents, you'll likely hear a lot of talk about the new generation about how men are still geniuses, men are still inventors, how they drive the technology industry. I have a few things to say to that. First of all, we're talking about a tiny percentage of men, and they're more than balanced out by the men at the other end who are incarcerated or having trouble in school. It's perfectly possible that we'll have a handful of great inventors and that still broadly speaking men are finished. You're also likely to hear about the Fortune 500 list and at the echelons of Hollywood and how few women there are out there at the top. I hear this argument on nearly every panel that I'm on and my answer is always the same, duh, men have been at this for 40,000 years and women have only been at this for 40 years, so of course the world doesn't flip upside-down overnight. But the writing on the wall is still clear, men are finished, which is why you should vote for us. "

    "data":"First of all, men are not finished. Yes, yes, indeed, women are joining men as partners in running the world but they're not replacing them. Women are flourishing in ways which are unprecedented, exciting, glorious. But men have hardly vanished from the limelight. I mean, after almost 40 years of gender neutral pronouns, men are still more likely than women to run for political office, start businesses, file patents, write editorials, tell jokes. They conduct the orchestras. They direct the great movies. They blow up things. Now, I admit blowing up things is problematic. I wish they would do less of it. Men commit most acts of wanton violence. But, at the same time, it usually takes other men to stop them. The “males are in decline” crowd seem to imagine a world of consensus-building women, happily and confidently interacting and managing the new economy. They point to an explosion of jobs for nurturers and communicators, more social workers, veterinarians, dance therapists, teachers. The problem is that you can’t sustain a network of nurturers and communicators without someone paying for it. You’re still going to need ambitious, hard-driven innovators, manufacturers, engineers, construction workers, along with police officers, firefighters and the military. Now, we’re told that toughness and assertiveness, those are obsolete, fit for another age, not the 21st century. That’s absurd. It’s worse than absurd. It borders on being ungrateful and even elitist. It ignores the actions and virtues of the very people that make it possible for us to assemble here tonight and debate whether men are in decline. It reminds me of a quote by -- well, attributed to George Orwell. Orwell allegedly said, “We sleep peaceably in our beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on our behalf.” Well, the world is still dangerous, and our civilization still depends on the protection of brave men and some women who are willing to fight and die to protect us. Now, Hanna concedes that men are still at the top of the pyramid, but she says, quote, “Men’s hold on power in elite circles is loosening.” Loosening? Yes, of course. I agree. And I welcome it. But it’s not evidence of a female takeover. I mean, just think about it. Women have amazing talents. They can be as dazzling as men when they set their minds to it. But the sexes are equal. But they exercise their equality in different ways. Consider science and technology. Women now hold a majority of college degrees, and they hold most of the jobs in fields like psychology, veterinary medicine, biology. It’s quite likely women are not only going to compete with men but surpass them in these fields and, indeed, very exciting to behold. They’re just as competitive as men in those fields, if not more. But those numbers don’t hold in other fields. Math, technology, engineering -- those are fields where men prevail by huge numbers. “And give them time,” says Hanna. “Women have only just begun, and that women are in ascendancy. They’re going to gain momentum.” Where is it? I see no sign of it. According to a recent study by the Commerce Department, women’s numbers in computer science and mathematics have actually gone down in the last 10 years. I mean, if Hanna were right, these trends -- we would begin to see women taking over, or at least showing some progress. We see no progress, very little progress in those fields. Now, ask yourself, is technology finished? Is engineering finished? Is the military finished? Are dangerous jobs like working on an oil rig or being a police officer or a roofer, a logger -- are those finished Now, it’s true that minimally educated men are in serious trouble. And I agree very much with Hanna that this is a matter of grave concern. Girls do better than boys in school. They get better grades. They score higher on reading and writing tests. They’re more likely to go to college. The reason for girls’ educational success, they’re complicated and surely have something to do with a complex combination of innate and cultural differences. Teenage girls, for example, tend to pay attention better than teenage boys. But instead of declaring men finished because of their educational deficits, we should be looking for ways to make our classrooms friendlier places for boys and young men, and more conducive to their success. Why are we even having this debate about men’s demise? The reason is we are living in an era you could call “WAW,” women are wonderful. It’s a phenomenon that’s been identified by some psychologists. And it used to be fashionable to celebrate men’s superiority over women when women were truly the second sex. Fortunately, those chauvinist days are long gone. Today, a new kind of reverse chauvinism is in ascendancy, female chauvinism. Magazines, TV shows, yes, sitcoms claim, you know, the endless heroics about girl power, You go, girl, claiming that women are better at everything. Women are better leaders, women are better communicators, all around better human beings. I saw one-story that said women have better orgasms than men. The rules of the WAW game make it impossible for them to -- to win, because if women do something better than men, that's evidence of their superiority. If men outperform women, that's proof of discrimination and the continuing male culture. What you see tonight on the other side of the stage is an extreme form of the WAW phenomenon. The idea that men are finished is crazy. Men and women complement each other. We are not separate teams competing for a trophy. This is not a zero sum competition. We're dance partners like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Our fates are inextricably tied together. If one is in trouble, so is the other. Several years ago the Hasbro toy company manufactured a toy house. They wanted to manufacture -- they wanted to sell it to both boys and girls. The girls came in, and the boys. The girls played constructively with the dolls. The kids took the dolls and played house. The boys catapulted the baby carriage from the roof. And the Hasbro general manager had a brilliant explanation: Boys and girls are different. "

    "data":"How the heck did Dan Abrams, a far too old to still be single guy, not particularly known as a feminist end up writing a book about female superiority? Did he do it to meet women? Did he -- did he do it to pander? You know, it's always frustrating for me when I'm asked about a single reason why I wrote the book. I did it for both reasons, and it's worked incredibly well. Now, it has not had any substantial impact on my social life, and there is no question that that sort of silliness is what has gotten my book, Man Down, far more attention than it ever would have received. I made a case based on evidence and men's rights groups and others have attacked me, saying, He didn't use the scientific method in this book. Look, this book was, at times, a fun, tongue-in-cheek effort. So I separate it into two broad themes, chapters that at least get people reevaluating their preconceived notions and others which I think truly prove female superiority. Can I definitively prove that women are really better spies or competitive eaters or even they tolerate pain better than men for certain, or even my beloved chapter on women handling breakups better than men? I presented evidence. I presented studies, research. But certainly someone on the other side could attack those chapters. So let's put the frivolous aside and talk about the evidence that examines issues that are important. Hanna talked about women as students. They'll be better educated. They'll navigate tough economies better. They'll be better equipped for the workplace of the next generation. But I don't know. What about politics, finance, taking care of the planet? These are areas where the evidence is crystal clear and maybe just as important the trends for the future support women and also help explain why women lag in certain areas. Let's start with politics. Women vote more, period, both in number of votes and the percentage of the population. In terms of registered voters in the year 2000, 61 percent of women voted. 58 percent of men. In 2004, 65-62; 2008, with more women on the ballots, by the way, 66-62. Same thing in midterm elections in 2010. 53 percent of those who voted were female. But wait, they, we are still tending to elect more women -- sorry, more men. Four out of five being elected are men. In fact, in 2010, women gained no Senate seats. And for the first time in 30 years, lost House seats. This is true for now. But once the women voters and the men realize how much more effective female leaders are, it will not -- it cannot continue. Men will be if not finished, certainly marginalized, the very first research has come out this year evaluating men and women in Congress. The American journal for political science reported this year that from 1984 to 2004 women won their home districts an average of $49 million more per year than their male counterparts. Women sponsored more bills. They cosponsored many more bills. They attracted a greater number of cosponsors than their male colleagues. In addition, two Ohio State political science professors tracked every bill passed between 1981 and 2009 and found that those sponsored by women survived further into the legislative process, received more attention and were more likely to be deemed important overall. And as political leaders and police officers, for that matter -- you mentioned police officers -- women are less corruptible. Two major international studies, one at the World Bank development research group, one from Williams College analyzed data from dozens of countries' parliaments, plus a 93-country survey. They took a count of corruption levels within the countries. They took a count of culture, religion, education. The results were clear. The more women legislators, the less corruption in a legislature. So what the heck's going on? Why aren't there more women? I think a 2008 Pew research study explains it all. They surveyed 2,250 people, asked them about eight traits key to political leaders and whether they thought men or women were superior. Honesty, overwhelmingly women; intelligence, women; hard working tied; compassionate, outgoing, creative, overwhelmingly women, women, women; ambition, tied. The only one of the eight relevant traits where men were deemed superior, decisiveness. In that same study, though, only six percent of the respondents felt women made better political leaders. Similar results when it came to newscasters. A rigorous study done, male and female news casters reading the exact same message. The participants agreed that when it came from a woman, they viewed it adds more credible. And yet when those same people were asked, are men or women news casters more credible, they said men. There is only so long men will be able to thrive, much less survive on the fumes of past sexism and assumptions. Now, finance. You don't need to survey the attitude of the people in finance. 2009 and 2010, Wall Street Journal and New York Times published articles entitled, For Mother's Day, give her the reins to the portfolio and How men's overconfidence hurts them as investors. Both presented multiple statistics that men were taking more risks based on less information, buying and selling more often and losing more money. Female hedge fund managers outperformed their male counterparts from 2000 to 2009 according to hedge fund research by a whopping three percent. Business Week reported that when the downturn began, funds run by women lost 9.6 percent compared to 19 percent for men. Yes, women are only a fraction of the hedge fund managers. Maybe they have to work harder to get there. Maybe these are the females who are at the top of the game. But in the world of finance, numbers should speak for themselves. And all other things equal, anyone who wants to make money out to go with a woman. Finally, new studies show that women are more committed to protecting the planet. They recycle more. They're more likely to be green. They eat less meat. They take shorter trips. In part because they give and follow better directions than men. They take public transportation more. They are also better and safer bus drivers. They save gas by speeding less. They make more eco purchases. Heck, God has decided that men are finished. Between 1995 and 2008, 82 percent of lightning strikes were on men. So bottom line, why are women still lagging in so many areas? Three reasons: Married or unmarried, they're still primarily responsible for childcare; two, they often lack the overconfidence of men; and three, sexism. When number one may not ever change for certain, number two and three will.  They must. And then us men are in big trouble. "

    "data":"We would know, John. Men aren't finished. Dan may be finished. But men aren't finished. Thank you. Thank you, John, and thank you, Dan. I want you to vote against this proposition, against this misguided motion because it's preposterous. Men can't possibly be finished because as all of you know, when men are finished, they roll over immediately and go to sleep. That's not happening. Clearly men are not rolling over. Now, they will have you believe that, that is the case. It's not, if anything they continue to do what they have always done, invent new technology -- makes them smarter -- lead nations, build bridges, drive corporations, yes, win elections, and to your point quite sadly, tweet pics of their genitalia to complete strangers. That's true. Nothing's changed. Now, our opponents are arguing that men have lost their edge, that women now outpace men in both graduate and undergraduate degrees while the world's economy continues to place greater and greater importance on education. And men are certainly falling behind in this regard as you know through the mancession or great he-cession, nearly 78 percent initially of the job losses belong to men, yes. Men make up the largest sector of the unemployed, they are the majority of people in prison, in rehab, the majority of people who ought to be in rehab. And as Jeff Foxworthy might have put it, very few women say as their last words, Hey, watch this. It's a fact. Testosterone fueled accidents and testosterone fueled illnesses fell men seven years sooner than women. So how can I concede these points right at the top of this debate and still say you must vote against this measure? It's simple. All of the statistics that my opponents will be citing tonight are indicative of a trend. Women are beginning to catch up to men. But the pace of that progress is inexorably slow. According to the United Nations women perform two-thirds of the world's work, but only earn a fraction of the world's income. Men own 99 percent of the world's property and rule 92 percent of its sovereign nations. Now, I didn't get through all of Freakonomics, admittedly, but these do not seem like winning statistics for that side. Obviously, the other 150 million American males out there aren't particularly alarmed either. I don't think anybody came through a gauntlet of men protesting the topic of this debate out there burning their jockstraps. Men aren't finished. You have to vote against this motion. Now, what's going on? In part it's the biological drive. There is a women's movement for the simple reason that women are willing to move together more as a unit. Men are rugged individualists. They want to move together probably but they -- none is willing to stop and ask for directions. So that's the way that men are, and we need to move beyond our opponents' assertions that there's something wrong with that. It may not be true that the male of the species is in fact stronger, braver, or more action oriented in times of crisis, but we are certainly still asked to play an outsize role. It was still men who spent those long weeks in the Chilean mine. It’s still men who make up 90 percent of the on-the-job deaths, performing dangerous tasks at dangerous hours. It was still 343 firemen who lost their lives 10 years ago in the World Trade Center. And while women are clearly capable of heroic actions in desperate circumstances, I personally am in awe of Rupert Murdoch’s wife. We are hard-wired as a species to count on the comforts of masculine leadership. Even women who aspire to become leaders often seem to take on the trappings of masculinity. Consider Sarah Palin who dobbed such masculine traits as wearing black leather jackets, carrying a gun, bragging about how hot her spouse is. Or Michele Bachmann whose tribute to traditional masculinity includes putting down gays and trying to pretend our daughters are still virgins. Yes, women are making enormous gains in education. They now earn the majority of graduate and undergraduate degrees. And I feel terrible, just terrible, for Bill Gates and Barry Diller and Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg and Tyler Perry and Larry Ellison and Steve Jobs and all the other poor non-degree-holding men who were too busy becoming billionaires to finish their homework. Awful. It’s so tough. It would have been much better -- It would have been much better if they had just stayed at home, stayed in school, taken on their share of the more than $1 trillion in student loan debt, the majority of which now belongs to -- you guessed it -- the fairer sex. Of course, there’s self-made women billionaires -- Oprah, Martha, J.K. Rowling, imaginative visions shared worldwide. But it’s men who flood the patent offices with their big ideas. And until a woman invents the next Google or Facebook or iPad or bass-o-matic -- -- the economic inequality between men and women will not be righted in our lifetimes. So, men are driven to achieve power and influence. Men aren’t worried about losing out to women. They’re still too focused on not losing out to other men. That’s why men are not finished. And it’s why you have to vote against this ridiculous proposition. "

    "data":"Thank you very much and thanks to everybody for having this forum. It’s very interesting. And thanks to all of you for coming.The first premise that I want to propose is that the art market is a financial market now. It has become this and it is a totally unregulated financial market. I will also try to define ethical. I define ethical as a protection for the investor or art collector and unethical as efforts to deceive. I will narrowly define the stock market as publicly traded equities. Otherwise I risk sailing off into Bernie Madoff-land and uncharted waters. The art market really is divided into two parts – the private art market, meaning the galleries, and the public market, the auction houses.In the private market there are protections of the purchaser in the form of the uniform commercial code in New York and the self-policing bodies like the Art Dealers Association of America. So I’m gonna foc...-- These are not totally protective but they serve a purpose. I’m gonna focus then on the auction market. The press usually defines the art market as the auction market for contemporary art, which gets all the press – where prices have ballooned in recent years. And therefore it has become pressworthy, because big prices make for press. In the past few years there has been rampant speculation. Until the middle-Nineties a work that appeared at auction, if it reappeared within five years it would be virtually unsellable. And now works appear almost immediately after being purchased or at least they did until the recent unpleasantness in the contemporary market, starting in November. And because there’s a new wave of speculators at each auction. This all really began in the middle-Eighties, when art became monetized by the press and the financial institutions into a financial market, Sotheby’s launched a financial services arm, Citibank an art advisory department and so on. Banks lent money on art and auction houses lent money to buy art. Sotheby’s Chairman went to jail for colluding with Christie’s on auction commissions. Now art had become a serious financial asset. Whereas before the Eighties the market was tiny, it now became global. Thousands of people became involved. Billions of dollars changed hands. But except for foreign governments claiming repatriation of antiquities and Holocaust restitutions and despite the sums of money involved and vast numbers of participants, government seems to treat art as frivolous, as a luxury market with no regulation or oversight. As just one example: in the Bush Administration tax code, when the capital gains tax was reduced from twenty-eight per cent to fifteen per cent art remained at twenty-eight per cent –apparently because it was treated by the government as a luxury, not an asset class. The stock markets are highly regulated by law. There are also protections for individuals who trade in the market through fiduciary, mutual funds and so on. Regulation came about as a protection for individual investors. The art market, on the other hand, is totally unregulated. Things occur, particularly in the auction market, that are deliberately contrived to deceive the unsophisticated individual and that would be subject to criminal penalties in the stock market. The most universally encountered is chandelier bidding, which means fake bids to entice bidders into competition.Whereas regulations exist in the stock market to provide transparency, chandelier bidding is specifically designed to deceive, to imply that there is competition when there isn’t any. Novice buyers usually enter the market through auctions because they have no other way to establish values. And unlike securities, there are no two works of art that are identical or are in the same condition or have the same credentials. The only source of price comparison is auction data bases. But, again, comparisons are flawed. The novice auction bidder believes his only exposure is his incremental bid. He assumes that the under-bid represents a willing and able competitor. But if there wasn’t any under-bidder? What if the bid was a phantom, a chandelier bid? When some years ago the issue of chandelier bidding was raised in New York’s Consumer Affairs Department, the auctioneers cried that to eliminate it would take the drama out of auctions and they threatened to quit New York City. When I was quoted as saying that when I want drama I go to Broadway I was called a horse’s butt. [LAUGHTER] The only – I changed that word because my wife wouldn’t let me, or somebody in my office wouldn’t let me use it.  The only result of this city inquiry was that the auctioneers were forced to identify items in which they have a financial interest or that are guaranteed or most recently in which there are irrevocable bids identified by mini scule symbols virtually invisible or incomprehensible to all but professionals. Otherwise, the auctioneers prevailed with their deceptive practices. In addition, the auction catalog disclaimers make it basically caveat emptor, as far as authenticity and condition are concerned. In the private gallery market the invoice establishes the guarantee, by law. The real reason for the auctioneer’s ethical ambivalence is the dramatic shift in role over the last forty years from agent for the buyer. Then as demand started exceeding supply, first as agent for both buyers and sellers and then primarily for the sellers, the buyer paying almost all of the commission guarantees and irrevocable bids followed swiftly as further enticements to sellers. But the auctioneer’s role remained ambiguous. The auctioneer was now wearing at least two invisible hats and when he had an equity in the object, three."

    "data":"Well, it doesn’t seem like we have to do much, given what’s happened recently. But, my argument is a little different. I don’t think that the value of art is determined by money at all. And I – [APPLAUSE] I don’t think that the value of art is measured in that way. If you look at the turn of the century, Bugaro [PH] sold for far more than any other artist, in what would be in today’s terms, millions of dollars. And the artists that we now know and love, the Impressionists, Post- Impressionists, couldn’t sell their work at all. So I question whether sales really is a barometer of value and whether ethics has anything to do with how that work is marketed. We have examples of the work being marketed extremely well, with great ethics. And we have examples of it being done in a somewhat sleazier fashion. I would say that art is not a business. Certainly the making of art is not a business. My good friend Joe Zucker, who is a great painter, his father was a junk dealer, a scrap metal dealer in Chicago. When he looked at Joe’s studio and saw the racks full of unsold paintings, he said, You can’t afford to make any more paintings until you get rid of some of your inventory. If any of us made work for that kind of reason, you know, you wonder where we would be. I remember Lee Marvin in The Ship of Fools was a washed-up baseball player. And he’s standing at a bar, talking to an artist. And, because he isn’t being paid, he doesn’t play baseball anymore. And the artist is trying to explain to him why he has to have an occupation to support his profession. And that’s really where the art world is at. Most people, most artists make this work whether anybody wants it all, makes it year in and year out with little visibility, no critical attention and little financial support. Most artists, by nature, are mediocre. There are no undiscovered geniuses. Take my word. There are no undiscovered geniuses. There are many undiscovered competent artists, just as competent as the artists who are famous and we all know. There are no charlatans. If somebody wanted to be a charlatan the last thing they would do is go into art. There are many other ways. And I think the financial market is obviously a much better place to be a charlatan than being an artist. If you’re lucky enough to find a dealer, the artist and the dealer relationship is the heart and soul of the art world. It is a marriage. Like many marriages, some don’t last forever and there may even be some cheating from time to time. But it is a marriage because this is where the rubber meets the road when it comes to art and how it is offered to the public. There are ups and downs. Things are in fashion or out, hot or not. And if you don’t understand the cyclical nature of the art world you’re in for a lot of pain. Dave Hickey said in a really wonderful article in, in Art in America this month: At one time a consensus of professional respect would carry an artist through times of no money better than money would carry an artist through times of no professional respect. A few museum shows and a nice catalog essay during a lull meant that your prices would still be there when fashion changed and the money came back. He went on to say that works of art have no intrinsic value. All their value is extrinsic. It is invested from without and over a period of time. Damien Hirst’s jewel encrusted skull has hundreds of thousands of dollars – or it might be millions, I don’t know – of diamonds in it. It did not make that piece any more valuable than any other work of his, just because it had inherent value. I’ve got two minutes. Jesus Christ. So who are the deciders? Some are forces for good. I’m borrowing a phrase from Bush on purpose. Who are the deciders? Some of those deciders are forces for good and some are forces for evil. I'm not even gonna get into it. Oy. I’ll do this in my closing remarks. I -- I would just repeat that the most important thing is the value that art-- art is a meritocracy. It is a meritocracy because the final arbiters of what is important are other artists. All the hype, all the spin, all the effort to construct a career out of thin air, all the efforts to manipulate the market notwithstanding, over the long haul if you don’t have the respect of other artists it will disappear and it will not stand the test of time. So if we’re looking at short term investment, perhaps it can be manipulated and perhaps it’s not always the most perfectly run organiza--opportunity. But over the long haul it’s left up to other artists. And I think that’s what finally determines the value in art."

    "data":"Thank you. I’m going to make some points to support what Richard’s already begun on our behalf. And these will be made more in the way that a drunk might use a lamppost -- in support rather than illumination. however, an early statement from 1932, pre-regulation of the stock market, which FDR managed, importantly, to begin over here, began with the remarks that it was needed because of shocking disclosures of low standards in high places. This possibly is something that could be applied to the art market, I fear. The stock market in London has a dictum. The dictum is: Meum dictum pactum. This means, My word is my bond. And it is one of the important maxims in the art world, but unfortunately, it is not one that necessarily is worth banking upon. I’m gonna illustrate three reasons why the motion: The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market, for me, holds water. The first is that there is no real regulation. The second, that there is no transparency in the market, and the third, that there are absolutely no barriers to entry. The first, no real regulation – let me explain by telling you a story against myself. In 1989 and 1990 – it’s a long time ago – I was in short trousers. I had a gallery in London already. I came to New York on the day of one of the big auctions. And I made a deal with an art dealer here in New York – somebody who is extremely prominent to this day – to buy eight paintings by the German painter, George Baselitz – an artist who I still greatly admire. And I agreed to buy these for 2.4 million dollars, which at the time seemed an extraordinary amount of money to me. I think I was twenty-four years old at the time. And I left the gallery of this man I’d made the deal with. And I waited because there was one similar painting that night in auction in New York. And the painting made eight hundred thousand dollars. I went to bed that night feeling very clever. The next morning I got a telephone call from the dealer, who told me that the deal did not stand and that he was gonna walk away from it. And of course I was outraged. But under the UCC regulations, anything that is not written on paper and is a transaction above five hundred dollars is not enforceable. Clearly here, ethics and the law were not working hand in hand. Ethically, I felt he was doing something that was appalling. Legally, he was absolutely right, he could do it. That illustrates my first point, that there is no real regulation. The second point that there is no transparency in the market has been touched upon by Richard, in his remarks about the auction houses and the creation of rings. Rings are… relatively simple to create, it needs a group of people who stand outside the framework of the auction houses, and they decide to promote an artist, it’s very easily done with a young artist, and I can think of one at the moment in the Middle East who is an interesting young painter whose work has rocketed in price, from tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars, in the space of less than two years. A group of people bought a lot of pictures, they each owned individually, group of pictures, and they started to put these pictures into auction, they then go to the auctions, they get groups of people bid them up, and thereby they feather their own nests. And…this draws attention of the press, the press attention to the artist, and it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy that this artist starts to go up in value, and by a process of osmosis, the ring benefit from the auction house activity that they’ve begun. This is not transparent to the outside viewer, but to art world professionals, it is quite obvious when this is happening. The last point, and possibly the most important point, is that, unlike the stock market…there are no barriers to entry. To become an art dealer, you need to have a pulse. You need to be able to count… and probably you need two eyes in your head. But beyond that anybody can be and call themselves an art dealer. There was an extraordinary scenario that took place here, predominantly here in New York, with an art dealer, so-called, called Michael Cohen, some of you may know about this but I’m going to use him as an example of an extraordinary situation, where he began to trade in commodities, and in the stock market, and ran into a lot of financial trouble. This was not his business, this was what he was making money doing on the side. But he realized that he could solve his problems, where there was an absolute call on his money at 30 days, and he had to deliver, by using other people’s paintings as collateral. Some of them, he parked even in the auction houses, his level of chutzpah has to be seen to be believed, he actually managed to sell a Titian that was on the wall of the Met. In any case, this gentleman eventually did become unseated. And he has disappeared, last sighted in Brazil. And if anybody can help us out with his whereabouts, Jerry Saltz, our resident investigative journalist would love to write a story all about it. I use him as an example, there are very clear demands placed upon people, who go into the stock market, the stock market is regulated, these individuals are fingerprinted, they are members of a licensed body of people who are allowed to trade. Their backgrounds are heavily investigated before they begin. This is not the case with the art world. And for these three reasons, there is no regulation, no transparency, and no barriers to entry. These are the reasons that I believe absolutely, that the motion, the art market is less ethical than the stock market, cannot be disputed."

    "data":"Thank you, John. Well, this is such a juicy topic, I really don’t even know where to begin, my notes feel, you know, my head is flooding with all sorts of other ideas besides these, that I’ve put before myself on these pieces of paper today. Certainly I’d like to just say that when you’re on a panel it’s much more interesting to sit on one than sit through one, so I will, you know, work very hard to play to type and make it lively and interesting and there’ve been many swipes against auction house people tonight and as I am the auction house person on this panel, I will get to sort of support and defend the position and place of the auction house as sort an ethical player, but… In reading the proposition over and over again, “The art market is less ethical than the stock market,” of course I had to read this multiple times and I had to analyze every word. Certainly colonizing the word “ethical” will help make you the winner tonight. And, something ethical is described as “proper conduct and good living.” An essential aspect of ethics is the concept of the life worth living, that each of us aspires to this quality of life and aspires to have the kind of life that allows us to sleep at night and lead an ethical, good life that makes it all worth living. A few things basically need to be established here. Art is not a pure commodity, it’s not an ordinary commodity. While it certainly is bought and sold and traded, the motivations for the place of art in our society, the motivations for its existence and everyone who plays within the game of the art world, are incredibly conflicting in fact. So…my premise depends on the concept that the art market does not exist without the art world. That in fact the art world adds hugely to the conscience of the art market. What do I mean by the art world, I mean the entire museum profession, critics, curators, conservators, other sorts of people in the cultural production business, writers, graphic designers who work with artists, etcetera. Art is valuable emotionally, intellectually, historically, in a way that other commodities are not inherently. The motivations for becoming part of the art world are too multiple and varied, the rewards are too varied among the various groups, an artist becomes part of the art world for a completely different set of reasons, than a dealer does, than a critic does. So while there is—in the art world there are too many different rewards, the reward structure is fractured and varied. Whereas in the stock market, presumably there is a singular reward which is financial compensation. Within that, there is not really an ability for ethical behavior to— it’s hard to get into ethical run-ins because everybody has a completely different system of reward and a completely different reason for existing within that. Part of what I put forth here is that art is a bit like physics, it can exist both as wave and as particle, so it is at once something that is bought, sold, traded as a commodity, or as something like a commodity, and it exists in this sort of higher place, of emotional, intellectual, historical, and cultural meaning and cultural relevance. I believe that there’s something that exists in the art world, that exists in the art market, that makes it completely different from the stock market, and that is something that I would call, pressure of a common pool, which is a sort of basic, Economics 101 theory, an idea that things that are precious in the public domain that no one exactly owns, let’s say like aquifers, groundwater, forests, fisheries, things of this kind, are in fact, there’s a kind of rule of conduct about how people engage within them which is essentially… more or less ethical. People who do not behave well within these common public treasures are in fact outliers or criminals and are really quickly rooted out, and that those of us who participate in this pressure of a common pool participate ethically and carefully. I believe works of art are something that give us tremendous pleasure. They really, you know, all the beautiful platitudes about feeding our soul and carrying us through difficult times, all of this is entirely true, particularly now, and that we all treat works of art in the same coveted fashion with care, respect, and preciousness that works of art deserve. If you break these rules of engagement you are a criminal or an outlier. People who know art, people who collect it, artists who make it, collectors who very much covet it, really know that they are only temporary custodians of works of art, it’s kind of like being a foster parent, you don’t really own these works of art, you just take care of them for a while because they’re supposed to outlive you. And you’re supposed to pass them on to someone else. So as long as that is the ethos that surrounds a work of art, how this object is understood in the world and in the marketplace will always be different than something that trades as pure commodity. So, with the position that the art market is less ethical than the stock market, the art world is by far more ethical than the stock market. It has a conflicting set of—has a very varied and various, numerous reward system among its various participants, as opposed to the singularity of money that comes from the stock market. And the actual object traded is very different than a share of stock in all of its principles. properties, ideas, and values. And that is why I am arguing against this proposition tonight. Thank you."

And May 12th, “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” and it is, so, that gives you a hint of where I stand here, I’m here to basically argue the point that the art market is less ethical than the stock market, which it is. I want to start off by reminding you all what “ethical” actually means, ‘cause I wasn’t even sure what it meant when I thought about it. “Ethical” means “being in accordance with the rules or standards for right conduct,” ethics means this is correct and right conduct and practice. The standards of a profession, and this is the standards of the profession of the art dealer we’re talking about. An example here is, it was not considered ethical for physicians to advertise. It is not ethical for physicians to advertise, I thought well why can’t physicians advertise if they’re good. And the reason is physicians are there to help people. Physicians are supposed to help you with your health. And therefore it’s not really a business. Just like the art market is not really a business but then how can it be a market and not be a business? We get into this whole…ethical question, about art and the market, these two things are really at loggerheads in a way. And I thought, do art dealers advertise. Because it would not be appropriate for physicians to advertise. Do art dealers advertise, and I thought, every art dealer I know, advertised heavily. As a matter of fact, auction houses advertise, everyone advertises, and therefore, it immediately made me feel well perhaps, advertising is a sign that this is a business and not simply about…ethics and proper conduct. Now, in terms of the stock market, the SEC regulates public companies. And the reason for that, is really to protect the public. If it weren’t for protecting the public, in fact the government would let everyone do whatever they wanted to do with public companies, private companies and whatnot. We have many, many rules and regulations for the financial markets and of course more rules to break, is what many people will think, or more rules to skirt. But the reality is that those rules are there. Now on the other hand, we have works of art, which are inherently unique. Each work of art is quite different. Even if there is a Degas which sold today for $19 million, that Degas is one of I believe 20 that he made and that particular Degas was cast after his death, that’s what we call a posthumous cast, so, in my view that Degas is quite different from a cast that Degas made during his lifetime. How could we regulate Degas’s Danseuse, even if two were exactly the same. The skirt is going to be slightly different, the patina was slightly different. One of them got dropped on the floor and restored, the other one didn’t. So therefore, since art is inherently, each work of art is inherently unique, it’s extremely difficult to regulate. So I was trying to imagine how we would regulate the art world in order to make it truly ethical. And I was thinking we would have to create something called the AEC, as opposed to the SEC we would have the AEC which is the Art Exchange Commission. This would be a counterpart to the SEC, perhaps a subdivision, in which case we could go after Madoff and we could also go after art dealers who have sold things that are not correct. I think that that whole idea of regulating the art world is in and of itself impossible. And so then I thought, well, what are these standards for proper conduct. How can we be proper, how can we be ethical, in the art market. And I quickly thought of six fast reasons which make it difficult to ensure that every trade in the art market will be ethical. The…of course, many of the dealers and many of the people at the auction houses and many of the artists are my dear friends, and I don’t mean to say that any of them are unethical. My point is rather that the art market itself is ripe for unethical behavior. That doesn’t mean that the participants in it are unethical. My personal feeling is that the people in the art world that I know are the most wonderful and ethical people I know in any environment, in any business. But that being said, the entire market is ripe for anything to happen. For example. Stocks, when stocks trade, you pay a commission. You can pay between one and 15 cents, you like the guy, you pay 15 cents, he’s given you good information, you can pay 50 cents, you can give him a dollar. You can trade with Charles Schwab. You—it’s a penny a share. When you’re buying a work of art, you have no idea what that real commission is. The art market is all fair game, it’s caveat emptor. Unless you’re going in with a dealer that you know, or a work of art that you know or you have a consultant who you trust, you have no idea what the commission is. You don’t know if it’s 10 percent, 15 percent, yes, common practice is 10 percent. Common practice in the art world, 10 percent commission. My question to you is, 10 percent of what. The next point which I think is pretty much going to blow this up, is the insider trading. Now, you know that insider trading is wrong when you’re trading public securities. Matter of fact insider training is wrong when you’re trading bonds, when you’re trading stocks. Now, you know, it’s illegal on Wall Street and the reality is in the art market, we live on inside information. I mean the whole art market is based on inside information, I mean that’s the whole idea of art. You know, there are the insiders and then there are the outsiders. Yes, there’s the concept that art is for everyone and art will transcend, and we all want that feeling, I mean, certainly we want the art that’s going to speak to everyone. However, the reality is, when you’re actually buying art, when you’re a collector, when you’re reaching into your pocket and you need to spend money, you want to know everything, at least I do. It’s not only about love, of course I love, but, I can’t buy everything in the world. So I need to choose what I’m gonna do with my resources and I wanna have all that information, especially the inside information that I know that dealer has. Another type of inside information would be if a young artist is going to a big gallery. This is a critical thing to know. The other thing is opportunities for currency exchanges. Geographic. A painting in one country is worth less than a painting in another country. Does that make dealers unethical? Absolutely not. But the whole system is ripe for anything to happen, and that’s the beauty of art, and the art market."

    "data":"Thank you. Thank you. First I wanna say, art is not optional. It’s always been here, since the beginning, it has never gone away, it’s not going away. Okay? It isn’t just a decorative hedge that grows in front of a market, or in front of industry  or philosophy. Art is a necessity, okay? It changes the world, it won’t reduce the incidence of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa but it does change the world incrementally, and/or by osmosis, okay? So when you keep talking about the market I want to say to my friends on the other side…that almost there’s a self-hating thing to your argument to me. Because, you are representatives of the market. And I have to remind you first of all, 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of artists actually make money. And even they barely do and usually only for a very short time. So while—and look at, their clothes are pretty good. And I’m not against--Mr. Feigen just sold a painting for $12 million, that’s great, yesterday, and I think you deserve that. There’s nothing wrong with that. But when we’re standing here talking about secrecy and manipulation instead of sorcery or prestidigitation or you’re talking about, you’re upset because we’re not regulated. I don’t want us ever to be regulated. This is the art world…people. Am I yelling? This—If this were the industry, that side would be right. But this is the art world, and a world is a place that has a vision, that has problems. The market is a place obviously that people exhibit junkie-like behavior. Millionaires try to enter art history by spending a lot of money. Sometimes the market’s like a friendly Labrador that kind of slobbers all over you and it’s very annoying, but you can’t somehow ignore it. I’m not denying, that the market is a combination of hundreds of things, be it greed, luck, research, a great eye, and I do know one great art dealer in Germany, Johann Koenig, with only one eye, and he can only see about 10 percent with that eye, and he is one of the best dealers in the world. Did I just argue against our side? This is the art world. It isn’t the art industry. They are appealing—and I like them, you know, I see them everywhere—to the cynical side of your nature. I’m being honest with you. The part that goes yeah, it’s all a dirty deal. And everybody’s bad, but let me tell you something. Everybody isn’t bad, most people, and certainly…they’re not, but that’s a different— Art dealers, a lot of them are missing the same chromosome. You know? And it’s very annoying, but I—they create worlds…and they pay the bills, they deal with artists, they deal with critics, they deal with collectors. They deal with plumbers, they do a lot. And if they don’t sell 10 shows in a row, they will close. There shouldn’t be regulation, there shouldn’t— And you complain because anyone can enter? I’m gonna be honest, I have no degrees at all. I am so lucky to be here, and I think about it all day every day. That I’m—you know how I got in the art world, I went like this. I’m in the art world. And they said, what are you, and I went, uh…I’ll be a critic. And that’s how I did what I’m doing. We all are making this up out of ourselves, just like you. To be perfectly honest, we’re all learning on the job. Everybody’s learning on the job, all the time, rules, you want to start the AEC, no, no, no. I mean no offense, I love these people but I hate these ideas. Sorry. We’re not talking about ethics, the art world is ethical, it’s not ethical, it’s this, it’s that, it doesn’t compare, it’s not a $15 billion bubble anywhere, for God’s sake, it’s not nuclear, secrets that are being leaked. Yes, these guys do know how the secrets are done, and I love that they do, and I don’t even hate them for it, I think, fine, that’s part of it, that’s part of their game. But we’re not talking about ethics, we’re talking about—aesthetics. Aesthetics is the type of thinking and judgment that we use in the art world, and yes. Damien Hirst’s skull cost $100 million, it was very publicly, that he was one of the owners of it. Fine. Whatever. But there’s also the lifestyles of the poor and famous. Vito Acconci right now is standing around going, uh, I still have no money. You know. Adrian Piper, I’m naming names you might not know. The point I guess I’m trying to make, is the art world will work the way it works, it’s time to rethink it. This is true. Because, a lot of the ideas they’re talking about, and I don’t say this about them, but seem very, very yesterday. And a time long, long ago, and we were very lucky to have this very temporary bubble, where 1 percent of blah-blah-blah made money and that’s great. I want more artists to make more money, so they don’t have to have dark nights of the soul at their jobs for 40 hours. Now they are. And so are you, and so are they, we’re gonna have to worry a little bit more. But…I think you just have to let the art world be what it is. The rethinking of it has to be look at the huge white cubes that we now have. Look, that they may not be enhancing the journeys to art, but may have become content in themselves. The same way that the talk about the market, hollows out art. It takes your eyes off the prize, the way Amy and Chuck were talking about, and you’re stuck talking about a red herring, something that to be perfectly honest, not one person this room, not them… got into the art world to do. Each one of them is here because they love art. So, peace and love."

    "data":"We need to abolish the minimum wage. And there's only one argument that matters on this issue, and it's the moral argument. Does the minimum wage make the world a better place? And does it improve or hurt the lives of the poorest American families and the workers who are in those families? Now, those Americans with the least education and the lowest skill levels have struggled tremendously over the last three decades. They find themselves in competition with machines, computers, automation, with foreign workers. Their job opportunities have shrunk. Their standard of living is mediocre at best, but the minimum wage is the wrong way to help those people. It attacks the effects of economic change rather than doing anything about the underlying causes. And by doing so, it hurts the people that we're trying to help. You don't need a special theory of the labor market or a degree in economics to understand that making workers artificially more expensive makes it harder for them to find work. Now, those who support the minimum wage will tell you it's necessary to create a level playing field between employers and employees, that workers need the bargaining power that they are -- that they're missing, and the minimum wage makes that up. But in reality, most of us don't need that extra help. 95 percent of workers who are paid the hourly wage, which is about 75 million Americans -- 95 percent of those make more than the minimum wage already. And that includes my cleaning lady, who I pay over two times the minimum wage. Now, why do I do that? Because I'm an incredibly nice person. Well, that's what I like to think. But I really know better, because I'm an economist. The reason I play my cleaning lady almost $20 an hour is because if I don't, she doesn't show up. She has other alternatives that she will turn to if I don't meet her market wage. It is those alternatives that protect her from the greed of employers. And alternatives force employers to treat employees well and most of us don't need legislation to protect us in the labor force. But the minimum wage does boost the salary of about 3.5 million Americans. About half of those, 1.7 million, are young people, 16 to 24. They get helped by the minimum wage as do those who make a little more than that, because it boosts the attractiveness of those workers relative to what it would otherwise be without the minimum wage. But those artificially high wages, that boost in wage discourages employers from hiring other workers who are low-skilled and have little experience. This is particularly tragic today, when the unemployment rate among 16-to 24-year-olds is 16 percent. And for African Americans -- young African Americans, it's over 29 percent. Almost one in three. Now, many who support the minimum wage will argue that somehow you could raise wages artificially and there'll be no net effect on employment. But who believes that employers don't respond to incentives to higher wages and try to find ways to save costs? That's why employers replace workers with machines. That's why they send factories overseas. And that's why manufacturing employment has been falling steadily in recent decades, not just as a proportion of the total, but in absolute numbers, because fewer and fewer low-skilled workers who used to do those jobs are needed to produce the goods that we still make and manufacture. And by the way, the U.S. manufacturing sector, in output terms, is thriving. But in employment terms, it's struggling. And those are the places that people without a college degree used to find a good job. Those opportunities are shrinking. Why would artificially increasing the wages of workers, especially those who don't go to college and who don't finish high school -- why would artificially increasing those wages make those workers better off? Why would it have no effect on their employment? Consider my favorite exemption to the minimum wage: the internship. The internship is a very special kind of violation of the minimum wage. You pay zero. You're allowed to pay zero. You're allowed to pay less than the minimum wage as long as it's zero. How strange is that? But we all understand that, for our kids, that's a glorious thing. It's what's needed because their skills aren't often worth $7.25 an hour, and we want them to get that experience at the bottom of their -- at the beginning, at the bottom of the economic scene, so they can get the experience, and the mentoring, and all the things that come with being in the workplace. And thank goodness that there is a special exemption for zero. Does anybody think that if we got rid of that, there'd be more opportunities for young people? Others justify the minimum wage by saying the effects are small -- the employment effects. Small? When you lose your job or can't find one, the effect isn't small, it's 100 percent. So it's nice to give 1.7 million young workers a raise, but what about the 3.4 million unemployed workers 16-to-24, last month, who can't find work? We're increasing the wages of 1.7 million and making it harder for 3.4 million to find work, twice as many. I don't accept that tradeoff. That's a tragedy. I reject it. It's a bad bargain. The irony of the minimum wage is that it reduces the bargaining power of the people at the bottom end. It reduces the number of opportunities they have while increasing the number of people who are trying to find them. The best argument for the minimum wage is that our school system is a failure, so we have to do something to help those at the bottom. But this is the wrong way to fix it. It's an additional barrier to the least skilled workers of America, making it harder for them to find work, those who have the least education, the least ability, the fewest connections, the ones who desperately need that first job to start their career. I beg you to consider that the best intentions don't always lead to good results. Abolish the minimum wage. Let young people and the least skilled have a better chance of getting the experience they need to thrive and prosper. Thank you very much. "

    "data":"Well, I'm glad to see all of you here and that you've chosen this over other D.C. options you had tonight. You could be looking at the cherry blossoms or seeing the Nationals play, but you've come to talk and debate the minimum wage, so you're my kind of people. So I'm glad you're here. Here is my main point. Luckily, for our side, strongly against abolishing the minimum wage, almost everything you just heard from Russ is shown to be false by a large body of compelling research. So let me start with my main point. Abolishing the minimum wage would be a terrible policy mistake that would needlessly hurt millions of low wage workers. It's not a policy, this idea of abolishing the minimum wage. This policy is nowhere near the current agenda. In fact, as you've heard, the current debate asks whether the minimum wage should be increased. Now, it is true that during the Republican primary, Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain endorsed the idea in the Republican primary of abolishing the minimum wage, but that idea of abolishing a policy that's been in place since the 1930s, helping low wage workers, is about as far out of the mainstream as you can get, and let me explain why. Now, this gray hair I have, I got through a lifetime, as was mentioned earlier, of analyzing social and economic policies, beginning as a social worker in New York City with the poor, and I worked my way -- I don't want to say up, sideways, wherever it is I am now -- to whatever it is I'm doing today. And, you know, over those decades, I focused on two things, what's gone wrong in our economy and which policies could help give less advantaged folks a shot, a fair chance? It's through that simple agenda that decades ago I became interested in minimum wage policy. As globalization, and technological change, and a lot of other stuff that we can talk about throughout the evening have evolved, economic growth no longer reaches working families the way it used to. And the further you go down the pay scale, the less growth you're likely to see. The minimum wage partially helps offset that problem. And, in fact, you will be hard pressed to find a policy that does what it sets out to do, raising the pay of low wage workers, more effectively or more efficiently. And importantly, and this is why I stressed it when I started, and we'll have lots of time to get into this, I hope, reams of high quality research shows that it does so with the minimum of the type of side effects that you heard Russ emphasize. Consider this, just start here with a little commonsense thought experiment. The American minimum wage, as you've heard, has been in place since 1938, 75 years ago. It has been raised 22 times. Nineteen states now have their own minimum wages above the federal level. If this policy was so damaging, as damaging as Russ claims, that it needs to be abolished, how could it be that citizens and legislatures in 19 states decided not to abolish it, but to raise it above the federal level? If it was anywhere near as damaging as our opponents claim, how could the minimum wage not only have survived this long, but have flourished and expanded? The answer, once again, is because it's widely understood and accepted by mainstream economics, policymakers, and perhaps most importantly, low-wage workers themselves, who overwhelmingly support the policy -- that's very important, I'll come back to that -- as doing what it's supposed to do, steering a bit more of the economic growth their way. Now, to do what our opponents advocate, to get rid of the minimum wage, would figuratively take the wage floor out from under millions of low-wage workers, many of whom -- and Karen will emphasize these points -- depend on the minimum wage to support their families. It's very misleading to say that this is just a teenagers’ issue. It's not. For these reasons, as you've heard, the president has proposed an increase in the federal -- in the federal minimum wage. Now, that's what we ought to actually be debating. I firmly believe that economists can and should have good, robust debates about that kind of a proposal -- should the minimum wage be increased or not? But that's not what we're arguing about. That's not what you're voting on on the resolution. Our opponents think that America should have no minimum wage at all. To me, a better question than that -- than the one on notice tonight, should be -- should the minimum wage be abolished? The better question is why anyone would even suggest such a bad idea? So, why would you -- why would you even think that? And I think the answer comes down to two factors. First, common misconceptions, ones that should have been banished by the research. And second, because of a laissez-faire market ideology that trumps common sense and empirical evidence. Now, a word about this evidence. There's probably no question that's been analyzed more carefully by economists than this one, about the impact of the minimum wage on low-wage workers. And the conclusion is that it raises the pay of low-wage workers without hurting their jobs prospects. Of literally thousands of estimates on the impact of the minimum wage on job impacts of affected workers, the vast majority find that the benefits to low-wage workers -- the benefits to low-wage workers -- exactly the opposite of what's -- of what Russell claims -- the benefits for low-wage workers far outweigh any costs in terms of reduced hours or job loss. Now, recall that I mentioned all of these states with their own minimum wage levels exist. That's provided something that minimum wage researchers have found very rare in economics -- pseudo-experimentation. The best way to test the impact of an intervention like this is to compare places that are as like -- as -- in terms of economic variables as you can find. Yet, one has the economic intervention and the other doesn't. These studies, this pseudo-experimentation, comparing states and places across borders, have consistently found results, job loss effects, that hover around zero. Sometimes a little bit below. I will grant the other side that. Sometimes slightly negative, sometimes slightly positive, but hover around zero. So we have here a simple policy that for 75 years, has been doing what it's designed to do with little fanfare and minimal, if any, negative side effects. Abolishing it makes absolutely no sense at all. Thank you. "

    "data":"Good evening. It's a pleasure to be here. I hope you will keep an open mind and vote for abolishing the minimum wage. Jared gave some evidence -- there was just a new study out by David Neumark, written for the NBER, National Bureau of Economic Research, one of the foremost research organizations in the United States, with top scholars. He refutes much of what Jared just said. Actually, the preponderance of evidence is in favor of the fact that the minimum wage does destroy jobs. Why? Because if anybody believes in the law of demand, it means when prices go up, there's less of it that people buy. And nobody's ever disproven the law of demand, not even Jared. Nobody in Congress has disproven the law of demand. So, I think we should keep that in mind. Hong Kong never had a minimum wage. I've been over -- I've been visiting China since 1988, every year, just about. Hong Kong started to develop in trade in 1938 and it was just a bunch of shanties and everything. Hong Kong rose up to be one of the most prosperous places in the world without a minimum wage. So the minimum wage is neither necessary nor sufficient for prosperity; what prosperity requires is opportunities. The minimum wage destroys opportunities. I had a friend of mine, his mother was working at a department store up in New Hampshire. After the kids grew up, she was making close to the minimum wage. The minimum wage went up, she lost her job. She enjoyed this job; it changed her whole life. And she was denied the opportunity to go back and offer her labor services at the pre-minimum wage; that is, the wage that she was agreeing to work at freely. The minimum wage interferes with individual freedom and economic freedom. And that's what's wrong with the minimum wage to a large extent. It reduces -- it reduces -- it doesn't increase workers' bargaining power because it makes it illegal for the worker to offer her labor services for less than the minimum even though she's willing to do so because that's a better opportunity for her. And it makes it illegal for the employer to hire that worker. Also, it should be obvious that if you increase the wage rate above the going market wage rate, if it's only a little bit above, it's not going to have much of an effect. But if it's quite a bit above, as happened in New York State in the early 2000s, then it led to a about 20 percent decrease in the unemployment rate in New York State for teenage workers aged about 16 to 24 without a high school diploma. They kind of cut off the bottom rung for the ladder. They couldn't get in the market. There was a surplus. There's lots of jobs when the wage rate is lower; when if goes higher, there's fewer jobs. But many workers want to get those jobs at the minimum wage. The government promises people a minimum wage, but the politicians can't keep that promise because there's two sides to the market. The employers will not hire as many workers when the wage rate goes up. And in the short run, there may not be much unemployment. But in the longer run, as Russ pointed out, the employers will substitute skilled workers for unskilled workers. They might use a computer and have one worker rather than ten, or they may substitute labor-saving devices. And there's lots of evidence to show this. Just an article in the Wall Street Journal over the weekend, woman was running -- she runs bakeries, cupcake bakeries. She hires -- she has about ten young workers working for her. She said because of the anticipated increase in the minimum wage and the indexation, that she's going to replace those ten workers with some tablets and a skilled worker to run the operation so that they can order using the tablets. Another person that owns some restaurants and so forth, he's going to go to use his new app called Squared, which basically makes it easier to clear checks and process credit cards. And he will displace about 30 out of his 75 workers, he said in that interview. So this is a reality. The woman that lost her job in New Hampshire, that's not just a statistic, that's a personal story. We can play games with statistics. And there's a preponderance of evidence, as I said, that the minimum wage has these detrimental effects. In fact, Neumark in his study, after looking at all these other studies, said his conclusion has not changed. And it's a very, very rigorous study. What else happens? Employers use temporary workers rather than full-time workers. They might make one worker do the job of four because after all, there's a surplus of labor now. There's unemployed workers that are looking for these jobs so they can just, you know, lay somebody off and make the other workers work that much harder. It also destroys jobs, jobs that used to be done in the United States. When I was a kid, they had elevator operators in Buffalo, New York. You won't see those anymore. You might see them in Argentina. They don't have baggers at the grocery stores. Those have become full-time jobs, in many cases, unionized. And it slows job growth. There was just a new study out by Texas A&M showing that the minimum wage has slowed job growth, which we should expect. How do you explain these huge unemployment rates among black male teenagers that are, you know, over 30 percent? In Spain, they have a very rigid minimum wage. And the unemployment rate there is 26 percent, the national rate. The unemployment rate among younger workers -- unskilled workers who are typically younger workers, is double that. How do you explain that? The minimum wage, also, by the way, does not reduce the poverty rate. Poverty rate has actually increased a little bit because of the minimum wage. Doug Adie and other people have looked at that; Neumark as well. And if you can't get a job -- because, remember, the law -- what does it do? It increases the wage rate, but if you don't get a job, your income is zero. That's what a lot of people don't understand. The difference between the wage rate, which is the price, and income, which is the price of labor times the hours worked. If you can't get a job, your income's zero. So we found that the people that this affects are low skilled workers in low income families, and that's why the poverty rate is affected. "

    "data":"Thank you, John. I want to return to the moral question that we started with because the moral question is all on our side. Let's talk about what would happen to real people in real families if the U.S. were to go down this untested and quite radical path of eliminating the minimum wage as our opponents urge. What I want you to understand is that roughly one quarter of all children in the United States, more than 17 million children, have a parent earning the minimum wage or just above. Another way to think about this, only -- almost one of three of those who benefit from the minimum wage, so they're just at the minimum wage or they're just above it, and so they're what we think that their wages are bumped up because of the minimum wage, are parents. One in three. That means that today, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage because of the low level of our minimum wage is still living below the poverty line at today's level of the minimum wage. These families, as Jared and I have actually studied, work more and more hours and yet still have to make terrible choices every day. They have to choose, Do I pay for childcare or leave my little child alone? Can I afford healthcare? Can I afford to put anything aside in case I lose a job? What our opponents are asking is to get rid of the minimum wage that keeps those families barely afloat today. How can they even consider that? I want to think beyond that family and what the implications of pulling out the rug under them would mean for the rest of us. First of all, let's think about the knowledge economy. Our opponents have been talking about teens and letting them work for less money, but we're talking about a knowledge economy where we want to compete for high-wage jobs, and the people who are going to take those -- the children growing up in those families are the ones who are going to be the human capital of our society going forward. They're going to pay your and my Social Security. They're growing up in those families, earning those very low wages. They'd be worse off. There would be less to invest in those children. Social mobility in the U.S. -- the U.S. used to be the home where, if you were brought -- born into a poor family, you could make good. That's less and less true. The American dream is under more and more threat. We're behind every country -- this is OECD data. We're behind every country except the U.K. now in terms of social mobility. We're behind France in social mobility. So do we really want to go backwards, get further away from the American dream? No, I don't think so. I think we want to restore the American dream, not turn this country into a Dickensian nightmare. Inequality, closely related to social mobility -- inequality is approaching record levels. And we think that half of the increase in inequality is a result of the falling minimum wage, half of the increase in inequality for those at the lower end. Then there's the issue of our economic recovery -- our fragile economic recovery. If the minimum wage -- if abolishing the minimum wage had any effect at all, it would surely take money out of the economy. In fact, it would act as a reverse stimulus. So let's think very carefully before we go down this road as a society. I'd like to bring up women, as the only woman on this panel. Over half of those who earn the minimum wage are women, and these women obviously already face disadvantages. If you look at the data, women are poorer than men at every age, and in old age the gap is tremendous because of the low wages that they earn. If we eliminate the minimum wage, this will especially hurt women. Now, can we afford the minimum wage? It's a big question. Yes, absolutely we can afford the minimum wage. As Jared said, we've had it for over 75 years, hasn't hurt overall economic growth. The wealthiest Americans are doing extremely well. Corporate profitability is growing; as we know, the stock market just broke new records. But the families at the bottom end are not sharing in this increasing economic growth. We can afford to let them share a little bit of that.  There's no evidence that the minimum wage costs jobs. There was a famous study two decades ago by Alan Krueger, now the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Berkeley's David Card. They studied New Jersey's fast food restaurants and they found a slight increase in employment as a result of the minimum wage being raised. And countless economists have poured in to try to refute this and they haven't been able to. They've done all kinds of studies. And as Jared said, there's just no evidence that employment is hurt. And this applies to studies not just carried out in the U.S., but those in the United Kingdom, Australia, and other countries.  We heard about Hong Kong. Let's talk about Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a city-state of 7 million people, smaller than New York City, where I grew up. I don't think we want to gamble the United States' economic future on an experiment in Hong Kong. In China, however -- Thanks. In China, however, the provinces actually have something like a minimum wage. It's a monthly floor. But in Beijing, they actually have a minimum wage, and guess what? The central government in China just decided to raise that wage across the country so that it will be 40 percent of the average salary, which is higher than we have -- what we're talking about that we have right now. I just -- I just want you to think about the maid who makes your bed in the hotel when you're out of town, the person who serves you that salad when you go to the fast food restaurant at lunchtime. Most of these people do not earn enough today to feed themselves, house their kids, and take care of their families. We -- they cannot afford to see their incomes fall. The moral argument is absolutely on our side, to not pull the rug out of low-income families. Please vote no on abolishing the minimum wage. Thank you. "

    "data":"So just to start, I have to tell you I went to Oxford for a year, and my mother, of course, I was a New Yorker, she said, How come you still talk like a New Yorker? So it didn't work. But I never actually went to Oxford Union debates. And this is actually styled after it. I wish I had. So what I'd like to do first is just to talk about the way that we're going to branch out in terms of my teammate and I. I'm going to focus first on the domestic economy. And actually because of what I do for a living, both in terms of the research I've done and the fact that I was a policy maker at the Federal Reserve, and my teammate John Taylor is going to focus on the international ramifications of a strong dollar policy. So let me actually go out and make two points. And the first point is that when we think about what is good policy, I'm going to say what is a good policy for the American economy. And in particular, the first thing we have to do is ask where are we right now? And two things that I want to talk about is where are we in terms of our business cycle, where are we in terms of unemployment? Not very good. We have unemployment rate of 7.7 percent. People are out there struggling. And furthermore, we're in a situation where we also have inflation which is actually too low, so inflation right now is actually running in the preferred measure, 1.2 percent, which is below their target level. So in fact we're in a situation where we're not doing as well as we'd like on either component of what we think s important in terms of stabilizing the economy. Furthermore, the economy is not growing that fast. It's been growing very, very slowly, hasn't really picked up yet. So we're in a situation with a weak economy and actually inflation, which is on the low side. So now let's ask what would a strong dollar do? Well, a strong dollar would actually mean that the currency would go up in value; that would make American goods and services more expensive; if they're more expensive people will buy less of them; that foreigners are not going to buy our goods and services the way they did before. What will that do? That will actually end up lowering the demand for our goods and services; as a result, our economy would actually weaken further. Is that what we want? Absolutely not right now, because we'd actually get an  economy with higher unemployment and actually inflation, which would be even lower, which has been trending down, it'll go actually down lower. So it's not the right policy at this particular point in time. And so, in that sense, I think that it's a very bad policy to think that what we need to do right now is to strengthen the dollar. So that's point one. Point two is a little bit more subtle and I'm going to be a little more academic here, that I'm actually going to argue that it's a mistake to have any dollar policy, whether a strong one or a weak one. Why? Because what policy should focus on is stabilizing the economy; we should use our tools, both in terms of monetary policy and also fiscal policy, to actually stabilize the economy. At the current juncture we're in a situation where inflation is on the low side, we're actually in a situation where unemployment is on the high side, so in this case, actually, we would think that we don't want to have a strong dollar. In fact, if our policies are expansionary, they might actually produce a weaker dollar; however, there are other circumstances where, in fact, a strong -- having tight policy would be the right thing to do. In particular, we raise interest rates rather than keep them low. And that would be a situation where we have a lot of inflation. And we've been in periods where, in fact, we've had high inflation, very worried about it, and in that situation we would want to have tighter policy, either higher interest rates for monetary policy or tighter fiscal policy. That would also result in a stronger dollar, then that would be okay, that would work in the right direction. A stronger dollar would weaken the economy, actually help lower inflation, and indeed in periods where we actually had to go out and control inflation we actually needed to go to policies that result in a strong dollar. The point here is that in a situation where you focus on the dollar, you may very well get it wrong because that's not the ultimate objective for policy makers. The ultimate objective for policy makers should be to have a very strong economy. So I'm going to end a little early, I'm told I get a little [unintelligible] points for ending a little early. But I made those two points and clearly there'll be a lot of other discussion on these issues, maybe even the gold standard, which would be fun. I have bad news for you, Steve, your wish is not going to be fulfilled. I'm not a big fan of the gold standard. I'm sure we'll discuss that later. But with that, why don't I leave it to the other side? "

    "data":"What a strange proposition we are wrangling over this evening, ladies and gentlemen, a strong dollar, a not so strong dollar. The dollar is a unit of measurement. It measures the price of everything and anything. It preserves us from barter. It stores the value of work. The sine qua non of any unit of measurement is that it be fixed exacting, unwavering, true. My teammate and I, Steve Forbes favor a stable dollar so we oppose the motion in the same spirit we support the 12 inch foot, the well calibrated bathroom scale, and the more than 16 ounce serving of Mountain Dew. Now among the enumerated powers of congress is that to coin money and to regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin, and fix the standard weights and measures. The constitutional dollar was no placing of our monetary mandarins; it was a standard like the mile. Through most of the nation’s history, a dollar was defined under law as a particular weight of gold and silver, more often of gold, specifically of 23.22 grains fine. A little more than $20 was convertible on request into an ounce of gold, by and by the dollar was redefined. In the mid 1930s it was cheapened to 1/35th of an ounce of gold but still, still it was defined, anchored as something. Then came the fateful evening of August 15th, 1971, pre-empting the beloved popular horse opera, Bonanza, President Nixon announced that henceforth, the dollar would have no definition, no anchor. No longer would America’s creditors have the option of converting 35 George Washingtons into an ounce of bullion, that universal monetary medium that nobody can print. Henceforth said Nixon, lashing out against unnamed speculators, they always do, the dollar would be as good as paper. And that at least, is one political promise that Washington D.C. has faithfully kept. And what has this soft, undependable malleable post-1971 pure paper dollar wrought? Well in 1971, the gross public debt totaled 408 billion, or 38 percent of GDP. As of yesterday, the gross public debt totaled16.7 trillion, or more than 100 percent of projected 2013 GDP. Now think of the long-grade line of plans and resolutions to bring our national finances under control. The institution of the Congressional Budget Office. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, the emergency deficit control act, Reaffirmation Act of 1987, and on and on, and now comes Paul Ryan. Will he be our messiah? Well maybe, but I doubt it. As long as the treasury can borrow at 2 percent and as long as the Federal Reserve can conjure hundreds of billions of what they are pleased to call dollars, with which to buy up these emissions of debt, the red ink will continue to spill. Alexander Hamilton himself might have succumbed to the temptation. Anyway, in 1971, the final year in which the dollar was anchored by something, anything, foreign governments held U.S. government securities on the order of $31 billion. $31 billion. These holdings today top $3.3 trillion. They are the spore of our non-stock deficit on dirt goods and services. Consuming more than we produce, Americans remit dollars by the boatloads to our Asian creditors who obligingly return them by return mail in the shape of American investments in American IOUs. It’s as if the dollars never left the 50 states. Sweet it has been this privilege of America, the privilege of paying its foreign creditors in the currency that only it may lawfully print. But the unprivileged are fighting back. They too are cheapening their currencies through the modern techniques of ultra-low interest rates and that cut glass phrase, quantitative easing. You know, some years ago, the Financial Times published a letter to the editor concerning quantitative easing, that is to say in laymen’s language, central bank’s conjuring of new paper money secured by nothing except the good faith of the government that prints it. I finally think I understand the meaning of quantitative easing this correspondent wrote. What I no longer understand is the meaning of the word money. Under the rules of the true blue gold standard, governments tended to balance their budgets and international debtors and creditors tended in a timely fashion to square up accounts. I don’t have to tell you that no such constraints bind us today. Deficits grow and imbalances pile higher and higher, as you would expect them to, in a monetary sense. After all, we are playing tennis without a net. And for that matter, without baselines or sidelines and with imaginary green balls. Incongruous this is as well, volatile currencies, due to their mis-shift in a world increasingly and finely calibrated, the international system of units binds every commercial nation in a rigorous regime of weights and measures. And a good thing too, as 21st century engineering projects involve myriad interrelated elements which all must be measured alike, sometimes to an accuracy of up to one part in a million or more, as Robert Crease relates in his book, World in the Balance. Well, well, it's an ill wind that blows no one any good. Unanchored exchange rates have created a cottage industry and monetary volatility. John Taylor. John Taylor, from whom you'll hear in a moment has built a thriving foreign exchange trading business on the ashes of the good as gold dollar. Well, just look at the quality of that man's suit.  It's a fabulous business. The more the currencies dance and swerve, the better it is for Mr. Taylor and his hedge fund. To him, as to others in the forex trades, the very idea of monetary stability is -- it's worse than anathema. It's unprofitable. I would no more expect him to espouse a system of stable currencies and fixed exchange rates than I would an oncologist to welcome a cure for cancer. Our post-1971 helter-skelter monetary system also favors the prodigious talents of John's sparring partner and my sparring partner, his partner, Rick Mishkin. The holder of a Ph.D. in economics from MIT, a prolific author, and coach at [unintelligible], Fred ought to be at NASA. He should, if for not his sake, for our sake. And so should every holder of a Ph.D. in the Federal Reserve Board. Ladies and gentlemen, we've alighted from the gold standard over a course of decades into something that we should all regret, the Ph.D. standard.  "

    "data":"My cottage business happens to be dealing with the world and the reality in the world, not like Jim's which is dealing with the world the way he would like it to be. I would start out by saying that, Jim, your first statement to Rick was that you would be cutting the number of employees at the Fed. I would say that if we follow any of your policies, we'd be cutting the number of employees everywhere. And, unfortunately, unfortunately, yes, the dollar is as good as paper, and every currency in the world is as good as paper. We're not worse. We're not better. But the fact of the matter is, is that your dollar that's as good as paper is convertible into anything. You don't have to hold those dollars. I give another speech trying to sell our cash management program where I tell people -- I hold up a Zimbabwean hundred trillion dollar note that's worth about 20 cents and tell people that You shouldn't just keep your money in the United States, you should put your money around the world. You should be free. But the fact of the matter is, is that almost everybody wants to keep their money in the United States. Why can the Treasury borrow at 2 percent? They're not forcing you to lend them at 2 percent. They're not forcing the Bank of England to invest its money at 2 percent. They're not enforcing the Chinese to invest their money at 2 percent. But they do. And, therefore, the dollar has a value. Paper or not, it's got a value. And gold is not necessary. Also today everybody has the pleasure of borrowing with their own currency unless, of course, your currency is Zimbabwe and nobody wants to hold that. By the way, the latest figure I saw was that the National Bank of Zimbabwe had $210 in its account. That's the central bank. I don't know. The value's probably changed in the last week or two. But because everyone has the privilege of borrowing in their own currency, and that means Brazil, all kinds of emerging countries, we're no longer on this standard where the U.S. has a -- you know, there's power over the world, we borrow in our own currency, and everybody else is stuck. They have to, you know, balance their budget, do all the right things. No, unfortunately, in a way, from Jim's point of view, and I'm sure Steve's, as we'll hear, everybody has this ability to borrow too much. I don't think it's a good idea, I don't think it's necessarily going to end well. I believe in a lot of things that tend to be conservative, but the fact of the matter is that a strong dollar policy has a lot of impact on the United States, as my partner Rick has pointed out. It would hurt us dramatically if that happened, and also, the dollar has a very strong impact on the rest of the world. If you're looking at the easy side of this from the U.S.'s point of view, what impact does a strong dollar have? Well, for a start it has a lot of impact on jobs in Ohio, in Michigan, in places where we actually produce things in the United States, because the stronger our dollar is, the less likely it is we are to have a manufacturing sector. In 1985, when the U.S. had a strong dollar policy, and after a while a stated strong dollar policy under Ronald Reagan and Volcker, we began to develop something that we now call, and it came into practice then, the rust belt. And the reason that was the rust belt is all of a sudden we couldn't produce anything that could compete with the rest of the world because the dollar was too damn strong. So now we all drive Mercedes and Toyotas and whatever, we do not drive things that come out of Michigan. Now, let's face it, Michigan has other problems, and if you were -- I know I'm going to get defeated on this, Toyotas are all made in the United States, Hondas are made in the United States, yeah, in Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama. There are reasons for that. But the fact of the matter is that the strong dollar -- the weak dollar today has brought these European and Japanese companies into the United States, even Korean, and if we had a strong dollar they would go, too. One of the things that the Japanese are trying to do with their latest effort is to make the Toyota plants come back to Japan so that they can actually employ Japanese to make Toyotas instead of people from Kentucky or Tennessee. So the dollar is very, very important domestically for us, and basically if you have a strong dollar you end up with a situation where the rich get richer and there aren't a hell of a lot of jobs.  How does the world do with the dollar? A strong dollar is bad for the world as well. And it's kind of perverse, because if you would argue that, oh, gee whiz, if you’ve got a strong dollar, then anybody can sell anything to us. Right? Because everything looks cheap to us, right? And I must say that, you know, in the 1960s everything did look cheap to us. Now a lot of things look quite expensive. In fact, one of the worst things about a weak dollar is the fact that we can't go to Europe on vacation; it's too damn expensive. If we had a strong dollar, Europe would be cheap and we could all go on vacation, but at the same time, all the New York City hotels would be empty, whereas now you walk around the New York City hotels, well, they're just loaded with people from places that I never thought could possibly afford New York. And it's always interesting for me to sit and talk with somebody and have him tell me how much more expensive Belgrade is than New York. That's like, What? You got to be kidding. But they were serious But overseas, it's a little difficult to understand, but if the dollar is declining, then it's very inexpensive to build a plant, to finance your trade, because a weak dollar, which is the global currency because the dollar has been out there for years -- a weak dollar is the thing that you finance your trade in. And if you know the dollar is going to be weaker in a year or two or three, you don't repay it. You might be paying 6 percent for your dollars, but hell, if the dollar goes down 10 percent a year, you're paying minus 4. So it's a gift. So when the dollar is weak, people borrow money from Citibank, from JP Morgan, from Goldman Sachs, the people doing these deals, and our banking system does very well. When the dollar is strong, all of a sudden these people are, Oh, my god, I now owe more for this loan, and my plant that I built in Thailand isn't as successful as I thought, and so I have to close it down and I have to lay off workers. So when the dollar gets strong, all of a sudden the rest of the world economies go down, and so, actually, the United States is in a bit of a problem. Can we have a strong dollar policy? We argue strongly that we can't, because there is no place for us to do it. We have to support the world. "

    "data":"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all very much for coming here tonight. I want to emphasize with Jim that we believe in a strong and stable dollar. We don't like inflation; we don't like deflation. We like flation. Stability. Money makes all this easier, more convenient to do those transactions. So we got coins in Lydia 2,600 years ago. Then Athens picked it up, became a great commercial and cultural center. Got coins, and then paper, and then blips on a computer, but all of it means it makes it easier to do commerce, makes it easier to buy and sell with one another. That's the function of money. If we had barter today, imagine what it would be like, trying to deposit a cow into an ATM or take out a pig from an ATM. So we have money, and money is like anything, fixed weight and measure. If it has a fixed value, it becomes extremely useful. This -- so let's lead. What is money? Money makes it easier to buy and sell with one another, to do transactions with each other. It is through buying and selling that wealth is ultimately created, doing things, interacting with each other. Before we had money, in the old days we had barter. If I sold an ad in Forbes Magazine 3,000 years ago, how would I get paid? Perhaps with a herd of goats. Let's say I wanted to buy iPads for our writers, so I go to the iPad store 3,000 years ago with my goats. Store owner says he doesn't want goats; he wants sheep. So then I have to figure out how I swap my goats for sheep. Perhaps I have to hire a sheep herder so the wolves don't eat the sheep. Sheep herder wants to be paid in wine. I've got red wine; he wants white wine. So it becomes very, very cumbersome. We have -- when you go to the supermarket, say, buy a pound of hamburger, you assume it has 16 ounces, not 18, not 12. We don't float that pound from the British pound. But you know when you go to the market, 16 ounces. Twelve inches in a foot, that doesn't float. Imagine building a house 3,000 square feet if the rule floats each day. Take -- what would your life be like if the Federal Reserve did to the clock what it does to the dollar? Float the clock. So it's 60 minutes in an hour one day, 20 minutes the next, 22 the next, 90 the next. You'd soon need to have hedges, derivatives futures, to figure out how many hours you're working.  So let's say you hire somebody, 15 bucks an hour, do you pay that -- is that a New York hour? New Jersey hour? Bangladesh hour? Let's say you're baking a cake. It says bake the batter 45 minutes. You have to figure out, is that an inflation-adjusted minute? So a weak dollar, unstable dollar, makes commerce harder, and it has very destructive impacts. First of all, it misdirects investment. Without investment, we don't get a higher standard of living. A weak dollar is like a virus in a computer, corrupts the information. When the dollar becomes weak, what happens to the flow of investment money? It becomes defensive. It goes into commodities. Try to preserve what you have instead of invest to grow in the future. You saw it in the 1970s. $3 oil went to $40 a barrel. When Reagan and Volcker stabilized the dollar in the '80s, crashed down to $10, stabilized to $20. From the mid-1980s to the early part of this last decade when the Fed went off the rails again, dollar average -- average price of a barrel of oil more than $21. And now look what it is today, $80, $90. You saw it with the housing. We had an artificial housing boom in the late '70s, even worse one this time. The housing bubble could not have happened without a weak dollar. So you get financial bubbles. Another thing that happens is, when you have a week currency, real wages go down, which is why the median income in the country's gone nowhere for 10 years. Your salaries go down in real terms, which is why after 40 years of this nonsense, of having floating dollars like a floating clock, it takes two incomes in the family to do what one income could do several generations ago. So when the dollar goes down in value, you pay more for food; you pay more for gas; you pay more for electricity, which means money -- less money for other things. And so U.S. median incomes, as I mentioned, went down. And so workers do better when you have, in terms of improving their standard of living, people do better when they're in countries where the currency is stable, and they do worse in currency -- in countries over time that have weak currencies. It also harms our security. Weak money, as I mentioned, has an artificial boost to commodity prices, particularly oil. That means vast transfers of wealth to commodity producers and the like, and also vast transfers lending trillions of dollars to countries unfriendly to the U.S. like Iran, Venezuela, and Russia. Weak dollar also has a moral dimension. It undermines social trust. It severs, or certainly weakens, the link between effort and reward. Wealth and progress is achieved less by hard work like gaining new skills, perhaps starting a new business, and more by speculation and gambling. Weak dollar means windfall gains, as I mentioned, for commodities and for exotic financial instruments and hurts small businesses and many start-ups. Faith in the future is undermined because it then suddenly becomes the present. Hard work is made a mockery of. You worry about whether you and your children, your grandchildren, are going to have a higher standard of living. The economy seems more like a casino rather than something where hard work can get you a better life. John Maynard Keynes summed it up very well. Keynes said, Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than a debauched currency. That is, weaken the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner in which not one man in a million is able to diagnose. What this means is, what we see happening today, this feeling that something is not right, this feeling that speculation, doing exotic financial instruments, greedy oil companies and the like is the way to get ahead instead of hard work -- it all relates to a weak and unstable currency. So just as you want 60 minutes in an hour, just as you want 16 ounces in a pounds, just as you want 5,280 feet in a mile, you need stability, fixed measure of value. That's all the dollar is, makes it easier to do commerce when it's stable in value. You do more commerce, pure productive commerce. So bottom line is, wages suffer, investment gets skewed, we don't have a higher standing living that we would have had, and it weakens social trust. Stable dollar is what we need, not funny money from politicians who think they know how to do our lives better than we do. Thank you. "

    "data":"The question before the house is, “Is a booming China, does a booming China spell trouble for America?” The answer, in my view, is a resounding yes. In the next few minutes, I’m going to explain why. But first, what I call “the China threat,” which is something that Beijing likes to refer to as “the China threat theory,” is in fact real. Uh, it is a danger and it is growing. Um, as a, as the late CIA analyst and White House National Security Council official, Constantin Menges put it in his book China: The Gathering Threat, he said the reason that China poses a threat is because, despite its economic reforms, it is today ruled by a nuclear armed Communist dictatorship. This is the source of, of the trouble. I’ve identified what I call eleven sources of trouble for the United States from China, and I’m going to list them for you, and then talk briefly with the time remaining on, in some detail on it. The first is China’s military buildup. Number two is the danger of war over Taiwan. Number three is expansionism over energy resources. Number four is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles. Number five is massive intelligence operations to steal U.S. secrets and technology. Number six is influence operations and so-called money diplomacy. Number seven is unfair trade practices, including currency valuation manipulation. Number eight, intellectual property theft. Number nine, human rights abuses. Number ten, religious repression. And number eleven, environmental degradation and global warming. To start with, the most serious trouble for America from China is China’s military buildup. On January eleventh of this year, China conducted an unprecedented anti-satellite missile test. They fired a missile that traveled through space and hit a low Earth orbit satellite, a Chinese weather satellite, destroying it and creating, uh, sixteen thousand pieces of debris, which pose a threat to other satellites. U.S. official were shocked by this development because U.S. intelligence estimates of China’s military have been stating for years that China is ten, fifteen, maybe twenty years behind the United States. That it is so far behind that there is no way China’s military could pose a threat. What the Chinese ASAT [anti-satellite] test showed was that China is not seeking to follow the U.S. missile for missile, ship for ship, submarine for submarine. They’re going after niche weapons, they’re trying to leap ahead with special technology, and they’re doing this in a number of key areas, one of which is anti-satellite weapons. Officials in Washington estimate that by, within the next, uh, six years, China will have the capability of destroying all U.S. low Earth orbit satellites. Basically, this could be the modern day equivalent of a space Pearl Harbor against the United States if there were a conflict over Taiwan. Regarding Taiwan, the danger of war over the Taiwan Strait continues. China has not renounced the, its plan to use force to retake the island. It is applying pressure, across the board, uh, to pressure this democracy. It is succeeding in many ways to influencing U.S. policy in ways that would diminish support for this traditional ally. The danger of China expanding to gain resources is kind of a new, uh, source of trouble that has been identified by some studies in the Pentagon one of which was called the so-called “string of pearls strategy.” It shows that China, uh, is developing a string of pearls, bases, alliances along a path going from the Middle East, where all of its, much of its oil comes from, all the way to China. There are very much concerns that because energy is so, uh, integral to China’s modernization effort, that China at some point will have to expand militarily, perhaps the Russian Far East, perhaps Southeast Asia, uh, to take over, uh, places that have, uh, valuable oil and gas resources. Intelligence operations. Uh, this is a subject that I have focused on in my recent book. It also, uh, highlights the case of Chi Mak, who was a Chinese intelligence agent, recently convicted in California of uh, of being an unregistered agent of the Chinese government. It’s part of a, a mushrooming spy case, more of which will be coming out in, in the coming weeks and months, uh, which shows that China has been very successful in stealing some of the most advanced U.S. weapons technology, including the next generation quiet electric drive for our war ships, uh, secrets about our submarine force, and as well as the AEGIS battle management system, which is the heart of the, the modern Navy. As for influence operations, this is another area where China has been extremely successful in influencing policies, uh, against the United States. We see this through so- called, what one Chinese defector called “money diplomacy,” uh, buying up former U.S. officials, and using those officials to lobby against policies that China doesn’t like. Uh, this is having a, a deleterious effect on the U.S. economy and U.S. policy because it’s preventing the United States from truly understanding the directions and goals of China’s military modernization and its, uh, its general modernization as well. Representative Randy Forbes, the chairman of the China caucus in the House of Representatives estimates that China spends upwards of one hundred million dollars annually, uh, on these influence operations. Unfair trade practices and currency issues, as well as, uh, uh, intellectual property theft. These issues are fairly well known, but I would like to highlight one issue surrounding the whole trade question. The main policy for the United States towards China has been to trade with China as a way to seek a liberalized Chinese government and political system. Unfortunately, the idea of trading with China as a liberal, a liberalizing factor is not working. In fact, just the other, just the opposite is happening. Uh, many feel that China’s buildup, its military buildup is being benefited by its economic growth, but yet we have seen little or no political reform in China. This is a, a very serious source of trouble for the United States. On human rights abuses, I would also point out how, at its core, China has never fully resolved that the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, when pro-democracy protesters……occupied the square. Um, as well, religious re-, repression is also in this field, as well as environmental degradation. Uh, as many as seven out of ten Chinese major rivers are now dead. This debate has often been couched as, as between engagement and contained, but really, the, the issue here is that what China needs is Democracy, and that is really the, the solution to mitigating these sources of trouble for the United States."

    "data":"Good evening. Let me begin with a dangerous confession. I love Fu Manchu novels. I have read them all, I have seem every movie version that I can get my hand on. Nothing sends shudders up my spine so much as contemplating sinister Chinese scheming to control the world.So when I was confronted with the question of whether a booming China spells trouble for the United States, my natural instinct was to think of Fu Man Chu, and to give a resounding yes. But then I remembered that I had majored in History in college, not in the world’s great literature. When you look at what’s happening in China in terms of history and not in terms of fantasy fiction, you are forced to a very different conclusion. I grew up in wartime China, I was in China as a high school student at the time of the Communist revolution in 1949, I visited China three times during the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution. When I visit China now, the situation is so different and so much better than China was in those days. Nevertheless, the question before you is a serious one. Any country of 1.3 billion people can spell trouble for us or for the global system. I have dealt with China professionally for over thirty years, it has been troublesome throughout that period, our relations have improved, we have done well. But this is true that China can cause trouble, whether it’s in boom or bust. A China that is floundering with a sense of grievance against the world and disaffected with the international system would be a greater danger than a booming China that can feed and clothe its people, educate them domestically and abroad, buy vast amounts of U.S. goods and services, and benefit from the international system. That’s a far preferable outcome. Can we handle China’s troublesome aspects? Of course we can. We’re the world’ premiere military power. We have the most large, we have the largest and most productive economy in the world. We’re improving our military technology at a rate faster than China is. We have the world’s, I mentioned the economy, we’re a global leader in science and technology, our schools and graduate schools are the envy of the world. The one requirement for handling any trouble that China causes is that we manage our domestic and international affairs so that we don’t squander the enormous advantages that we have. Remember, trouble for us spells even bigger trouble for China. The advantage is on our side, not China’s. Seven successive U.S. presidents over a space of thirty-five years have discovered that contain-, that containing troubles and developing common interests with China benefits us. Three successive generations of Chinese leaders have come to the same conclusion. Such a track record should give us confidence. What’s more, experience over the last fifteen years of China’s rapid growth shows clearly that a booming China offers enormous opportunities for the United States, and holds out the prospect of positive change in the future. China’s rapid growth has created an enormous middle class, concentrated in China’s coastal provinces. This new middle class enjoys a level of affluence unthinkable in the 1970’s. These middle class Chinese are educated, entrepreneurial, and outward looking. They have more in common with the middle classes elsewhere in Asia than they have with the on-, the backward parts of their own country. They represent the building blocks for China’s eventual transition to a more representative form of government. China’s society is remarkably more open than it was before. Hundreds of thousands of China’s best and brightest have been sent to the west, and primarily to the United States to study, the work, and the spend years here. Western educated Chinese now occupy significant positions at all levels of government, business, and education in China. Totally absent thirty years ago. In essence, China has abandoned Marxism and Leninism and class struggle in favor of Marxism eco-, uh, market economics and promotion of a harmonious society. Obviously, as China’s economy continues to grow, and as its military capabilities improve, we have to consider the possibility that a more powerful and prosperous China will become a security threat. A highly nationalistic China under poor leaders or under bad leaders would pose serious problems for us and for the global community. Two aspects are of particular concern. China’s military spending has been growing at double digit rates for the last fifteen years, China’s defense forces are preparing for Taiwan scenarios, that include the possibility of U.S. intervention. Does this mean we should sound the alarms, and assume that conflict with China is inevitable over Taiwan? The answer is no. The situation calls for vigi-, vigilance, not for alarm. U.S. military leaders are not sitting on their thumbs. They’re constantly improving our force posture, they’re pointedly confident that we can handle any challenges and they believe that conflict can be avoided. Such confidence is warranted. We in China have developed an effective framework from ma-managing the Taiwan issue. Both countries, the United States and China have stated that they are opposed to unilateral changes in the status quo with respect to Taiwan. In addition, enormous common interests have developed on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, interests missing, before we befriended China. Taiwan has brought over a hundred billion dollars of investment into the mainland. Millions of Taiwanese visit the mainland. Taiwan exports more across the Taiwan Straits now than it does to the United States. In the meantime, Taiwan runs its own affairs, it elects its own presidents, and it benefits from membership in the World Trade Organization and in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. In per capita GDP terms, Taiwan ranks just behind the European Union and ahead of countries such as Spain, New Zealand, and South Korea. It would require ineptitude on a massive scale in Beijing, Washington, and Taipei for this situation to generate into a military conflict. To conclude, an alarmist view of China exaggerates the dangers and obscures the opportunities. China’s economy is now ten times larger than it was in 1978 and our relations with China are better. And China has significant defense liabilities. Its most modern, advanced military equipment comes from Russia, an unreliable source. After years of rapid growth, China now in defense spending, China now spends approximately the same percentage of GDP that we do, but its GDP is much smaller than ours. Its, its defense budget is less than half of the combined defense budgets of the UK, France, Germany, and Italy, all part of the European Union with a common defense policy. My experience in Asia has made me an optimist. I lived in Taiwan under an authoritarian regime. It’s now a thriving democracy. I lived in Thailand twice under military-dominated governments, only to see it move to, for a period uh, to thriving parliamentary democracy. I was in Indonesia when an authoritative – Gave way. To sum up, the troubles produced by China booming are manageable, the opportunities are encouraging, the outlook is hopeful if we display the traditional qualities that made us a great country"

    "data":"Thank you very much. As all of you know, here in sophisticated New York, State Department and Defense Department often don’t get along. So it may come as a surprise to you – it certainly comes to a surprise to me – that I agree with every word of what Stapleton Roy just said. In fact, I believe our team wants to adopt him as a fourth member of our team, because he essentially is speaking in favor of the motion uh, as we see it. And I want to ask for your support for the motion in the way we define the two key words in the motion. The first word is “beware.” And we take that to mean be wary, be wary. The second key word, Bill Gertz went over eleven examples, is “trouble,” “spells trouble.” In other words, the burden on the other team to earn your vote is to say you should not beware, you should be blithely sort of confident that there will be no problems at all with China. They have to sustain that case. Then they have to sustain the case that there will be no trouble from China, forever. It seems to me it should be unanimous tonight that our team is going to win, especially since Stapleton Roy essentially is working for us. I do want to say he characterized the Defense Department’s view of China quite correctly, that’s very accurate. Uh, going back for fifteen years now, Secretaries of Defense and chairmen of the Joint Chiefs have said over and over and over that China is not a threat to the United States. In fact, often they embellish and say China, for the foreseeable future, will not be a threat. So that’s the public position of the Pentagon. It’s not looking for a war, there’s a very high level of confidence uh, that we will prevail in any conflict with China. Um and what you actually get is a series of factual reports each year that come out that list the eleven examples of trouble that Bill Gertz gave as factual matters. But Mr. Roy, Ambassador Roy is correct that there’s a sense of confidence and not seeking any sort of conflict from China in the Pentagon. There’s a sense of , that China is not a threat. And frankly, I have, since we’re telling autobiographical stories, I have had about thirty-five years meeting with Chinese generals uh, from the first meet up here in the United Nations not far from here all the way to last week when the Delegation of Generals was hosted by us in the Pentagon. Enormous changes have taken place but not necessarily for the, for the better. If you go back all the way to the beginning of the U.S. Military relationship with the Chinese Communists, it’s really 1944 that we began to do some intelligence cooperation against the Japanese in the middle of World War II. That came out of something called the Dixie Mission that some of you, I think in the audience, look like you remember it. But six years later, six years later we’re at war with China. Tragic, tragic war where the Chinese to this day claimed they warned us. They used this strange phrase about “we won't put our hands in our sleeves” and that was supposed to mean we’re going to send three hundred thousand troops in and destroy American forces. We didn’t understand it that way. And a tragic, avoidable war took place. Twenty years of containment passed, another cycle began of military cooperation between the U.S. and China. Uh, our generals and theirs have met hundreds of times. We in the eighties, under President Reagan, who certainly would yield to nobody in his anti-Communism, President Reagan authorized the sale of six American sophisticated weapon systems to China. Again a peak, by the end of 1944 when we were cooperating closely with the Chinese. You almost couldn't have had more security cooperation than we did under President Reagan with China. Three years later, 1989, it had to all be canceled and not far from here out in Bethpage, Long Island, two Chinese jet fighters sort of MiG23 jet fighters had to be crated up and sent back to China. And we refunded part of their money because of the Tiananmen incident and the heart wrenching effect it had on American hopes for democracy and human rights in China. Then in the last fifteen or sixteen years, there have been ups and downs as Stapleton Roy correctly pointed out. But we’ve never gotten a pledge from China not to use force against Taiwan. We’ve never settled, we’ve never really gotten credit for what Henry Kissinger did. Uh, President Nixon withdrew American nuclear weapons from Taiwan. President Nixon severed the military connection. President Carter severed the fact that we kept two American generals there, one for arms supply, one to plan war with the Defense of Taiwan in mind. The Chinese take that, those major concessions from us as though they never happened. And the Chinese rhetoric today continues to talk about how the U.S., if it even sells one bullet to Taiwan, this somehow strengthens the independence forces on Taiwan. It’s simply not true. We have enormous self-imposed restrictions on our arms sales to Taiwan. So across the board, we have a lack of progress in Chinese nationalistic attitudes toward America. If you pull out an average Chinese Youth Daily article today and you look up what does it say about the United States, it’s not very friendly. We have fifteen major programs now in foreign aid, in helping their banking system through our Treasury Department. Our Labor Department has a mediation service, going to help them with labor disputes. Every department of the U.S. government has what, in my view amounts to an aid program, a program of engagement with China. Very seldom mentioned in the Chinese press. If you're a young Chinese, you have the impression that America is trying to dismember China, that America poses a military threat, that America’s working with India and Japan to somehow crush China or contain its rise. All of this nationalistic rhetoric ought to be banned in the Chinese press. We don’t say these things in our press, but it hasn’t stopped the worst was 1999, I might point out, when the front page of the Communist Party Daily, People’s Daily, carried a long article called “The Seven Ways America is Worse than Nazi Germany.” And it went into detail about which kind of gas the Nazis had used in their camps, and then there was a paragraph, I’ll never forget it, saying the Americans are even worse than that. So to support our side of this debate, you have to be wary, that is look for possibilities that might happen in the future where things may not be as rosy as we may have hoped. And you have to admit there’s trouble. That’s, that’s all we, we ask for our side. And I hope it will be unanimous, but we don’t, we don’t have to be, our side doesn’t have to be extreme. We don’t have to be alarmist about China, we don’t have to forecast an inevitable war. We don’t have to say that we should break off all relations. I mention to you the fifteen aid programs, I want to close my last sentence with just one of the most impressive, to me, we have more than fifty agreements, governmental agreements to transfer American scientific findings to China for free. Our National Science Foundation, our White House Office of Science and Technology Policy are in charge of this—Chinese don’t really make a big deal out of it, but it’s an amazing program…"

    "data":"Thank you very much James and uh, it’s a pleasure to be here this evening. I want to start by saying welcome to New York uh, to those supporting tonight’s proposition. While neo-cons and liberals alike uh, down in the Beltway in Washington and from other places around the country debate the theory and these concepts of grand strategy to do with China, we here in New York have been working very, very hard of course in our many professions to try to understand the nature of its reform, its growth, and make sure that we benefit as a nation from what’s the epic changes taking place in this country, making sure that we don’t gauge China against the uh, abject failures of thirty, forty, fifty years ago, some of which have already been cited. But instead, recognize that China is not at all standing still uh, and is very much a work in progress. So I for one, very much look forward to the chance to debate these issues here tonight, the notion that China’s strengthening is bad news for us, which is really what we’re talking about of course. China’s boom is essentially economic at its core. So the role that uh, has been cast for me is to lay out three critical economic arguments uh, for why, whether you're a New Yorker or not, uh, you should be very much against the motion that we have on the table before us this evening. First argument, China’s boom is benefiting others in a big way, not just China. Secondly, that its growth is very much helping its people, not repressing them, and thus mitigating, in an important way, many threats that we’d have to deal with if China were not growing. And thirdly, that we the United States together with China, have larger economic responsibilities of a global nature that demand our mutual respect and our enthusiasm, in fact, instead of confrontation with China over its growth and strengthening. Which indeed is what uh, is what we’re, we’re here to debate. Let me exch-, uh, explain each of these very briefly. First of all, China’s growth is benefiting the economies of rich and poor nations alike. Japan, with merely forty percent of the labor force that the United States has, exports ten billion dollars worth of goods to China every month. The United States only exports half that amount. Germany, with a mere one-quarter of our labor force, has run a net trade surplus with China over the period 1992 to today. The point of this is China is not an economy that is closed to rich-world exports at all. It’s very much open to them. Developing nations, in Southeast Asia, in Latin America, in Africa, are also benefiting in a way the World Bank couldn't have imagined a few years ago from China’s dynamic growth. It’s embracing China as a new destination for exports. Even Taiwan, that’s of such concern to us all here at this table, is in fact enjoying a sixty-six billion dollar a year trade surplus with its archenemy uh, the People’s Republic of China, a trade surplus which has grown from fourteen to forty percent every year of this decade so far. Taiwan in fact is moving away from the attitude behind the motion on the table this evening, away from confrontation and toward a working out of things in a peaceful manner, a deepening and integrating its economy with the mainland’s. Bottom line: our fortunes here depend on what we do, on how we compete with China, not on what China does. We should spend more time competing with Germany and Japan, in fact, for the Chinese market, and less time blaming China for all of our troubles. Of course the United States is already a major beneficiary of China’s economic activity. If we cut off all trade with China tomorrow, we would create very few American jobs, we would import practically everything we import from China, but from other countries at a higher price, which wouldn't really benefit anybody in this country. Second major argument I want to make: China’s growth benefits its people and by doing so, mitigates profound troubles that would eventuate, if that were not the case. The real threats, the existential threat, threats to the United States today come from impoverished and stagnant states writhen by discontent and insecurity. North Korea, Iran, Iraq, the Middle East in general, stagnant economic situations in Sudan, in Venezuela, these are what, these are the engines that breed terrorism and nihilism which are the true threat and trouble we should be concerning ourselves with. China could have been among those. In fact the China of 1978, before the dreaded boom that we’re here to debate this evening, would have been one of those, by embracing our economic model in fact, which is what they’ve done, they’ve grown beyond that danger. And though eight hundred million Chinese are still poor by our standards, they’re striving toward prosperity and not toward extremism. Those people, those toiling Chinese are the boom that we’re here to pass judgment on this evening. And while their toil brings competitive challenges for us, we would be gravely mistaken to try to turn back the clock to the failed state China was before this boom began. Prosperity is not an alternative to political change in China. In fact, it’s been the handmaiden of it. The totalitarian government ruling two hundred dollar per capita China in 1978 bears practically no resemblance to the Chinese government managing a two thousand dollar per capita economy today. Likewise, the Chinese government that runs ten thousand dollar per capita China tomorrow will be vastly different than the one we deal with today. Third major argument: beyond our narrow economic interests – and theirs – lie global economic responsibilities that must be addressed cooperatively. Tonight we’re debating whether the benefits of a stronger China are worth the trouble it brings us along the way, or rather, whether the troubles of a stagnant China would suit our interests better, because that’s really the question. It’s which set of troubles suits the American interest and which does not? It’s a reasonable question, but such a narrow-minded calculus of self-interest alone does not befit a great power and certainly does not befit the United States. Economic success, foremost ours and now China’s as well, is creating a great economic, political, and indeed security challenge, climate change and an environmental crisis globally. The U.S. has refused to address its responsibility to carbon, on carbon emissions. And the reason given: China. A con- convenient fits-all-purposes ex-excuse not to act when you don’t want to act. China, interestingly enough, has refused to exact uh, except carbon commitments for the same reason. The United States should go first. This log jam is fueled by the mistrust that tonight’s motion puts forward, and indeed it cannot be permitted to stand. We have an economic responsibility to the planet to deal with this together or we’re going to lose more than anybody does. To finish, let me say this, I have a private practice in addition to being a think tanker and professor. And my customers are troubles. They’re troubles I’d like to have more of, frankly. I don't have a problem with troubles, we have more troubles with Canada economically than we do with any other country. Is that bad news for the United States? It’s not, it’s part of a mature relationship. Those in favor of tonight’s motion counsel a strategy meant to leave China in ruins using a play book last used in the Cold War, building up our military instead of our economy. Who will join us in such a strategy? I urge you to vote against tonight’s motion. The troubles of a stagnant, unbooming China –"

    "data":"The question on the table is does a rising China spell trouble for the United States. Or in slightly different words from an American perspective, is a powerful China likely to be bad for the United States? I think the answer is axiomatically yes. And I say this not because I feel any personal hostility towards the Chinese, which I certainly don’t, or because I think China is particularly aggressive because it was or is a Communist country or it is run in an authoritarian political form. I think that matters very little and I don't say it because I think China’s likely to behave irrationally in the future. My argument is that the best situation for the United States from the perspective of maximizing its security is to be the most powerful state in the international system. The bigger the gap between you and everybody else, the more secure you are. To put it in Pentagonese, you don’t want a peer competitor in your national system. To give you two examples that highlight this point, think about the United States and its two immediate neighbors, Canada and Mexico. As you know, we are much more powerful than either one of those countries. None of you go to bed at night worrying about Canada or Mexico attacking the United States tomorrow, next week, or next year. That’s simply not going to happen because we’re so powerful. Would you trade the present situation for one where Canada and Mexico or Canada or Mexico was twice as powerful as the United States? Of course you wouldn't, it’s much better to have a situation where we’re the most powerful state in the Western hemisphere. Same basic logic applies to China. If China has two choices, one it can have a Japan in Asia that’s five times more powerful than China, or a situation where China is five more, five times more powerful than Japan. Which one of those alternatives do you think the Chinese will choose? It’s an open-and-shut case. They’d much prefer to be five times more powerful. And the same basic argument applies to the United States and China. Today, tomorrow, or at any point in time. If you have a choice of being as powerful or less powerful than China, or being more powerful, which would you choose if you're interested in maximizing your security? An open and shut case. Let me spell out the logic that underpins my argument. Principal goal of any state in the international system, it’s not the only goal, but the principal goal is survival. And the reason is, if you don’t survive, you can’t pursue any other goals. The problem that states have is they operate in an anarchic system. That’s political science speak for saying that they operate in a system where there’s no higher authority that you can turn to if you get into trouble. [In other words, if you dial 911 in a crisis in international politics, there’s nobody at the other end. In a system like that, where you're dealing with other states whose intentions you can never be certain of, and you want to understand here that it’s impossible for the United States to discern what Chinese intentions will be ten years from now, twenty years from now, thirty years from now. We don’t know what those intentions will be. In a system where you can’t discern intentions, and where there is no higher authority that you can turn to when you're in trouble, the best way to maximize your chances of surviving is to make sure that you are by far the most powerful sys-, state in the international system. To put it in colloquial terms, you want to be the biggest and baddest dude on the block, so that nobody fools around with you. To put it in political science speak, you want to be a hegemony. Now the question is, what does the system look like today? Situation today from an American point of view is ideal. We’re by far the most powerful state on earth. We dominate the Western hemisphere. There’s no state in our uh, region of the world that could possibly challenge us. We have tremendous power projection capabilities, which is why we’re called the only superpower in the world. And in Asia and in Europe, the two areas of the world where there are other great powers or potential great powers, we have no peer competitor. There’s no imperial Japan, there’s no imperial Germany, there’s no Nazi Germany, and there’s no Soviet Union. From an American point of view, that’s a wonderful situation. Now, what is the future going to look like if in say, twenty years, China continues to grow economically the way it has grown over the last twenty years? What you're going to get is a country that’s economically pretty close to being as strong as the United States, and you could rest assured that China’s going to turn that economic might into military might. They’d be foolish if they didn’t. You’ll then have a country that’s roughly uh, the military equivalent of the United States, or at least close to it. That country is going to try to dominate Asia the way the United States has successfully dominated the western hemisphere. They’d be fools to do otherwise. Do you think the founding fathers and their successors in this country were fools because they had attempted to establish, and did establish a Germany in the Western hemisphere? Of course not. They did it for good security reasons. The Asians will do the same, the Chinese will do the same thing in Asia. We have a Monroe Doctrine here in the United States. Most of you know it very well. We basically tell the European and Asian great powers that they have to stay out of our hemisphere. We don’t want them here. Don’t you think the Chinese are going to feel the same way in Asia when they’re powerful enough to think about dominating Asia? Furthermore, they’re going to dominate, develop significant power projection capability just like we have developed power projection capability. They’re going to develop a blue water navy and that navy is going to be designed to go into the Middle East, much the way our navy is designed to go in the Middle East. When I was a young boy, my mother used to say what’s good for the goose is good for the gander. If it’s good for the United States, why don’t you think it’ll be good for China to try and dominate Asia and to try and develop significant power projection capability? Of course this all raises the question then, how is the United States likely to react? It’s very simple. We have a clear record here of how we’ll react when other countries try to dominate either Europe or Asia. We go to great lengths to stop them. Imperial Germany, imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and the former Soviet Union, they’re all on the scrap heap of history. And we played a key role in putting them there. The United States will not tolerate a situation where China tries to dominate Asia. And as I said, China will try to dominate Asia just the way the United States has tried to dominate and has succeeded at dominating the Western hemisphere. What is my bottom line here? My bottom line is straightforward. The present situation is better for the United States and more stable than a world –In which China is as powerful or almost as powerful as the United States. In other words, if China rises, trouble is in store for the United States. Thank you."

    "data":"Well I, my name is Jim McGregor and I’ve lived in China for twenty years. And I'm just grateful that I did not make Bill Gertz’s list of eleven threats from China. Um it’s kind of intimidating being here among all these Ph.D.s and well studied men. I ended up in China because I was expelled from high school. Um, I joined the army when I got expelled from high school, they sent me to Vietnam, that turned my head towards Asia, led to me becoming a journalist. And as time went on, I wanted to get back to Asia as a journalist, so I went to China in ’85 and backpacked through the country. Um, ’87, I moved to Taiwan to learn Mandarin and I’ve lived in Beijing since ’90, both as a journalist and a businessperson. All of the theories that I’ve heard tonight, I’ve read many times. My view is more kind of grass roots what China looks like on the ground and what I’ve seen. Um, when I first moved to China as a reporter, I had secret police following, my phone was tapped. Even the maid who took care of our nanny who helped us with our daughter was from the foreign ministry and made reports on us. Um and this was a country that was just really emerging from the forest fire of the Cultural Revolution. And what I’ve seen since then has been kind of documented by other speakers here tonight on the fast growth. I’ve watched, the first uh, financial person I met in China was a guy named Milen Xiong [PH] who was a, a steel worker who had cornered the market on the four stocks on the illegal Shanghai stock market. Um and now China’s um, doing the world’s largest IPOs and in fact Chinese stocks were the top performers on NASDAQ last year. When I first got to Beijing in the fall, you had big piles of cabbage on the corner because that was the only vegetable they got. People would bring it home, they’d shove it under their bed or in their cabinets and over the winter, you’d tear away the rotten leaves and you could eat the fresh leaves inside. Well as you know, now, if I don’t see a new high rise everyday, I get a little jittery, it’s moving so fast. Um international sophistication, when I went there in ’85, people would come up to me on the street and show me around for the day because they were so excited to learn about the outside world. While we’ve had six hundred thousand students alone from China come to the United States, Chinese people are very international, traveling the world, doing business um, and even being involved in uh, academic uh, endeavors in the United States. So we’ve learned that China’s a very formidable country tonight and we better be scared of them um, because why? Well China has grown very fast and it’s moving very fast, but what has happened during this period? China has been shoving all kinds of problems under the carpet. The carpet’s getting lumpy and the country will trip on these problems and it’s going to be very busy for the new few decades fixing this. Environment, China is trash. Sixteen of the twenty worst air-polluted cities in the world are in China. I’ve traveled every province of China and I’ve never seen a clean body of water that was not in a bottle. Um, healthcare, from a fairly decent healthcare system has become very commercial. Two-thirds of people don’t have healthcare. If you're a peasant and your kid gets cancer, what do you do? You beg, borrow, and steal money to get them to a hospital in a city. Uh, you have to deposit the money for your kid to be in that hospital. If you run out of money, they kick your kid out of that hospital. Um the have and the have-not issue is growing and growing. There was eighty thousand demonstrations two years ago. Last year they went down because they realized they better not be reporting on how many they had. Um and on and on party corruption, etcetera. So this is this uh, colossus that’s going to take on the United States. What does China really want? From a military standpoint, China wants to protect its wealth. It’s been a country that’s been colonized. It also wants to have the military projection to be able to protect it, protect its own sea lanes. Um from natural resources, China, the rocks have not been kind to China. They’re as dependent as we are or more on imported oil and other mat-, in iron ore and other raw materials. Um the government. The government is running scared of its own people. You’ve got to realize when you have ten, ten, ten percent economic growth for twenty years and kids are growing up under that kind of growth, they expect exponential improvement every year forever. And the government has really no credibility other than economic growth and giving people a better life. So where does the United States have to worry? Where do we really eclipse China? You can’t be a global leader without a leading ideology and China right now has no leading ideology other than getting rich. Uh, right now the United States isn’t so popular around the world uh, with Iraq and other issues. China is out working the world, but I’ll tell you, people are looking for U.S. leadership. We will not have trouble competing with China diplomatically. Financial world. New York um, you can walk down the street here and throw a rock in any direction, you're going to hit a trillion dollars in hedge funds. Um the Shanghai Bank still don’t have check-clearing mechanisms for private accounts. China’s moving ahead in, in the financial world. They’ve got a trillion dollar foreign exchange surplus and they’re in fact putting together a hundred twenty billion dollar hedge fund. But they are going to have to dependent on the U.S. and our financial system and cooperating with us for their money to be deployed well as well as the capital they need. Education.China’s built seven hundred universities in the last fifteen years. However, it still has stuffed ducks-style education where people are taught to memorize, not to think for themselves and not to analyze. The world, the world comes to America as long as we give them the visas to have the best in the world education system. We can absorb the brains of the world and stay ahead of anybody in the world. Um finally, I'm looking at my opponents here. I'm on the good guys team here on the left and uh, my opponents here, these are all learned men, they’re all PhDs. But take a look, there’s not a bit of suntan on any of those heads. Um they have, they have been sitting in offices in Washington and Chicago um, reading reports and putting together the world under, under theories. And that’s quite good, I'm happy to say that. And I'm not here, I'm not here to defend China. I'm here to defend America because um, if you say that we can’t handle the rise of China um, then you're voting against America tonight. I believe that you really have to vote no because if you vote yes, then you're voting against America. America can handle the rise of China. China’s got a lot of problems. And we’re going to, we’ve, we’ve handled many things in, in the life of this country. And we will handle this quite well. Thank you very much."

    "data":"John, thank you very much, and thank you for coming tonight, and Bloomberg, thank you for hosting the debate on the issues. Ideas have consequences, and debating ideas is always important for a free society. Since the Enlightenment it has generally been accepted that limited government is the key to freedom and that freedom is the key to unleashing human potential. Freedom has allowed ordinary people to do extraordinary things, and America is proof that freedom works. Across time and across nations the countries that were freest have tended to create more jobs, more growth, more opportunity, and more human happiness. Within our own country states that spend less, tax less, and do a better job of providing the rule of law have tended to grow fastest, to create the most jobs, and to have the most end migration where people vote with their feet for less government and more freedom. When economic freedom is imperiled, prosperity wanes. And our argument tonight is pretty simple. Our economic freedom is imperiled. Just two years ago the national debt of our country was 40 percent of our annual production. Two years later our national debt is 60 percent of annual production and under the current budget that Congress is operating on by the end of the decade our national debt will be 90 cents out of every dollar of goods and services produced annually by America. Interest payments on our national debt will quadruple in the next decade, and even if every assumption of the Obama budget proves valid, within 10 years it will take 40 cents out of every dollar of income taxes collected in America just to pay interest on the federal debt. If the Obama assumptions prove invalid, it could take as much as half of all income taxes collected in America in the year 2020, just to pay interest on the debt.If this is not a threat to our economic freedom, what is? What could be? This is big government stifling the American spirit. But the crisis is so much greater than these frightening numbers would lead you to believe. If you listen to Washington, this problem is easy to solve. All you’ve got to do is tax rich people. Well rich people already pay more of the taxes than at any time in American history. And the problem is there are just not enough of them. Our problem is if you every penny earned by every person or entity in the top one percent of the tax bracket, you couldn’t deal with our deficit, much less our debt. And it’s not reassuring to look at the fact that with tax rates as high as 70 percent we have never collected more than 19 percent of gross domestic product in taxes in peacetime in American history. You often hear the discussion about the top one percent as if these were rich people. But the reality is that since 1980, when we lowered marginal tax rates, small and medium size businesses have changed the way they’re taxed from corporate entities to being taxed as individuals. The finance committee has estimated that as much as two-thirds of all the income of all the tax returns filed in the top one percent of income earners comes from partnerships, proprietorships, pass-through structures, and sub-chapter S. In short, from small businesses filing as individuals. The policy that we’re told will tax John Q. Astor in reality will tax Joe Brown and Son Hardware Store, and here’s the rub: in recoveries, small businesses create two-thirds of the jobs. It is simply not feasible, given where we are in the economic cycle, to be raising taxes on small business. The solution to excess spending is not excess taxes; it’s less spending. If you’re in a hole and you can’t get out, the first thing you need to do is stop digging and stop digging now means stop spending. But if we can’t get our government to stop spending, how are we ever going to get them to reduce spending, to reform entitlements, to address Social Security, to address Medicare, to address Medicaid? Well let me suggest that we not give up on America and that we not give up our own confidence in the system. It’s important to remember that we overcame 10 percent unemployment, double-digit inflation, double-digit interest rates, economic stagnation, malaise, self-doubt and the Soviet Union in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan. It seems like an eternity ago but remember, a Republican congress worked with Bill Clinton to reform welfare and to balance the budget and to put America to work. We did it once. We can do it again. But we can’t do it with the same old programs and the same old politics as usual. Thank you all very much. "

    "data":"Thank you, and I’m honored to be part of this debate. And I should say that I was inspired to a world of debate by my son, who’s in the audience, who has devoted much of his college and high school career to debate. So I hope I do a good job as a debater. How big should the government be, is my question. And I think that depends. It depends upon the tasks and the challenges that government undertakes. It depends upon what its citizens want the government to do. The government in a democracy is us. We cannot blame the government. We have to look to ourselves. And one of the main points I want to make tonight is we don't do it. We refuse to do the arithmetic. We want the government to do a lot, and we don't want the government to pay for it. Now, let me start with the government and the tasks right now, because part of the introduction here was, is the government stifling the American spirit right now? I suggest we be students of history here. The U.S. has just gone through one of the world's largest financial crises in economic history. We know a lot about financial crises across our own economy over time and around the world. And we know that they are the result of a failure, a collapse, a mess created by the private sector, created by overleveraged banks, created by people who take on debt they cannot finance, created by people who engage in sophisticated trading, buy a credit default swap, don't even know what a credit default swap is. Think I'll buy one; it's an innovation. When you have a major financial crisis and the recession which follows, the government has to help clean up the mess. And we know this over time from the tulip crisis of several hundred years ago to today's financial crisis. And we know -- you know what we know? That when government's clean up the mess, that is stabilize the banking system, that is make sure demand deposits are there when you go to the bank, make sure your money market funds don't fall below a dollar, the government has to supply capital to the financial institutions to do that. The government has to also deal with the slowdown in the economy, the recession, the loss of job, the bankruptcies, the closures of plants. And that is what economic stimulus is meant to do. And does it work perfectly? No. Does it work? Yes. If you look at what government has done, and you look at the projections of any macro model in the U.S. economy, you will see that the stimulus was projected to produce about 3.5 million jobs. And that's exactly what it has done. So one thing I will say is that we are dealing right at a moment in time where we have a mess that has to be cleaned up. It's a little bit -- I think of it more broadly as governments have to clean up messes occasionally. For example, let's take Katrina. Let's take Hurricane Katrina. There was a failure to clean up a mess that was a government responsibility to clean up. And by the way, one of the reasons Hurricane Katrina caused so much damage, there was another government failure. The government didn't spend enough on the levees. The American Civil Engineering Society warned, D minus, for U.S. infrastructure on the levees. We failed to spend. We invited a natural disaster. We failed to clean up the mess. Second area where the government, I think, has a role to play. Think about the innovative spirit of the United States. Think about technology. Think about higher education. Think about NYU. Think about the University of California. You will see that education, higher education, investments in technology, the things that build America's innovative spirit, these are big parts of what the federal government should and does do. You love social networking? Trace it back to DARPA. You love the latest biotech drug? Trace it back to the National Institute of Health. You like traveling on jet aircraft? Trace it back to the Department of Defense. There are many ways in which the U.S. government has spent over many years to build education infrastructure and technology which play into the spirit of America. They are part of the innovative spirit of America. Now, there is a problem. A problem is that the government has, over time, been spending less on that as a share of total government spending. And it's been spending less on that as a share of our economy. Our economy's gotten bigger. Those kinds of government investments have become less important as a share of the economy. Why? What's going on? Well, one -- let's look for a minute at defense, because when we're thinking about the size of government, think about defense in the U.S. The U.S. has 4.3 percent of the world's population and spends 43 percent of global defense spending, 43 percent, almost half of the world's defense spending is spent right here in the U.S. We are defending the U.S. And we're not just defending the U.S. We are defending much of the rest of the world. We don't hear about that from the critics of the size of government. We need to talk about the government spending almost 20 percent of its total budget on defense, it spending much less on innovation, education, infrastructure, failing infrastructure. Now, let me just get to a couple facts about the size of government comparatively speaking, because you might say, God, the U.S. government's so big. U.S. government as a share of GDP has really not changed very much in the last 20 years. Actually, I heard the applause for Ronald Reagan, President Reagan. Government spending under his term actually rose to about almost 24.5 percent of GDP. It fell under President Clinton and under President George W. Bush. So, presidents do have different ways of handling this. But the point is the U.S. has been spending in the past 20 years about 20 percent. The government has not gotten bigger. And by the way, government spending as a share of GDP or government tax revenues as a share of GDP, if you look at the most competitive nations in the world, and you line up the U.S., you will see that the U.S. is one of the most competitive nations in the world. But -- there are many other nations that do as well as the U.S., but they do it with much higher levels of government spending and taxes as a share of their GDP. They're innovative, they have spirit. They're competitive. They're growing rapidly. Their governments are a whole lot bigger. I see I'm running out of time, so let me say the final thing because I think this is very important to think about. I'll bring this up in my comments. I started with the view that the government is us. The biggest area of growth in the U.S. government is entitlement spending. Entitlement spending is Social Security and Medicare. "

    "data":"The first thing I have to do is lower this microphone a little bit. You're pretty tall, Phil, but -- and in the other sense, I'll keep my comments short, if you know what I mean. Now, you told me I had to start off with a little light something or other. And I was talking to my granddaughter, Maggie Rembert, about saying something light, and I didn't really know what to say. And she said, Papa, you can always tell them about the invisible man who married the invisible woman. The kids weren't much to look at either. Let me, if I can -- I'm going to stick with -- sorry. Let me just start with -- I'm going to let Phil's facts speak for themselves. And I agree with them whole-heartedly on the road to prosperity. I want to just say -- and again I want to agree with Laura that it's not partisan. It's not Republican. It's not Democrat. It's not liberal. It's not conservative. It's not left wing, it's not right wing. It's economics. And that's where we really are. And it's really not partisan ideology. It's plain business. And if you look at today's economy -- and I do want to look at today's economy -- when you look at what the government has done and is doing, I think they truly are stifling the American spirit today. It reminds me very much of what happened in the 1930s when you got that, whenever people make decisions -- whenever people make decisions when they're either panicked or drunk the consequences are rarely attractive. We have had a panic decision here in the United States, and I believe it was wrong. I believe the government intervened dramatically when they should not have. They should have had a brown paper bag and gotten the feelings out of them. They should not have moved. But they did. We had TARP. We had the interventions there, the stimulus packages. They don't work. Now, what Laura is correct about is that they sure worked for the beneficiaries of the stimulus programs. That's true. The transfer recipients were stimulated, and they did spend more. No question about it. But the people from whom the resources were taken, they spent less. And as we all know in economics, and if you go to the Slutsky Equations in an economy, the income effects always sum to zero, bingo. While the transfer recipients are stimulated, the transfer payers are de-stimulated, and there is no net stimulus from these packages purely. Now, the substitution effects aggregate. And what has happened is we've led the huge deficits, huge tax rates, and output employment production. I mean, let me just take you through quickly what they did in the Great Depression. I mean, 1929, we passed Smoot-Hawley Tariff, the largest tax on traded products in the world. Then in 1930 it was signed into law, you got the crash in the markets. 1932, under a Republican president, they raised the highest marginal tax rate in the U.S., from 25 percent to 63 percent. Now, wasn't that smart? By the way, I'm not mentioning any of the others, inheritance tax, the gift taxes, you know, all these other taxes, excise, et cetera. 1936, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a Democrat this time, they raised the highest marginal tax rate from 63 percent to 79 percent and then on up the next year to 81 percent. You wonder why it was the longest deepest depression in U.S. history, that's why. I mean, they raised the estate tax up to 90 percent. I mean, it's amazing what happened there. What you're seeing today in the United States is an exact pattern following that. When interventionist people get going, you can't stop it, and that is precisely what's happening in the U.S. In part it's because of the agency problem, and the agency problem is very simply that the people in government don't bear the consequences of their own actions. They are not compensated for their success or their failures. They're compensated. It's very different than what happens in the private sector. And that's why you get a misbehavior there. Just on the stimulus, let me just try it, if something doesn't work in a two-person economy, it's not good economics. Take two farmers, that's the whole world. If one of those farmers gets unemployment benefits, guess who pays for it? The other farmer. You know, it is -- there is no tooth fairy in government. There is no -- you know, there is no Father Christmas working on the Treasury staff. My colleague, Milton Friedman, was correct when he said, There ain't no such thing as a free lunch. If you look at tax rates on the upper income groups, anyone who looks at these data from the statistics of income, these people know how to get around taxes. If you raise their tax rates, they shift their income, they shift the location of their income, they shift the timing of their income, they shift the volume of their income, and they pay less in taxes. The only group that consistently pays less when you raise their tax rates and more when you lower them are the top one percent of income earners. That is literally what happens. Again, just to finish my comments, and I'm going to finish my comments early if I can, John, but I don't want to go way over your head on this, but if you tax people who work and you pay people who don't, do I need to say the next sentence to you? Help me, if you tax rich people, and you give the money to poor people, you're going to get lots and lots of poor people and no rich people. The dream in America has always been to make the poor rich, not to make the rich -- the rich poor. I mean, if I can quote John F. Kennedy here, and I'm a Kennedy Democrat from the '60s, I've worked with Democrats as much or more -- I mean, I started with Phil Gramm, can you believe that? When he was a Democrat. But, you know, Kennedy put it beautifully when he said, The best form of welfare is still a good high paying job. I mean, Benjamin Hooks I thought did it wonderfully when he said that “Blacks are hired last, and they're fired first. The only way we're ever going to get jobs and keep them is there's so darn many jobs around they got to hire us. I want to tell you very seriously, there is only one solution to the economic problem that we're facing, that's economic growth, and to get that economic growth you've got to realign incentives both in government and in the private sector to make sure that you produce the way you should in this country. And with that I'd like to say thank you to the groups that are putting on this debate. You guys are all wonderful. Thank you. "

    "data":"Good evening, everyone. It's great being here on this NYU stage. I'm a professor at NYU, so great being here at home. Is big government stifling the American spirit? My answer is no. You heard the Gramm and Laffer bashing the government. They’re the two high priests of supply-side economics, what is also referred to as voodoo economics. Actually the term voodoo economics was first used by George Bush when he was campaigning against Reagan during the 1980 presidential campaign. It’s a religion because it’s based not on facts or science but on faith. They have ten commandments. Big government and most government spending are always wasteful and stifles the American spirit, first. Second, free markets always know best, they never fail, they never experience a national crisis. Three, it’s best to have no regulation or supervision of markets, especially financial markets. Four, high taxes are bad especially for the rich and the very rich. Five, lowering tax rates increases revenues overall, the Laffer Curve doesn’t work. Even if lower taxes lead to higher deficits, higher deficits don’t matter. Seven, even if lower tax rates cause higher deficits, that’s good because you’ve got to starve the beast, you’ve got to force the government to cut back its own size. That doesn’t work either. Eight, government spending is always wasteful unless it’s for foreign wars that cost trillions of dollars. Nine, subsidies are bad but subsidies and tax breaks for big business are always good even if they bust the budget. Ten, income and wealth inequality are good; as Gordon Gekko said, greed is good. In capitalism it is the survival of the fittest or the richest. Big government should have nothing to do with income inequality. Now these are the principles, but with a bunch of experiments in the ’80s and the last ten years which means 2001 to 2008 during the Bush administration -- we had the system of free markets and laissez-faire economics, no regulation, supervision of the financial system, lower tax rates and supply-side voodoo economics and a rhetoric of bashing big government while increasingly spending on government spending, discretionary spending and on the military. What did we end up with? We ended up with the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression, two expensive foreign wars financed with two trillion dollars worth of debt, with budget deficits that were already over a trillion dollars when Obama became president. So who bailed out Bear Stearns, Fannie and Freddie, AIG, Citi, Goldman-Sachs, an entire financial system with 700 billion TARP money? Was it the Democrats? No, it was during the Bush administration. So who are the culprits of this economic, fiscal, and financial mess? Is it big government? No. The culprits are here, by the way, two of them are here, Mr. Laffer, Mr. Gramm. And I mean it literally. Paul Krugman listed Mr. Gramm as the number two person responsible for the economic crisis after Alan Greenspan. If you believe that Krugman is biased, both CNN and Time Magazine put them in the list of the top 20 people to blame for the financial crisis. What his record is is he has been bashing big government forever, for decades, but he was a leading author by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that essentially repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, that led to what is called the CitiGroup Relief Act, that led to the merger, the disastrous merger, of CitiCorp and the Travelers group. Now they’re under government control, these financial institutions. And as we know, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act was one of the many causes of the recent financial crisis.  Gramm was also one of the five co-sponsors of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 that essentially limited any regulation of credit derivatives and other derivatives, with even an Enron loop hole in it that essentially limited any regulation of energy futures. You know what ended up happening with Enron. It went to a scandal and bankruptcy. Other parts of this act limited regulation and supervision of credit derivatives, of CDSs [spelled phonetically] and other [unintelligible] derivatives as well at the center of this financial crisis. Warren Buffet calls these derivatives weapons of mass destruction. So that’s the record. Does he think he’s responsible for some of the financial crisis? Not only doesn’t he, but in a July 2008 interview, when he was advisor to McCain, he said that the nation was not even in a recession. He said, you’ve heard of mental depression. This is a mental recession. We’ve sort of become a nation of whiners. You just hear the constant whining, complaining about the loss of competitiveness, American decline. During this mental recession, 8.5 million people lost their jobs, unemployment went to 10 percent, 17 percent including discouraged workers or partially-employed workers. And of course Mr. Gramm and Mr. Laffer believe that giving unemployment benefits because of loss of jobs and income is bad because it reduces the incentive to find new work. Now what’s the record instead of Mr. Laffer? He is the father of the Laffer Curve, the idea that if you lower tax rates, revenue is eventually going to be become higher. Now, there is zero, zero evidence that tax rates pay for themselves. I could cite hundreds of economic studies, but I will cite just one person, Greg Mankiw, who was the main economic advisor of George Bush, W. He is also a professor at Harvard. He said the following thing about the idea of a Laffer Curve working, in a part of his textbook called Charlatans and Cranks. “When politicians rely on the advice of charlatans and cranks, they rarely get the desirable results they anticipate. After Reagan's election, Congress passed the cut in tax rates that Reagan advocated. But the tax cut did not cause tax revenue to rise.” And I could cite hundreds of other studies suggesting that there is absolutely no evidence that reducing tax rates increases revenues. David Stockman, who was the budget director for Reagan, most recently in an op-ed in the New York Times titled “How My Republican Party Destroyed the American Economy.” And he started his op-ed by saying, “If there was such a thing as a chapter 11 for politicians, the Republican push to extend unaffordable Bush tax cuts would amount to bankruptcy filing. That's the lesson.” Now, we realize that tax cuts do not reduce budget deficits. They increase them sharply. So they change the argument in favor of tax cuts. They realize that tax cuts are [unintelligible] to budget deficit. But they say, first of all, it doesn't matter. Or if does matter, it's going to starve the beast. To have low tax rates is going to force the government to cut government spending. That was the argument. The result was just the opposite. When Bush came to power in 2001, discretionary spending was 260 billion at that time. By the time he left the administration eight years later, it was 420 billion, twice as much. "

    "data":"Well thank you very much indeed, ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great pleasure to be here with you tonight, nothing would be easier, than to blame everything on the bankers. Think of Richard Fuld…of Lehman Brothers. In 2007 his compensation, for the year, was $72 million. The year before his firm collapsed. Never to be seen again. Or James Cayne of Bear Stearns who made $290 million, in the nine years before his firm vanished without trace. Not only were the bankers greedy, we would agree. They were also, in many cases, incompetent. But I and my colleagues are not here to praise them, or to defend them. We blame them for much of what has gone wrong. It’s just that we blame the politicians…more. We’ve already heard quoted tonight that wonderful saying of Chuck Prince, as long as the music is playing you have to get up and dance but you have to ask yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, who was playing the music. You know, it’s so easy, to heap opprobrium on Wall Street right now. It’s just too easy. And if you noticed, that’s exactly what the politicians do. I couldn’t help but notice, in President Obama’s inaugural address, an allusion to greed, and irresponsibility. And only yesterday, he was denouncing, and I quote, “The recklessness and greed of the bonuses paid to executives at the insurance company AIG.” It was just the same in the last Great Depression, I think of this as the Slight Depression. FDR in his inaugural address, heaped scorn on the rulers of the exchange and the unscrupulous money-changers. Ladies and gentlemen, you have to ask yourselves…why do the politicians always wax so indignant about finance at times like these? Could it just possibly be that they’re trying to divert our attention away from Washington’s own responsibility for the debacle? What I want to do in the brief time I have available is to invite you to consider the roles played by four institutions, in bringing about this financial crisis, and I also want you to reflect on the location of those institutions. The first is the Federal Reserve Board. Its role has been to allow a housing bubble to inflate, and burst, between January of 2001 and June of 2003, the Fed cut its federal funds rate from 6.5 percent to 1 percent. Then over three years it very gradually, by quarterpoints, raised rates up to 5.25 percent. In that time, ladies and gentlemen, house price inflation in this country, rose from 7 percent, to 17 percent a year, and it stayed above 15 percent a year, right until January of 2006. This was the period when Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Fed, proclaimed the advent of a great moderation, in economic life, yes, that was the title of his lecture in 2004. “Some moderation.” The location of the Federal Reserve Board, is the Eccles Building, Constitution Avenue, Washington D.C. The second institution, that I’d like to draw your attention to is the Securities and Exchange Commission, which under Christopher Cox, allowed the leverage in the banking system to spiral out of all control, from some 12 to 1, to as we’ve already heard this evening somewhere in the region of 20 to 30 to 1, in the case of the big investment banks. And that was a conscious decision by the SEC. The location of the SEC, ladies and gentlemen, 100 F Street Northwest, Washington, D.C. My third prime suspect is Congress, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, Congress because it was Congress that wholly failed to supervise Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. Those two essential institutions, which underpin the United States mortgage market. On the eve of their destruction, Fannie and Freddie had core capital, as defined by their regulator, of $83 billion, and supported around $5.2 trillion of debt and guarantees. In other words they were leveraged 65-to-1. The location of the Congress, I’m sure you’re aware of this but I can’t help but point it out, is Capitol Hill, Washington D.C. And that brings me to another nearby location—the location of the White House. You know the White House played an extremely important role in creating the sub-prime mortgage disaster. “We want everybody in America to own their own home,” declared President George W. Bush, in October in 2002. Everybody, in America. He challenged lenders to create 5.5 million new minority homeowners, by the end of the decade. He signed the American Dream Down Payment Act, in 2003. No Presidential pressure, no sub-prime debacle. The address of the White House, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, Washington D.C. Well, ladies and gentlemen, bankers are nearly always actuated by greed, so, I’m sad to say, are many ordinary people too. But it’s the role of government to strike a balance, between market forces, and stability. And I move in conclusion, that we should blame Washington more than Wall Street, for this crisis. Not least because in my view, Washington sold itself to Wall Street. And I very much fear, is still in hock to it. I beg to propose this motion."

    "data":"Thank you, I hope you can all hear me, I see a lot of green out there tonight, which is fitting on two levels. It’s also St. Patrick’s Day, another festival of wretched excess that will lead to some hangovers tomorrow. And I have to say I’m at a great disadvantage because, Niall Ferguson has that accent, he could read the phone book to you and it would sound a lot smarter than I do. But before I get going I want to quickly address something that Niall said— Niall was talking a lot about institutions that were involved with residential home finance. And there’s no doubt that mortgages, residential mortgages are a huge part of this crisis. But the two banks that have collapsed in the last year, the two Wall Street banks that have effectively collapsed in the last year, Lehman and Bear, really weren’t all that involved in the residential mortgage finance business, they— Not to say they weren’t involved but they weren’t as involved as a lot of other people. And the reason I point that out is because, the issues here, are a lot larger than Fannie and Freddie or the home price bubble, as significant as that is.So let me, let me start by going back to the resolution which, the resolution doesn’t say, we need more regulation going forward, I don’t think anyone on this panel, anyone in this room would disagree with that. And the resolution doesn’t say that bankers should all be put on a desert island and forced to make their own society. You know, I guess that’s the Hamptons but— Sorry, Jim. But— But what the resolution says is, “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis.” And that is flat wrong. And to understand why, like Niall, I wanna take you back to the Depression, and to the creation of the SEC. Now, the Depression was the last time that there was this kind of public anger at Wall Street and at big business in the United States, and understandably so. And when the Roosevelt administration created the SEC, one of the things that they considered doing, briefly, was having the SEC have the power to prevent companies from selling shares, not because they were committing fraud or misrepresenting their financial statements, but simply because the SEC’s economic experts would find, well, this company doesn’t have very good prospects. This company has too much competition. We’re not gonna let them sell shares. And that idea didn’t go very far, it was very rapidly rejected, but it was considered. But what—why I think this is so important and interesting is it shows that even during the Depression, even during a time when unemployment was 25 percent and there were breadlines and there was really a question about whether capitalism could work, and there—you know, there was an alternative model that seemed to be working in the Soviet Union— Even then the United States went with a relatively permissive, regulatory regime. And that’s always been our history. And to me, that makes sense, and if you think about your own life, if you think about your own business as you know, whether you’re a lawyer or a doctor or whether you work in retail, whether you—a landlord, whatever it is that you may do, you probably have a better idea where the opportunities are, but also where the problems are, where you can take advantage of your customers, where you can cut corners, than any regulator could no matter closely they monitored you. It’s your business, it’s your life. And so the regulator needs to set the rules, but in the end—you succeed or fail on your own. And think about the commercial airline industry in the United States, which is really a great success story in the most important way which is that it’s extremely safe. You can count the number of jet crashes this decade on one hand, in the United States. And, you know, we’re going towards zero. And I don’t think that’s because the FAA is a better regulator than the FDA or the SEC, or anyone else, I think it’s because there’s a commitment in the airline industry to safety. Now whether they define that as a moral issue, we need to protect our passengers and our workers, or whether it’s a practical issue where they believe there might not be economic repercussions, people might not wanna fly if there were too many crashes, I don’t know. But there’s no question that the airline industry in the United States is extremely safe. And I think it’s not a result of the FAA, I think it’s a result of a commitment within the industry. Compare that to Wall Street, which appears to have been run by a bunch of greedy children, for the last 10 years. And greed is a crucial word there, because although Niall sort of—you know, he mentioned the compensation and then skated past it. Compensation is a crucial, crucial part of understanding what went wrong on Wall Street in the last 10 years. When you can make a million or 10 million or in some cases $100 million for a year’s work, you don’t have very much incentive to run your business for the long term. If you can…if theoretically, you’re being paid in stock, and your compensation is gonna be restricted over a long time, you have more incentive. But even so if the numbers are really, really large, it’s unlikely that you’re going to think long-term. And so I think Jim now will talk to you about some of the specifics of what went wrong on Wall Street in the last 10 years. But, at its core, the issue is relatively simple, there was a huge amount of leverage taken, there was inadequate capital to support the risks that the banks were taking. When you make loans, some of them are gonna go bad, and you need to have enough money in capital, in equity, to handle those losses, and the banks simply didn’t have that. Now, did Washington create the conditions that allowed that to happen, sure. Could we and should we have had a much more robust regulatory system? Absolutely. Regulation is vital, regulation sets the playing field, it sets the rules. But in the end, you have to put blame where blame is due. And, blame is due on the firms. It’s due on the owners, it’s due on the managers, it’s due on the executives, it’s due on the employees. To some extent, although to a lesser extent it’s due on shareholders because the shareholders didn’t properly manage the boards of directors but that’s something Nell can talk about. But in the end, blame accrues to Wall Street, not Washington, please keep that in mind, and vote against this resolution. Thank you."

    "data":"The British always wanna file me under Steele-Gordon, with a hyphen. I only use my middle name because John Gordon is about as blah a name as you can find. I’m here to argue that Washington is more at fault than Wall Street, although as everybody has admitted, Wall Street has plenty of blame to take here. But…Wall Street is not unitary. Wall Street is nothing but a metonym for the American financial market, and it operates around the globe and…nowadays, deep down into the socioeconomic spectrum. Now some of the people who are encompassed by the term “Wall Street” have fiduciary obligations to their stockholders or to their depositors. But the majority of, of Wall Streeters do not. They are operating entirely for themselves in their self-interest. Washington on the other hand, has nothing but fiduciaries, I mean that’s why governments are instituted among men, no other reason. Now, Wall Street because it is entirely inhabited by people who are pursuing their self-interest, it’s notorious that there are only two emotions to be found on Wall Street, fear and greed. Right now I think it’s perhaps time to put in a good word for greed. As a result, we have had panics on Wall Street roughly every 20 years. Now the Constitution came into effect in April of 1789, we had the first crash on Wall Street in April of 1792. Then we had another one 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893, 1907, 1929, 1987, and now 2008. It seems to be just part of the beast, I mean could any of these panics have been prevented by Wall Street? I doubt it. Being individuals, and Wall Street is nothing but a collection of individuals, not an institution, it is inherently susceptible to the madness of crowds. So, blaming Wall Street is like blaming the atmosphere for thunderstorms, it’s the nature of the beast, it’s going to happen. Washington on the other hand is supposed to be the guys with the striped shirts and the whistles on the playing field. They make up the rules, and then they enforce them. And then they sometimes change the rules in order to accommodate some of their friends.Also Alan Greenspan famously said, that it is—part of the Federal Reserve’s job is to take away the punchbowl when the party really gets going. In other words it’s Washington’s job to prevent the crowd from going mad. They’ve just done an incredibly lousy job of regulating Wall Street or preventing the madness of crowds. I mean for one thing the regulatory apparatus is a total shambles. I mean we have the Federal Reserve, we have the Controller of the Currency, we have the SEC, we have the Office of Thrift Supervision. We have the FDIC. We have the banking regulatory authorities of the 50 states. All of them bureaucracies, all of them devoted as all bureaucrats are to protecting turf, far and head of, of actually regulating anything. Now, also, politicians are subject to human nature, the same as Wall Streets [sic] are. If Wall Streeters are in the business of making money, politicians are in the reelection business. That means that they’re gonna be short term-oriented, they’re gonna—what they want is the good headline tomorrow morning, and if that produces dreadful policy two or three or five years out, that’s after the election, we’ll worry about it then. Everybody knows that publicly-traded corporations have to submit annual reports, that these reports have to be according to standardized accounting rules, and that they have to be certified as being honest and complete by independent accountants. This is a great idea. It’s now so obvious that nobody even thinks about it anymore, but it was invented by Wall Street. Because the great Wall Street banks in the late 19th century, they wanted to know what the corporations were really up to, and so did the members of the New York Stock Exchange. So the corporation screamed bloody murder at first, but the Wall Street banks said sorry, if you want us to underwrite your securities, you’re gonna have to do this, and the New York Stock Exchange says if you want your securities listed with us, you’re gonna have to do it, so they finally did it. There’s still one great big player in the financial world in the United States, that is not subject to these commonsense rules. It’s called the government. For instance, you remember those budget surpluses in the later years of the Clinton administration between 1998 and 2001? They amounted to $558 billion. So the national debt went down by $558 billion, right? Uh, no, it went up by $400 billion. The reason is that Social Security was put on budget. And that means that the revenues that flow into Social Security over and above what is paid out to recipients of Social Security becomes part of the government revenue, it’s called an intra-governmental transfer. Of course the money that’s taken out of the Social Security trust fund is replaced with newly minted federal bonds. Which is why the debt went up. Now, if a private company or publicly-traded company, tried to take employee contributions to the company pension fund, and call it revenue in order to perk up the bottom line, the managers of that corporation would all this very minute be playing volleyball in Club Fed. Or, consider Fannie and Freddie. It was a great—Fannie was a great idea, it sounded, in 1938--and it really, it liquefied the mortgage market, it helped, along with the GI Bill tremendously, to increase home ownership, and I’m gonna have to quit here I’m afraid."

    "data":"Thank you, John, and thank you to Robert and to Intelligence Squared for putting on this great series and heightening the  public debate on these important issues. I think you’re doing great, great work, thank you. Now, we’ve heard from two-thirds of the  for” team’s members, and from my august teammate, Mr. Berenson. And, we all seem to be missing sight of the resolution. Again, no one seems to disagree that more regulation is needed. No one seems to disagree, that crimes, malfeasance, and incompetence, were at work. The question is who’s more to blame. And I hope to be able to make my point, that in fact that’s gonna be pretty easy to point out. Before I got here I was searching the web for instances of Irish wit when it comes to financial markets and money. Now my mother was Mary Catherine Sullivan, and as much as I—I tried hard to find examples of that wit, I came a cropper. So I had to turn to another great philosopher, in all matters economic. Tony Soprano. Who went imploring his gang to work harder, ‘cause not enough money was coming in to keep everybody happy, said  Look, we don’t got one of them Enron things here.” This is important. Because, I would like to go on to tell you that agency risk as it exists in corporate America is legion. It is endemic, and it is pervasive. In 1998 Business Week put out a survey, after, canvassing 500 of the S&P 500 Chief Financial Officers anonymously. And they were asked in the celebrated question,  How many of you have ever been asked by your superior to materially falsify financial results.” And the answer was stunning. 45 percent said they were asked to do so but didn’t, 12 percent said they were asked to do, and did, and 33 percent said they were never asked. So at the time, 10 years ago, two thirds of our nation’s largest CFO’s had basically been asked to cook the books. And luckily, only a minority did so. And lest you think this was an outlier, the same survey roughly, was repeated by CFO magazine six months later, and had very, very similar results. It’s the main reason I have a business that I feel will continue to prosper no matter what the markets do. Because quite frankly out there, there’s a lotta people in the public markets that wanna take your money. And that, ladies and gentleman, is a point I think that we are going to carry tonight. How did we get, in the last five years, when things seemed to escalate so much, so much worse on the fraud side, from Enron, Tyco and rogue analysts, to the world of Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, Bernie Madoff, and Stanford Financial. Well…I think the reason we have, is that those in charge, yes, they may have fallen asleep. Yes, they may have done dereliction of duty. But we saw a level of compensation, and a new structure of structured finance that allowed, as Alex pointed out, undreamed-of amounts of leverage, and skewed incentives for compensation. It was heads I win, tails, my shareholders lose. Every trading desk had a mantra of making their numbers in one way, shape, form or another, and did so quite easily in all kinds of markets in the last five to 10 years, up, down, whatever. It was not just Madoff who produced stunning consistent and profitable results. If you look at the profits as Bob Rosenkranz alluded to in his opening statement, of our largest banks and brokers, no matter what the markets did, many of these firms returned 20 to 30 percent on equity, quarter in, quarter out, with very little variability of operations. How did that happen. Well, they were gaming the system. Remember Sarbanes-Oxley? I do, I got all kinds of phone calls from the press after Sarbanes-Oxley saying well you don’t have a job anymore. Short selling will never be profitable. Yes, corporate malfeasance will be a thing of the past. Because CEO’s and CFO’s now have to sign the financial statements. And if something goes wrong, they could go to jail. And when I pointed out to those same journalists that falsifying financial statements has always been a crime, and this jus simply codified it a little tighter. Well, this is post- Enron, people are going to be vigilant, and accountants and lawyers will not let this happen. Ladies and gentlemen, I will pose to you that there has not been one major financial fraud in the past 25 years, uncovered by the government, outside auditors, or outside counsel. It’s always been journalists, whistle-blowers, or short sellers, or some combination thereof. Daresay, that if Bernie Madoff had been public, the shorts would’ve found him out a long time ago. Now, post- Sarbanes-Oxley, post-Enron, we had to move to tougher accounting standards. We saw FAZ 46 get brought in, and I’m not gonna bog you down in arcane but it basically said, keeping things off the balance sheet is no longer kosher. Part of the problem with Enron as you recall were the funds that were offshore that an Enron CFO was general partner of while he was still undertaking his duties as Enron CFO. Well, guess who lobbied for a big exemption, of those rules. The banks and brokers, who got FIN 46-R enacted which was, financial institutions were exempt, from the consolidation of offshore entities and unconsolidated entities, hiding large amounts of assets and liabilities. Imagine that. And while we’re at it let’s talk about Professor Ferguson’s locus of problems. Well the Fed, yeah, the Fed’s located in Washington, there’s no doubt about that. But the part of the Fed that is instructed to be the market cop, is the New York Fed. Now the New York Fed for the past few years was run by the current Treasury secretary. But do you know who sits on the board of the New York Fed and do you know who it answers to. Bet very few of you do. The largest commercial banks in the United States."

    "data":"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I say the beginning [sic] I support the proposition, I blame more Washington, than Wall  Street for this financial crisis, but I should say the beginning, that I do agree that Wall Streeters, bankers, traders, investors, are greedy. Sometimes they are stupid, they are arrogant, they’re incompetent. They take too much risk, they take too much leverage, they are over compensated, all that’s true. But we’ve had the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, we have to ask ourselves, are bankers and investors more greedy and more immoral than they were 20 years ago. 20 years ago, Gordon Gekko in Wall Street said that greed is good. I don’t think that has changed, you know, we know there is always greed, actually greed in some sense is good, is one of the drivers of capitalism. But we know that greed has to be controlled by three things. By fear of losses, by the fact they should not expect to be bailed out, and by a system of prudential regulation and supervision of the financial system because financial markets without ruling institutions are like the law of the jungle. And that’s to me the failure, I expect Wall Street to be greedy but I expect good policy-making, trying to control the behavior, and that did not happen. In many dimensions. The Fed and Greenspan, after the last tech bubble went bust, cut interest rates almost to zero, and created the asset bubble, kept interest rates too low for too long. Was most at that time, people talked about the Greenspan put [sic] in financial markets, it was the expectation whenever trouble occurs, Greenspan’s gonna ease things and get you out of your losses and problems. It happened after the 1987 stock market crash and the S&L crisis easing, then in the ‘90s with the tech bubble, Greenspan warned about irrational exuberance and did nothing about it. And after the tech bubble went bust, he cut interest rates from 6.5 down to 1 percent, and he created the latest bubble. So, he has been a creator of serial bubbles one after the other and when people expect to be bailed out then they behave accordingly, that’s the Greenspan truth. We created a system which people expect, that the gains are going to be privatized, and the losses are going to be socialized; this is a welfare state for the rich, for the well-connected and for Wall Street. That’s what happened, that’s public policy. The action of the Fed regarding the asset bubble, was, you don’t do anything on the way up, that was the official rule of Greenspan, Don Kohn, and Ben Bernanke, and when the asset bubble collapses, to avoid the collateral damage to the real economy, you ease aggressively. Again, that’s a buyer’s behavior that creates more and more bubbles. We’re running out of bubbles actually to create, with the real estate bubble, the tech bubble, the hedge fund bubble, the private equity bubble, you know, even the commodity bubble, the art bubble, we’re running out of bubbles to create but we’re easing again down to zero so, what’s gonna happen this time around. As was pointed out, the job of the Fed is to take away the punchbowl when the party gets going but unfortunately not only the Fed did not take away the punchbowl, it added vodka, whiskey, gin, and every toxic stuff to it. And it made the bubble even bigger. Take the role of the Fed and the regulators, with sub-prime mortgages…Greenspan was the biggest cheerleader of this kind of financial innovation. Zero down payment, no verification of income, assets and jobs, they called them ninja loans or liar loans. Interest-only mortgages, negative amortization, teaser rates, all this toxic stuff or subprime, near-prime, prime. The Fed and Greenspan actively said was the best thing that have happened to mortgages. Free market, they could control it, they had the law, the power to do it, they didn’t do it. Think about our public policy towards housing and mortgages. The Community Reinvestment Act, creation of Fannie and Freddie-subsidized housing. The 20 ways in which we have subsidized, through tax policy, interested community of mortgages. The worst, and the most unproductive form of investment, investment in housing. Big McMansion can give you utility but doesn’t increase the stock of capital in the real way of productivity of capital and labor, like, physical capital does. We have subsidized housing in 20 different ways. That has led to the bubble as well. There was an ideology for the last decade in Washington, that was critical to this financial crisis. Was an ideology of laissez-faire, Wild West unregulated capitalists. The base of this ideology was the idea that banks and financial institutions will self-regulate. And as we know, self-regulation means no regulation. It was the ideology of relying on market discipline, and we know when there is irrational exuberance, there is zero market discipline. There was an ideology, and policies of relying on an internal risk management model and as was pointed out, Chuck Prince said, when the music is playing you gotta stand up and dance, nobody listens in good times to the risk managers, they’re the party poopers, only the risk takers have the advantage in the banks, and therefore, relying on internal risk management doesn’t work. Was relying on rating agencies that had massive conflicts of interest because of being paid by those they are supposed to be rating. And this rating agency had a quasi-governmental role. They had monopoly or oligopoly power, and power to decide whose assets you can buy or not buy, that was policy that led them to have that power, and those kind of distortions. So every element of our regulatory system, has failed, you know, this Basel accord that relied on this principle, has failed even before it was implemented. Relying on principle rather than rules, relying on light touch, rather than tough rules, a light touch means no touch at all. The ideology of Greenspan was, every financial innovation is great, markets self-regulate. Shareholders are gonna be able to control the behavior of bankers and so on. This was the belief in deregulation. Elements of it, actions were taken. The repeal of Glass-Steagall that separated investment banking from commercial banking. Now we let them essentially, use deposit insurance and deposits to do 30 times leverage prop trading, that’s what was allowed. Essentially deregulation of credit derivatives and derivatives, over the counter with systemic risk. Things of that sort were going on. The SEC deciding the level ratios, 30 to 1 was okay. Those were the policy that led then to those excesses. There is greed, it is up to public policy to make sure that greed is controlled because otherwise if you don’t have rules, institutions, and balance and prudential regulation supervision, is the law of the jungle, and unfortunately the last element of it was regulatory capture. It was an ideology in which, the government power taken over and controlled by lobbies where those were pushing for this kind of deregulation. So it was a massive failure of public policy, thank you."

    "data":"Only when they deserve it.  You’ve got to vote for our side. I have to tell you, you know, there’s plenty of blame to go around, we all agree, there’s plenty of blame to go around. You know, there’s Washington, there’s Wall Street, but all of us know who really is to blame here, it’s gotta be Jim Cramer. Listen, I’m willing to blame everybody, I’m even willing to blame that Bachelor guy, I— everybody, everybody deserves— it takes a village to create this problem. Or put it another way I’m gonna quote Pogo, who said,  We have met the enemy and he is us,” every one of us bears some responsibility for what went on here but I’m gonna tell you today, why it’s Wall Street that is primarily responsible. First of all, it’s a bit of a false distinction, between Wall Street and Washington. And one of the things I’m going to talk about today is how inextricably they are linked. We talk about Fannie and Freddie. Those were public corporations, after all. They were a little bit the better, the worst of both worlds, a little bit of a duck billed platypus because they had a little government edge there. But those were public corporations with Boards of Directors and they behaved like public corporations. They behaved badly. And that is what is wrong with Wall Street. So you may noticed already, even in this few minutes that I’ve been up here, I’m different. I’m not like anybody else on this panel and that is why, and the primary difference, as I’m sure you’ve noticed, is I’m the only one on the panel who is from Washington. I have to say, none of these people know anything about Washington except some addresses. That’s all we know. I see he’s got a GPS, is all he’s got. And you know, and the other thing is, I’m not an economist. I am a capitalist. I, uniquely on this panel, I have created businesses. I have created businesses, had them grow and sold them. I have worried about making a payroll. So I know something. I’m not like an economist who, it works in theory, it doesn’t work in practice. So I know what it is to be a capitalist. And I know what it is to be a bureaucrat. I worked in the government. In the Reagan administration I was at OMB. And let me tell you, one of the big shocks in my life was all these people who espouse and rhapsodize about the free market kept trooping over to me to get me to give them limits on liability and erect barriers to entry. Everybody is all about the free market except when it benefits them not to be. So I’m going to tell you the three things that Wall Street did that are unforgivable and that really weigh the balance in favor of their responsibility. What is the one thing we want from Wall Street? We want just one thing. We want them to be able to do math, right? The math was wrong. Their math was bad. They put too much reliance on something called the Gaussian copula formula. Yes, the Gaussian copula formula is at the heart of what created the derivative securities, the credit default swaps. They all relied on it. They all got on one leaky little boat. They didn’t take out their slide rules. They didn’t do the math. So they relied on bad statistics. They left out one big variable. Yes, they heard music, but what dance were they doing? They heard music for the minuet. They were doing the boogie, okay? And what is the address of all of those forms? I believe it’s on Wall Street. Second thing, bad incentives. They were getting paid based on the quantity of transactions, not the quality of transactions. Now, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that’s going to have a very bad result. Look at what we’ve seen about the pay just in the last couple of days. Look at The New York Post with its headline today: AIG Is a P-I-G. These people were getting paid regardless of what happened. You heard about Anthony Mozilo? Six hundred million dollars as he took the stock down seventy-eight per cent and took the economy down with it. Fuld didn’t have to give any of it back. I testified with Fuld before Congress in Washington when they called him in to account. And he said, up until last year the performance was pretty good. So he should be allowed to keep all that money. Only thirteen percent of companies on Wall Street have claw backs, meaning they have to give back the money when the numbers that were reported, that they got their bonuses on, turn out to be wrong. That is on Wall Street. What are they doing now? Watch them carefully. They are repricing their options. That is disgusting. And that is Wall Street. Okay, next. Terrible oversight as shareholders. Yes, the shareholders should have done more. Guess who the big shareholders are? Yeah, they’re on Wall Street. Who was it that was voting in favor of these insane pay packages? Well, look at the firms on Wall Street. They’re the big shareholders. They’re managing all that money. They are enablers for the addiction of bad pay packages on Wall Street. And yeah, Washington behaved badly. Washington behaved very badly. Do you think the fact that from 1998 to 2008 over six hundred million dollars was spent on lobbying to get rid of regulations, like Glass-Steagall, to get rid of capital requirements on banks – do you think maybe that might have had an effect on it? Yeah, Washington is nice to its friends. Who is responsible for that? Who are its friends? I would like Wall Street to make the same disclaimer that is required of mutual funds. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. And who is it that requires them to say that? That is Washington. Wall Street has expected us to bet on them for a long time. They have not lived up to our trust in them and they are more responsible than Washington for this mess. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you. Thank you very much. When Simon Johnson and I speak of breaking up the big banks, we're speaking of less than a dozen banks that are considered, as you mentioned,  too big to fail”. Let me just give you a statistic, 0.2 percent of all the banks in the United States of America control 70 percent of the banking assets of the country.  One of them mentioned earlier by Bob, JPMorgan, has assets that exceed the total assets of 5,400 community banks in this country. Our definition of a bank  too big to fail” is a bank whose bond holders and shareholders and managers and big customers, even their oligarchs, believe themselves exempt from the rules and the consequences that apply to all others. If they screw up they'll be bailed out by you, the people in this audience, the American taxpayers. It happened in 2008, 2010. You know that. And then a law called Dodd-Frank was passed by Congress to prevent it from ever happening again, and yet today these banks are bigger and the power more concentrated than ever. They are just as likely, they may even be more likely to take great risks in search of profits protected by the assumption that failure is an unlikely outcome and that taxpayers will once again come to their rescue. The mechanics to corral them are more politicized than ever. And even worse, Dodd-Frank, the legislation we just referred to, shackled smaller banks with over 13,000 pages of rules and regulations that as of last year we estimated would take 24,180,156 hours every single year to comply with and to implement. This places the smaller banks that wish to compete with the big banks at a tremendous competitive disadvantage. They don't have the resources to hire lawyers and handsome, well-heeled, Brooklyn accented lobbyists like Paul Saltzman to work the regulators. Under the law, the big banks are now designated as systemically important financial institutions. The acronym for that is SIFIs. Now we, at the Dallas Fed and Simon and I would consider the SIFI an acronym for save if failure impending. And actually when you think about it, SIFI sounds like a communicable disease. Something that's transmitted by risky behavior and indeed -- I was waiting for that response. Indeed it was the TBTF or the SIFIs who were, if not the cause of, they were the spreaders of the economic virus that nearly destroyed our economy in 2008-2010. That crisis, we estimate at the Dallas Fed, cost the United States over $15 trillion in output, output we have yet to regain. And if you do your numbers, you'll know that this is $120,000 per every American household. The SIFIs, the  too big to fail,” are a dagger pointed directly at the heart of the American economy. They threaten the well-being of everybody in in audience and everybody listening to this broadcast. So yes, Simon Johnson and I are advocates for breaking up the big banks that are considered  too big to fail”. Our proposal is simple. We suggest that we limit any and all government guarantees to deposit-taking commercial banking operations of these large bank holding companies. We will let them operate their other businesses, but first prevent them by law from using your deposits and the governed guarantees for the safety of those guarantees from underwriting any of their other businesses. Secondly, require anybody who is counterparty to their other business, which contracts with them on a risk transaction to sign a simple declaration that if this declaration fails -- if this transaction fails, we will never, ever be bailed out by the taxpayers of the United States. And, C, subject all those businesses to the regulations that such businesses are subject to when they're not protected by the banking laws that we currently have, that these big bank holding companies enjoy. For example, on derivatives, make sure they're subject to margin requirements, just like individuals are when they borrow money to buy a stock or a bond. And finally, insist on transparency. As Bob pointed out, there's not much transparency. There's a lot of opaqueness, as it's called. The CEOs of these businesses know where their risks are. If you're a sophisticated analyst, there's no way to determine that by looking at their balance sheet. And I would actually defy our noble opponents to tell me why what I've just suggested is an unworkable solution. And Mr. Saltzman and others are very fond of pointing out what they consider to be myths. One is that there is greater banking concentration in Canada than in the United States, greater concentration in France than in the United States. That's great if you like Gordon Lightfoot, or if you're French. Or they will point out that there are other industries that have a greater concentration, for example computers or telecoms, that's true. But these are companies that are not shielded from failure like banks are. They receive no subsidies from the implied guarantees that the government currently provides them, currently provides the bankers to shield them from failure. Winston Churchill once said that in finance everything that is agreeable is unsound, and everything that is sound is disagreeable. I know that what Simon Johnson and I propose is disagreeable to the highly paid lobbyists and spokesmen of the  too big to fail” big banks. But it is the sound thing to do. The big banks, in summary, have taken what I call the immoral high ground. Government policy has led them there, and it has enshrined them. We need to correct this perversion of American capitalism. It may not be the French thing to do, but it's the American thing to do, and I think we should do so. So I ask you to vote yes to the proposition before this house. Let us break up the banks, the big banks that are considered  too big to fail”. Thank you.  "

    "data":"Thank you, John. Seven years after the subprime mortgage crisis, one thing is clear. Many people made serious mistakes; public officials, regulators and, yes, Simon and Richard, large banks. Mistakes that we now know with the benefit of hindsight helped bring about the crisis. But in the three years since the passage of the Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act, there has been an intense focus on strengthening our banking system. There are new rules and supervisory practices that are changing both the culture and the structure of large banks in permanent and transformational ways to ensure that a crisis like the one we experienced never happens again. But my opponents ignore or understate these reforms. Instead, they propose a radical, untested, and practically unworkable experiment that would upend the progress we have made and create a whole host of new systemic crises. My opponents' proposal would forcibly break up the largest big banks by placing an arbitrary cap, a government imposed -- the same government that can't seem to get its act together with respect to the payment of our debt. This unprecedented abuse of government power attempts to address an ill-defined risk with little regard for its practical implications or its unintended consequences, simply because they think smaller banks are inherently safer. That is their underlying assumption. And they are selling you this solution as a risk-free proposition without any cost to society. Yes, we can have all the benefits of large banks, but we don't need the large banks.  I'm afraid, Simon and Richard, you just can't have it both ways. Their solution is naive and nostalgic. Yes, we all yearn for a simpler world. I get it. But when America and the world become less interconnected and simpler, when large and small companies become less global and stop being the mainstay of production, consumer innovation, and choice, then let's have this debate. Look, the strengths of our banking system is its diversity. We need banks of all sizes, shapes and functions. And yes, within that mosaic, some banks are large, quite large. But some of these banks are large for a simple reason. They mirror the size and the scope of the economy that they serve. They are scaled to serve the customers and the companies that voluntarily use their services. Large banks provide a unique set of services. Global distribution channels, innovative technologies that only they can produce because of the economies of size, scope and scale at cheaper prices for American consumers. Some of these benefits are visible, like mobile payment technologies and reward points. Some are very much behind the scenes like fraud protection and massive investment for our global infrastructure, clearance, settlement and payment systems. And large banks spend tens of billions of dollars protecting this critical market infrastructure from dangerous cyber-attacks that small banks could not afford to pay. And some benefits are indeed difficult to quantify, but that doesn't make them any less valuable, like the breadth of services that they provide to smaller banks as correspondents as operational support and corporations large and small that allow for multicurrency channels, trade finance, global cash management and other risk management tools. Look, several realities will be debated tonight, realities which I submit can't reasonably be refuted, although my worthy opponents certainly will attempt to do so. First, we do have to put things in perspective. Some of America's banks are indeed large. But we have to view them relative to the size of our economy and the world economy that we live in. The size of the American banking system is proportional to the economy that it serves. Our banking system as a percentage of our economy is basically the equivalent of South Africa's. In addition, as Richard mentioned -- I know he was appealing to isolationist tendencies there, but the fact of the matter is the degree of concentration in our banking system is in fact less than most developed countries. The largest banks, as a percentage of industry revenue, are in fact less than most other industries with fixed costs, including auto manufacturing computers, pharmaceuticals and wireless telecom. Second, the underlying premise of my opponents' theory is that smaller banks are somehow safer and less complex. That is a faulty assumption that is simply belied by the facts of history. Banking crises are caused by one thing: when too many people buy an overinflated asset, you have what's called a common shock, a common shock associated with too many people buying the same overvalued asset. And when that asset bubble bursts, you have a systemic crisis. My point is, smaller institutions, whether they are banks or hedge funds, can be a source of systemic risk. They have been, and unfortunately, they will be. Breaking up the banks will not prevent a future crisis. And also, they would eliminate the stabilizing impact that large and well diversified banks have during times of inevitable crises. And third, and perhaps an area that we'd love to mix it up during the course of the debate, new laws are in place that weren't in place, including the law that prohibits taxpayer bailouts and eliminates  too big to fail”. And there has been tremendous progress in the pace and substance of regulatory reforms to mitigate the risks to our banking system. To ignore or understate these transformational changes is disingenuous. There isn't a single aspect of a bank's business that hasn't undergone -- been untouched, undergone reform or been untouched by regulatory reform. Banks have twice as much capital as they had before the crisis. Liquidity gaps are closed even in advance of regulation. Bankruptcy road maps, through living wills are in place that make organizations simpler and les s complex. And we have a new bankruptcy process that requires banks to be resolved without taxpayer support. To suggest that these changes are illusory is just simply wrong. They are in place. They are effectively limiting both the likelihood the large banks fail and the impact of that failure if and when it does occur. The answer presented by these risks is not to ignore the benefits that large banks bring to our society, but to continue to focus on improving the macro-prudential regulatory framework, to periodically assess their effectiveness, and to think about where the next crisis is coming from.

    "data":"Thank you very much. And thank you, Paul and Doug, for being willing to come out and argue the big banks' corner this evening. This debate is long overdue. Now, Richard Fisher has laid out for you the case, the economic case, the technical case for breaking up the big banks. And, now, you should take note of what he says. He's the president of the Dallas Fed. He's a man with a great deal of experience in financial markets. He's also a man who has to be, you understand, somewhat careful about certain statements he makes, wouldn't want to move the dollar or anything in a precipitous manner. My job today is to tell you the things that Richard Fisher can't tell you -- because he's too nice a guy and too much of a diplomat. And a lot of these things are about politics, and I want to cover these precisely by responding to what Paul Saltzman has just said on three main dimensions. I want to talk about the magic -- supposed magic of banking. I want to talk about JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in the world. And I want to talk about Dodd-Frank, the legislation; the miracle that Mr. Saltzman says has fixed all our problems. Now, on the first one, on the magic of big banks, have you felt it? Have you seen around you as the banks became bigger the great improvement in custo -- the really interesting point -- and I'm afraid the sleight of hand, and it's a masterful sleight of hand -- in what Mr. Saltzman said is the history. When did the banks in the United States become so big? It wasn't 50 years ago. It wasn't 30 years ago. It's mostly in the last 15 years. Mid-1990s, the largest six banks in the United States had total assets around 15 percent, 1-5 percent of U.S. GDP. They're now over 60 percent of GDP, combined. They're bigger now than they were before the crisis. This is a recent development. All -- everyone in this room, everyone listening and watching at home should have felt the magic if there were any magic for you. There isn't. There's magic, all right, there's magic in compensation. If you run a bigger bank, you get a bigger paycheck. You understand what that's about. There is no magic of size for the consumer, for the broader economy, for the nonfinancial sector. Let's talk about numbers. Let's talk about -- let me talk about JPMorgan Chase. I don't see Jamie Dimon the room. He could speak for himself if he is here. We haven't -- nobody said anything about the numbers, the size. What is the balance sheet -- total balance sheet measured properly? Include all the derivative exposure using international accounting standards. It's a $4 trillion bank. It's about a quarter the size of the U.S. economy. I'm comparing the balance sheet with our annual GDP. That's a big bank. If JPMorgan were on the verge of failure today, a Wednesday, it's an awkward day for banks, though -- I think one of the big lessons actually from the Clearing House simulation was Don't fail on a Tuesday. It's a long way from Tuesday to the weekend. We need to get to the weekend. Do the bailout. Right? It's a Wednesday. It's Wednesday, it's an awkward day, I understand. It's an awkward day. JPMorgan, $4 trillion is going down. It's a hypothetical. Please don't rush to tweet that. It's hypothetical. JPMorgan is about to fail. Who here thinks that the president, secretary to the treasury, chairman of the Federal Reserve would let them go? Let them fail? Take the hit? Go through bankruptcy? Does anyone think JPMorgan could fail just like every other business outside of big banks could fail in America? Could JPMorgan fail? Anyone want to raise their hand? Paul, you can raise your hand if you want. Anyway, Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs was a $1.1 trillion bank when it failed. I'm sorry, was rescued by liquidity loans. I always get those two things mixed up. In September 2008, $1.1 trillion bank. That was up from $250 billion in the mid-1990s when it was one of the best banks in the world, when it provided really good service to individuals and corporate customers. One of the best banks in the world. It became a lot bigger. It became $1.1 trillion. Anyone think Goldman Sachs could fail. No. I see no hands. One hand. Good luck to you, sir.  There is a short seller in every New York audience.  Dodd-Frank, Mr. Saltzman says, Dodd-Frank has solved this problem. Now, I'm a supporter of Dodd-Frank. I think this is important legislation. We had to get some of those reforms done. I worked to help the FDIC, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, with their implementation of some of the plans for how you manage the collapse of these banks. Yes, I'm a member of the systemic advisory committee for the FDIC. It's a great, fun job. I can assure you. We have terrific parties.  And, you know, maybe, maybe it'll work. Maybe the single point of entry, the recapitalization of the holding company, maybe they'll be enough capital. Maybe the Federal Reserve will insist on preparing these banks properly so when the day comes the damage is more to the management who are responsible and to the creditors who should be on the hook, and to their shareholders who took the risk rather than on the rest of us, rather than on the economy, rather than on the taxpayer, rather than on everyone who lost a job. Eight million jobs lost, $15 trillion in output. Dennis Kelleher from Better Markets in the second row has the same numbers from his independent assessment. This is a calamity. Maybe we could avert that danger. Maybe Dodd-Frank will work and all these pieces will come together. I would not bet on that. I do not advise you to bet on it. I advise you not to take risk out of the world. You can't do that. We have no magic bullets. There are no panaceas, but as a matter of responsible action, as a matter of dealing with the problems that confront you, as a matter of reducing the risks that we will face, I urge you today support the motion put forward by Richard Fisher and me, Break up the Big Banks. Thank you very much.  "

    "data":"Thank you. Thank you, John, and thank you all for being here. I have to deviate slightly from my prepared notes here, from the sleight of hand comment. My -- the sleight of hand I noticed is they seem to either not be making the same proposal or they seem not to be clear on what the proposal is. My understanding was this was about breaking up the big banks, which I think most of us here, certainly Paul and I assumed, was to break them into pieces, many pieces, not -- to bring them down below a certain size level, not to do what sounds like a variant of Glass-Steagall. Simon himself didn't describe what he thinks should be done. He described what he doesn't like about the current situation. I'm sure later they'll have a chance to explain what they actually mean and if they both mean the same thing. Taking this the way I think we were supposed to, I strongly believe it would be a big mistake to forcibly break up the largest American banks. I oppose breaking them up for three main reasons. First, as Paul has pointed out, we need some very large complex banks in America to cost effectively help our businesses and families deal with a large, complex world. Without them, loans and other services will be more expensive and harder to get. Second, breaking up the big banks is unlikely to make us safer, despite the assertions of Richard and Simon. Third, the process of breaking the banks up would almost certainly cut bank lending for a number of years at a time when our economy needs more lending, not less. Starting with the role of big banks, I think Paul explained quite well. What we need in America is an ecosystem of finance in which there are many different types of organizations that are thriving; big banks, small banks, insurance companies, many other types of participants. Among those I submit that we do need some very large banks, primarily to serve our largest companies, and even middle sized companies, that need a very wide range of financial services, need them in many locations, including overseas, and need them to be provided at a scale that allows it to be cost effective so they're not excessively priced. This means, when you add this up, we do need some that are quite large. And I would think if they have a criterion, would cross the criterion that they -- my opponents would feel -- meant they should be broken up. And this isn't just my opinion. The Business Roundtable did a survey of CEOs of major U.S. companies, and they very strongly supported the need for banks of this nature. Now, Richard has his Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas, which does some nice research for him. But I'm sorry, Richard, I happen to be more impressed by research papers from two other Federal Reserve banks in St. Louis and in Philadelphia, that have shown quite considerable benefits of this kind of size and scope to quite large levels, that these provide many benefits to society to allow the services to be provided at a reasonable cost without which loans and other services would become more expensive. I also wouldn't want to see us tie our hands in international competition. Now, let me go to my point on no increase in safety, because I don't actually believe that what they're describing would make us safer, even though perhaps in that Churchillian approach, it sounds agreeable to do this, to break up the big banks -- we all seem to hate bankers -- but it's not actually the right way to go. Now, think about why it -- what would be different. Let's say ten years ago, if we had broken up the big banks into 20 pieces each, I don't think much would have been different in the crisis that we had. It would have been severe, it would have happened, and the character wouldn't have been that much different, because these smaller banks that they were broken up into would all have gone the same way, that is, they all would have overinvested in mortgages, both residential and commercial. Now, why do I say that? One, because at the time, almost everybody thought this was smart business. So almost all the players in the financial sector were doing it. Secondly, you can look at what small and medium sized banks did. The ones who actually existed that are supposed by safer, they took on tremendous risk and got hurt quite badly. They were just smaller, so they didn't, each one of them, make the headlines. Smaller size was no protection from risky and ultimately stupid decisions. Richard and Simon imply that smaller banks will take less risk. I don't see it. I don't see it from the incentive structure, and I don't see it from how they actually operated. Put another way, breaking up the big banks would not have affected any of the principal factors that analysts tend to argue caused the financial crisis.  They wouldn't have affected excessive investment in all types of mortgages, reduced standards for those mortgages, government pressure and encouragement to make risky mortgage loans, lacks regulation, poor practices at the rating agencies, a bad bonus culture, excessive risk taking by some individuals and the incentives that existed to create dodgy securitizations. So I don't see why we'd expect it to be safer. Now, you might say, well, we wouldn't have to do a rescue as taxpayers if these were smaller banks. But we saw, in the savings and loan crisis -- -- that we had to do that. If I had more time, I would talk more about this. But you may be surprised that Paul Krugman, no friend of the banks, agrees with us. He said, Breaking up big banks wouldn't really solve our problems, because it's perfectly possible to have a financial crisis that mainly takes the form of a run on smaller banks.  In fact, that's precisely what happened in the 1930s. And if I had more time, I'd give you the rest of the quote. I can do that later if you want. But let me move on to the conclusion here. Keep in mind, Richard and Simon are selling you a theory. We have no actual experience of breaking up the big banks in this way in advanced economies. They cannot promise success. And I personally believe it will do considerable harm. The economy will be less efficient, credit more expensive. We'll be less competitive globally, and I don't see an increase in overall safety. Thank you.  "

    "data":"Well, I apologize if my voice is a little bit gravely but I used up most of it yesterday when I achieved a childhood dream of seeing the Green Bay Packers play at Lambeau Field. And I learned, aside from the fact that Green Bay can lose a game they’re supposed to win, I learned that you can get very funny faces on people’s faces when, very funny looks on people’s faces when you amble up to them in Green Bay and say, So what do you think of them Buy American provisions? It doesn’t, it doesn’t work so well. It’s a real conversation stopper. What I’d like to do is remind you of the proposition before you tonight and that is whether Buy American provisions will backfire. In fact, they’ve already backfired so you have little choice but to vote for the affirmative. First of all, what is Buy American? Buy  American is a provision in federal legislation that mandates the purchase of U.S. made products in government contracts. Now, in some sense, who could be against Buy American? I want people to buy American products. I want a strong and healthy and vibrant American economy. I want good jobs and good wages for American workers. I think we can all agree on those propositions. But that’s not the issue. The debate here tonight is about the means to that laudable end. Buy America may sound like it’s a good idea, but the more you think about it, it’s actually counterproductive. Let me give you a specific example of what Buy America is. In the economic stimulus bill that we talked about earlier, that John Donvan mentioned -- it was passed by Congress earlier this year -- one section requires the use of American made steel in all stimulus related construction projects unless it costs more than twenty-five percent above foreign suppliers. Now, this is a good deal for the American steel industry but it’s a bad deal for the rest of us. By raising the cost of construction projects our nation can afford fewer of those projects. That means fewer jobs will be created with the limited amount of money we have to spend. If we have to pay a twenty-five percent premium for steel that leaves less money for all the other projects. In fact, this is not a trivial matter. Picture in your mind for a moment the Bay Bridge in San Francisco. There’s a lot of steel in that bridge. California had to repair the bridge a few years ago and the Buy America provisions were enforced. The domestic steel bid came in at, guess what?, twenty-three percent above the foreign bid. Now, why it wasn’t twenty-four percent above, I don’t know. But that added four hundred million dollars to the cost to repair the bridge. That’s almost half a billion dollars for one project. Now, what can you do with half a billion dollars? Instead of paying inflated prices for steel you could repair roads, build new bridges, build new schools, invest in green technology, provide health care for children or even perhaps reduce the fiscal deficit that is literally bankrupt... bankrupting the state of California. That’s more than just paying more and getting less. The real problem is this: Buy America is a bad jobs creation program. Steel is very capital intensive so when we increase production we don’t hire a lot of new workers. There are about a hundred and fifty thousand steel workers in the United States. There are seven million construction workers. There are 1.5 million unemployed construction workers. Construction is really labor intensive. So if we spend more taxpayer money on steel we can afford fewer construction projects that will employ more construction workers who really need the jobs. So why do we give U.S. steel producers a twenty-five percent handicap against foreign suppliers and other bidders? Well, they were the only industry that was powerful enough to get it into law. It’s corporate welfare, pure and simple. What percent of the steel sold in the United States is made in the United States? Seventy percent. They control seventy percent of the market and they want more and they want the taxpayer to pay for it. Buy America has already backfired because it creates bureaucratic red tape that has forced state and local governments to delay starting infrastructure projects and therefore, delay getting people back to work. In Perkins, Oklahoma they’re planning on building a new waste water plant for fifteen million dollars. It was shovel ready. The government came in to give them another 1.5 million in free stimulus money. But it wasn’t free. It came with Buy America and other pieces of red tape and it raised the cost of the project even more than the town would be getting from the federal government. So now the town has to go out and borrow more money to get the project going. And this is not an isolated example. Here’s a news article from last week’s Wall St. Journal how Buy America can hurt U.S. firms, and it talks about how, various ways in which U.S. firms cannot bid on municipal projects here in the United States because they may make components that are sent for final processing in Canada. They come back from Canada, and it’s called a Canadian product even though a lot of the value added is made here in the United States. And that just doesn’t make sense. Many think that Buy America is aimed at China. Well, we aimed at China but we hit Canada and now we’re shooting ourselves in the foot. Canadian governments are boycotting U.S. firms in their infrastructure projects and costing us jobs here in the United States. So in sum, Buy America is not a good idea. It raises the cost of -- It sounds like a good idea but it’s not a good idea. It raises the cost of infrastructure projects. It pads the bottom line of the steel industry. It reduces the number of construction workers we can employ with our precious tax dollars and when other countries employ their own buy local provisions our exporters will be cut out of their lucrative market, those lucrative markets abroad and will lose even more manufacturing jobs here in the United States. I’m sure you’ve heard of the saying, What’s good for GM is good for America. Well, we know that’s not true. And what’s good for the steel industry, its workers and its executives is not good for America, either, necessarily. So Buy America is costly corporate welfare. It’s already backfired. Please vote affirmative. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Thank you very much.  I have to tell you that I’ve discarded a lot of my notes because I want to correct the previous speaker. The fact of the matter is that China did win the bid for the Bay Bridge and the fact of the matter is that the Bay Bridge is now almost eight months behind schedule and that the steel that came from China won’t hold the weld. And they’re not sure if they’re going to have to rip it all down and rebuild it, so that, if we talk about what that represents in lost dollars and productivity, it’s way more than the number that Doug used. Let me then go back to my notes. The fact of the matter is that three trillion tax dollars per year are spent by the federal government in federal procurement. And no one is saying that it’s simply, that you get the money that comes from tax dollars and you use it to buy Chinese goods. And then the fact of the matter is this has gone through the roof since the passage of NAFTA and PNTR. And what we’ve done is we’ve lost, in our manufacturing base from 1949 to ’69, manufacturing was twenty-eight percent of the economy of America and we were the world’s largest creditor nation. By the time we got to the end of last year manufacturing was nine percent of the economy and we have now become the world’s largest debtor nation. The fact of the matter is, if we don’t start buying products that are made here, what we’ll end up doing is borrowing Chinese money to import Chinese parts and have laid-off workers. And the fact of the matter is that Buy America stimulates the economy, creates good jobs, makes the industrial economy work and if the industrial economy works then we need engineers, innovation and we need the other pieces that make that economy hum. There was all kinds of yelling and screaming, when the Buy America provision was made public in the stimulus bill, like this is something new. There’s been Buy America provisions since 1930s. And the fact of the matter is that they’ve been good for creating jobs. If we go back to the period from 1994 when we abandoned, in a much more aggressive way, industrial manufacturing in America, in that period of time America has accumulated a 6.5 trillion dollar trade debt. We’ve had twenty-five years in a row, exacerbated since 1994, of year after year after year record breaking trade deficits. This year people will say, Yeah, well, the trade deficit’s falling down. It’s probably going to come in around five hundred billion dollars and we’ve had a huge drop. That’s simply because there’s no purchasing power and we’ve had the collapse of the credit markets. There can be an argument made that a large part of the economic collapse that we saw is because there was too much money in the wrong direction. And the fact of the matter is that, that money, making its hands into a much, much smaller group, led to an inability of us to sustain. And we’ve, over the last fifteen years, gone to personal debt that is unsustainable. All of that because we’ve abandoned the idea of not only making things in America, but buying things that are made in America. I won’t spend too much time, but if we look at what’s going on in most of our trading partners, in the E.U. and spend time with China... I never heard a word in America when French President Sarkozy said that they’re going to stimulate their economy and they’re going to stimulate their auto industry on the condition that every taxpayer dollar of French currency that’s invested in France is going to go to prop up the French auto industry and the French auto industry had to commit to no layoffs. Surprisingly, the European economy is bouncing back faster than ours. I didn’t hear a word. I didn’t hear a word when in May the Chinese government said that their stimulus program was going to be steered and directed towards not just Buy China -- there is a slight difference -- Buy Chinese. I didn’t hear a word here. Think of the auto industry. I’ve only ever driven a North American car, big three. I’ve never had a bad one. But for some reason, we’re prepared as a society to tolerate a deficit in automobiles between South Korea and Japan of forty-five billion dollars a year. If a billion dollars equals thirteen thousand family-supporting jobs, just in the auto sector, year after year after year, we can’t get into their market. They have a view that buying a Japanese car in Japan is a good thing. China has recently announced that it intends to dominate the world in renewable energy products. A company called Suntech Power Holdings said in an interview that to build market share -- this is what’s coming from China -- to build market share it’s selling solar panels on the American market for less than the cost of materials, assembly and shipping. This is a decision made in China. And we’re saying that we want to be the leader in renewable energy but we don’t have a program to stimulate demand or to buy renewable energy products that are made in America. Having said that, I see that my time is up. But keep in mind that in order to do that China cheats on its currency, it manipulates its cost of production and we sit back and say that it would cost us jobs if we did the same thing."

    "data":"Thank you very much. Let me just begin first by emphasizing a point which Doug Irwin made, but in relation to a story. When I was a student at Oxford one of my professors actually told me that he’d gone to Whitehall to advise and he was surprised to find that while he thought economics oversimplified things, that in fact, people in Whitehall were working with even more simplistic models. They usually thought X led to Y and they stopped there. Y leading to Z, Z leading in turn to X. All of that was completely beyond them. They were extremely  oversimplifying. The problem, I think, with Mr. Gerard is, I think, as Doug was pointing out, and with the opposing side basically, is that you think that Buy America will create jobs in the steel using sectors, for example, or in the steel industry. First, in fact, X affects Y. But what does that do to the rest of the system? Because you are then opening up a whole series of additional effects which are actually going to overwhelm the initial primary impact. And that’s essentially what we need to focus on. What are these additional effects? One, of course, is that downstream industries typically become more uncompetitive. We know when President Bush put on the steel tariffs in ’92 the effect was, in fact, to price out a whole lot of steel using industries, including autos, which indeed, there was a famous study which shows that about two hundred thousand jobs may have been lost while we gained a few basically through protecting steel. So that’s point number one. The second point is that you get out of this, and still, even if we didn’t have this problem we would have the problem of retaliation. And I would say it’s not tit for tat retaliation necessarily. It’s also monkey see, monkey do kind of imitation. While we do something others do the same thing. If you look at the 1930s it was exactly spreading and diffusion of all kinds of trade barriers, starting out from the Smoot- Hawley, et cetera. And this, I think, led to essentially what we in economics call a nuclear winter, basically. There was a chaotic outbreak of all kinds of trade barriers. That came home to roost in turn, on our export performance, on everybody’s export performance. And I think this is something we need to remember, that as we go into this, policies like Buy America, that is what we are going to get into. We already see that, as Doug was pointing out, in a variety of fields. And I’m sure Susan will pick up that theme. The large numbers of actual actions which we already see by way of diffusion of these kinds of tariffs. And we are actually the biggest traders in the world. Every state has export industries. I’ve been looking at that. You have basically, therefore, a lot of your jobs at stake. And those are going to outweigh the few jobs you may save through Buy America provisions. I think this is, if you look at Buy America, if you know a little bit of history -- I know just a little bit and Doug knows much more -- but Buy America, when did it first get passed in this country? It has to be in this country, obviously, if it was Buy America. It was 1933, right after the Depression, the great. And that’s what set the stage. And I think we are now re-enacting that after this current crisis. So beware, is all I say. Caveat emptor, if you want, feel inclined to be working for the other side. Then I think we also got the argument, to look at the negative arguments produced by Mr. Gerard in his interesting comment, he said, Well, manufacturers are important and we need to support them. And he’s not the first one to have said that. There has been an anti-de-industrialization movement in England, about twenty years ago. There was also a Berkeley movement called Manufacturing Matters. And I think Mr. Gerard is really harking back to it. And this is a case where you assert that manufacturing is some sort of massive externalities. And I would simply say, I’ll just quote my old teacher, Professor Solow, who is Nobel Laureate and the father figure on the Democratic side. I’m a Democrat. He said, I know there are lots of industries in massive externalities. But there’s a four dollar worth of marginal, social marginal product and the private margin product is one, one dollar. And he said, My problem is I don’t know which ones they are. And the problem is, and compounded by the fact that the lobbies know where the externalities are. And I think this is the problem. It’s not that we don’t believe that there are externalities, but for Mr. Gerard to assume that they are necessarily in steel or in manufacturers more generally has never been proven. And I don’t think any Democrat would support that view. In fact, what we do is essentially to argue that we must support broader policies like R&D support and so on, but not go into specific activities cause that’s exactly the wrong way to go and it gets captured by, by several people. And I think this is what we need to worry about. Finally, I would just touch on one thing which drives, I think, the union movement. And I can understand their fear because I can easily produce models being a theorist also, aside from an activist on these issues. One can easily produce models where international trade actually affects your workers, that in fact the fear is, on the part of unions, that trade with the poor countries produces paupers in the rich countries. Now, a lot of work has been done on this. Actually, there’s very little evidence of this. In fact, there are studies, including my own with Bob Lawrence at Harvard, which show actually that the pressure on our wages, which is a real problem and, you know, as a Democrat I’m entirely sympathetic to the problem. That has been brought about by extremely acute labor saving technical change, by the fact that the unionization has also gone down for reasons which don’t have much to do with globalization or trade. Given that, I think a lot of us have argued with empirical evidence that trade with poor countries, trade with emerging countries has actually kept the consumption cost of workers’ wages down. So it, in fact, it has moderated the -- So I will pick up the argument later."

    "data":"I have totell you that I wrote a book about NAFTA, called The Selling of Free Trade. That’s why I’m here, not because I’m publisher of Harper’s magazine. But may I make a cheap debater’s point right at the outset  and say that Professor Irwin has already veered off the proposition. This is a, the question I thought that was put was, Buy American policies, not the Buy American provision in the legislation that just passed six or eight months ago. And if we’re going to discuss this broadly we have to talk about tariffs versus free trade, protectionism versus free trade. That’s what we’re really talking about here. I would also add that, I hope we can come back to Smoot-Hawley because Smoot-Hawley is a canard, as it is acknowledged by many, many mainstream economists who say that it had little or no affect on exacerbating the Great Depression. But there’s a reason why Thomas Carlyle called economics the dismal science. I happen to think it’s because he understood intuitively that it was not a science, and that it’s not a science because you cannot conduct a controlled experiment in economics the way you can in hard science, in real science. And as a non-science, we have to turn back to the great theorists of free trade and the anti-protectionists like David Ricardo and Richard Cobden and understand that they, in the early 19th Century, could not imagine a world where anybody with money and labor could plug into a power source anywhere in the world and make virtually anything. These theorists, to whom Professor Bhagwati, Professor Irwin and many of their colleagues cling with religious fervor, with -- I might even say -- Marxist fervor, because Ricardo had a great influence on Marx, is what distorts the debate. As then MIT economist Paul Krugman, who was and still is a partisan of free trade, noted in a 1991 book called Geography and Trade, the quote: The tendency of international economists to turn a blind eye to the fact that countries both occupy and exist in space, a tendency so deeply entrenched that we rarely even realize we are doing it, has, I would submit, had some serious costs. These lie not so much in lack of realism -- all economic analysis is more or less unrealistic -- as in the exclusion of important issues, and above all, important sources of evidence. Now, let’s admit, on the protectionist side, that Buy American policies are indirect tariffs, indirect subsidies, whatever you want to call them. And there are many statistics to support the protectionist model. I don’t pretend they’re definitive any more than my economist friends can make the argument that their statistics or their studies are definitive because they’re not scientific experiments. But since we’re talking about protectionism versus free trade, essentially, we can site some spectacularly successful protectionist schemes, Mexico, poor, beleaguered, exploited Mexico in the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s, had a program called import substitution, a nice way of saying, or a technical way of saying, buy Mexican. And Mexico enjoyed the highest growth rates in its history, through the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s, of, roughly, I think averaging about 7 percent. Just to give you a more specific recent example, we still have a 25 percent tariff, import tariff on pickup trucks in the United States. That’s why, Toyota, until very recently, was still manufacturing pickups at their NUMMI, joint operating plant in Fremont, California, in their joint operation with General Motors. That’s what kept Toyota in the game, was the 25 percent tariff on imported pickups. It’s probably not a coincidence that in 1945, the average US tariff on dutiable imports was 28 percent. And in the same year, manufacturing employment which as you all knows pays better than working at Wal-Mart, manufacturing employment as a percentage of total US employment was 35 percent. It’s also likely not a coincidence, that in 2008, the average tariff on dutiable imports was 4 percent—by the way these are Professor Irwin’s numbers— and in the same year manufacturing employment as a percentage of to—total US employment, was just under 10 percent. Now. Again, this is anecdotal evidence, I don’t pretend it’s scientific, but in 1979, the year in which manufacturing employment peaked in the United States, the median weekly earnings for all US workers in 2009 dollars, was $716.47. In the second quarter of 2009, the median weekly earnings for US workers, was $734, just slightly above, so we can make the argument that a pro-free trade, lower-tariff economy has possibly contributed to the stagnation of wages, I think we can say anecdotally, that because manufacturing employment has declined, and manufacturing jobs pay better than service jobs generally speaking, this has contributed to the stagnation of wages. Now, this is not only happening in the, labor-intensive traditional assembly-line jobs. Business Week just had a cover story called  America’s Manufacturing Crisis” in which they talked about, the crisis in high-tech manufacturing. And the causes of this manufacturing decline in American hightech, quote,  are numerous, complex, and a long time in the making.” That’s from Willy Shih, a Harvard Business School professor who used to work at IBM, and used to run Eastman Kodak’s Digital Consumer Products Union. And then, Business Week goes on, to paraphrase they say two decades of unconstrained outsourcing to Asia have hollowed out much of America’s base of supplies, factory managers, and skilled technicians. US private capital markets meanwhile are loath to tie up their billions in factories and machinery. In the boom years from 1994 to 1999, when then economy surged 26 percent, US manufacturing capacity went up by 44 percent. Okay? But from 2002 through 2007 when the US expanded by 17 percent, manufacturing capacity rose a paltry 5 percent. Okay. And I’ll just say that, it’s no coincidence that permanent normal trade relations with China were passed, in 2000."

    "data":"Thank you, and thank you very much for inviting us here today to debate this very timely and very interesting and very complicated topic. I’m going to start by talking about Hire  American policies, which is part of this debate although no one’s talked about it yet and I’m going to make quick work of that, because quite frankly Hire American restrictions are un- American. They are discriminatory, they reek of discrimination, they deny us the very diversity that has made the United States, as competitive as we are. Immigrants built this nation and all you need to do is look at some of the companies that were founded by immigrants or children of immigrants the employ millions of Americans, including Google, Intel, eBay, Yahoo, Proctor and Gamble, duPont and even US Steel. Buy American? Buy American sounds like motherhood and apple pie, and, unfortunately, Buy American policies hurt America, and hurt Americans. And we have history to point to and we have, the fact that the United States has to export to grow, to point to, and the fact that the risk of retaliation is very, very real indeed, let’s start with history. Rick mentioned Smoot-Hawley, well, guess what. In the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act we raised our tariffs, it was perfectly legal under the international trading system at the time. It ultimately prolonged and deepened the Great Depression. No country, no country has ever reached or sustained a level of prosperity with economic isolationism as their policy, with trade protectionism as their policy, with buy national policies. In fact if you look at the 1990s the countries that grew the fast in the 1990s, were countries that opened their markets, followed our lead by the way, opening our markets. They grew three times faster than the countries that did not open their markets. 95 percent of the world’s population, meaning the world’s consumers, live outside of our borders. Those are our customers and if anyone thinks that we Americans have enough money to buy our way to recovery, and to future competitiveness without exports, you’ve got another thing coming. Half of GDP growth, more than half of global GDP growth going forward over the next five years, will come in the advanced developing countries. The bulk of global economic growth will come outside the United States. And if you’re talking about stimulus packages and quite frankly, Rick, this debate is about Buy American policies, meaning the government telling us, that it will not buy foreign goods whether they are higher quality, whether they are better priced. $3.5 trillion will be spent in the next several years, by other countries on stimulus. Globally. We need a piece of that. And if you are a Caterpillar worker in Illinois, if you work for G.E., if you work for any of the major manufacturers in the United States that sell to these countries, you want a part of that action. China is going to be spending the vast majority of the $550 billion it’s putting into stimulus, on infrastructure. That is business for American exporters. India is going to be spending anywhere from $20-$70 billion in roads construction. Now. This issue, this canard, of—that we don’t manufacture anything, is utterly absurd. Some of you may be surprised to know that the United States remains the single biggest manufacturer in the world, bar none. $1.7 trillion in manufacturing outputs, China is a distant second, at $1.3 trillion, with Japan and Germany following up to the rear. One in six manufacturing jobs depends on exports, 6 million US jobs depend on manufactured good exports. And if you look at US economic growth you discover, that our manufacturing is in fact 20 percent of our GDP, not 9 percent. And it continues to grow, our manufacturing output. Yes, our manufacturing employment, because of productivity enhancements, technology, has not kept pace. But if you look for example at a company like UPS that tells us for every 40 new packages that are shipped overseas, they hire a new American worker. Those are high-paying blue-collar jobs, Fed Ex, exactly the same kind of statistics. And in many cases you’re talking about, these are Teamsters who are going to be hired. Retaliation, retaliation is not some myth, retaliation is very, very real, not only did we see it after…Smoot-Hawley, we saw it after the Buy American language, it is not coincidence, that within six weeks of the Buy American legislature on the stimulus package moving through the United States Congress, it is not coincidence that the Chinese suddenly decided to let their provinces favor local companies, because before that a lot of Americans were starting to make a lot of money in those markets. We need access to those markets, and we need to be exporting to stay competitive. The folks who are telling us, this isn’t going to happen, they are ignoring the fact that the Canadians have already retaliated, the Chinese have already retaliated. The US Chamber of Commerce estimates that for every 1 percent of this global stimulus bonanza that is out there, that we lose because of retaliation, we lose 175,000 jobs. That eclipses the, what, eight, 9,000 jobs that the Petersen Institute has told us could possibly be created in the steel industry in the United States, and Doug has already talked about how that has hurt other workers in construction and so on. So let me close…as follows. One, remind you, there is zero evidence that buy national policies create more jobs than they sacrifice, and in fact the data is very, very compelling the other way, trade isolationism kills jobs, it does not create jobs. Buy American sounds good. And the issues that are being raised by the other side in many ways are legitimate issues. But Buy American policies and trade isolationism will not solve any one of the problems that they are describing. Buy American sounds good, good sound bite, bad policy, hurts America, hurts American jobs, thank you."

    "data":"Thank you, thank you, I’m delighted to be here. I was once a  free-trader myself, as was Philip Verlager who I see had a letter in the New York Times just Sunday saying he was once a freetrader. Worked for the Petersen Institute, decided it was totally unrealistic. Enough is enough. I’m a little tired of people who keep telling us—not these people. That wasn’t aimed at you, that, uh Little tired of being told time and again, that being worried about free trade is an oversimplified point of view. I’m a little tired of being given simplistic examples, of where buying, say, steel in the US, will raise construction costs and therefore cost American jobs. I’m tired of being told that empirical studies invariably show that free trade will create—has almost no effect on jobs in the US, and you know I better tell you the truth about that, because, I have a whole bunch of things to say, I’m not going to get to them, and I’m going to forget some. The fact of the matter is, despite what Professor Bhagwati said, and despite his own studies, most studies find a direct negative impact, from free trade on wages, and on the creation of jobs. Most studies. Not by wide-eyed progressives from the New School, but by mainstream economists. Most studies, so let’s get the facts straight. I want to go down this list because this is too important, I’m afraid, to leave to economic theorists. I believed in Ricardian economics, I still do. Exchange is the key to economic growth. You have something I want, I want something—I have something you want. It leads to economic growth, but it is a narrow idealistic theory, in a very complex world. First, Buy America is not illegal. China agreed to the very terms we are citing in this stimulus bill. That’s number one. It is not illegal, neither by the way are the tariffs on tires. Not illegal, they agreed to it, in the international agreements. Number two. The fiscal policy becomes necessarily ineffective when 20 to 30 to 40 percent of every dollar we spend, to pump up our economy in a recessionary emergency, leaks overseas. We’re not saying all—we should not have exports and imports, nobody on my teams thinks we shouldn’t have export growth, and even import growth. Nobody I know believes that. But we do want effective fiscal policy and that is what we are talking about in the narrow sense. Will there be a trade war? Darn it, I am tired of these scare tactics, I’m tired of claiming there will be a repeat of the 1930s. Is China up in arms against this policy, I suspect China is now willing to talk a little bit, because they see maybe President Obama is ever so slightly serious about imposing rights he was given in international treaties into which China agreed. Is China not pushing its tires, a surge in tires here? Of course they are. And that was a response, another issue. Let’s stop isolating this economic theory from the real world. China subsidizes, all kinds of countries subsidize, all kinds of countries push exports. We have to begin to realize that. Let’s look at what’s happened, and I’m skipping as you can tell a little bit, let’s look at what’s happened in America since free trade. Don’t think this side of the podium is fighting an uphill battle. They won. They’ve won for decades. Tariffs have come down significantly. And where does America stand in terms of wages, you’d think, judging by what some of them said, we’re doing great. The median male worker in America today, makes less than the median male worker after inflation did in the 1970s. Think about that. That stagnation probably never occurred in American economic history before. We did some numbers on this, it’s pretty stun— I’m not going to go into those because, my time is running low, maybe we’ll get to it in the Q-and-A. Frank Levy, and Peter Temin, mainstream economists, at MIT, are alarmed, that annual earnings of all workers, not just males, male and female, all races, all ethnicities, plus fringe benefits, which people often say are left out by—people like Robert Lawrence often make this case—plus fringe benefits haven’t been keeping up with productivity since roughly the late 1970s. Wages are supposed to keep up with productivity. What’s going on, is free trade part of this? I think it is part of it. Is it all of it, no, is it most of it, it may not even be most of it. But it’s probably some of it and we’ve gotta start thinking about that. I have to say one other thing about economic theory while I’m going through this litany. There is a very strong emphasis on keeping wages down in America, you may have noticed, every time wages go up the Federal Reserve in the good old days, that was before the crisis, would try to push wages down because it was going to be inflationary. A very important theory of why economies grow, has been thrown aside. That is economies grow because American workers, and the immigrant workers who come to America make enough money to support demand so the companies can grow. And then companies invest. All through American history, wages rose inexorably. In America, median wages, average wages, rose, and were a source of economic growth. That stopped somewhere in the 1970s. And we better start thinking about it, what am I thinking, what am I talking about? Not full-scale protectionism, not the end of exports and imports. But a serious, committed, complex…not simple theory, of why economies grow, but a complex analysis and approach to dealing with a high dollar. With high debt in America. With trade inequalities. With industrial policies and export subsidies overseas. And an attempt, and I think interestingly, the other side did not use its strongest argument. Free trade, our buying from overseas, helps those poor countries, where wages are really low. I think as decent human beings we should all be for them, look what’s happened. It hasn’t gotten to them for the most part. It hasn’t gotten to them in nearly the amount it should. We’ve got to think much more broadly about this issue, thank you."

    "data":"I’m willing to prove it. Thank you.  California is the first failed state, and most of you probably believe that already. Which is a tactical disadvantage for us on this side, but if you do, we want to keep your vote. For the rest of you, we’d like to convince you of that this evening. And, before I start doing that, I just want to clear away something that might be confusing. The proposition is cheeky, as all of you know, all good Oxford-style debates start with a cheeky proposition. The reason this one is cheeky, is that  failed states” usually refer to sovereign states. Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Haiti. And what those have in common, is that they have lost a monopoly on legitimate violence, if you think that through, or maybe back to Poli. Sci. When that happens, warlords take over or maybe Somalian pirates, and the state as such loses authority, well clearly, no one on the stage tonight is going to argue in the next two hours that California is already ruled by warlords or pirates. So what are we talking about when we talk about one of the 50 states, domestic states. We have to agree to a working definition to make this interesting. California and other domestic states that may follow have failed, if they fail to support their citizens and instead hinder them. What’s another way of saying that is, if a state, if the governance part of the state as opposed to private industry, can no longer address or solve the problems it faces, then it has failed. California easily meets those criteria. And I just want to quickly because that timer is running already, run down some of the problems to remind you, maybe we can go into them later in depth. Prisons, California has the worst recidivism rate in the country, how did it get like that. Water, it’s an infrastructure and a climate issue but it’s also a political, a governance issue. Education. Before California became a failed state in the Pat Brown era of the ‘50s and ‘60s it built the best public university system in the country, it is currently dismantling that because it is now a failed state. Budgets. And a state is supposed to have a budget, to pass it on time, California never does, that started well before the recession. California—or states are supposed to pay their bills to their vendors and so forth, as all of you know, probably all of you know, California has been paying with I.O.U.’s. Courts. I asked Ronald George, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, whether he thought it was a failed state, he could say [sic] you could argue that, if the state no longer administers justice because its courts are closed part of the time, and dockets of cases is backlogged. California has the worst credit rating of the 50, you know that, it was just lowered again by S&P. Our opponents may try to convince you tonight that this has something to do with the Great Recession, and that as soon as there’s a recovery these problems will recede. It’s not true, all of you have heard Warren Buffett say it’s only when the tide goes out when you learn who’s swimming naked. California has been undressing since the 1970s, I hope to get into that. I argue that it’s been stark naked since the ‘90s, and indeed, the tide has just now gone out with the Great Recession but that’s not something that happened overnight, the failure that is, the nakedness. It’s just been revealed. Our opponents may also argue that California has problems, but all states have problems, as Mr. Rosenkranz reminded you here. And that that does not amount to failure, that’s not true, that’s not appropriate in the case of California, because only one state has all problems simultaneously. And when you have all problems simultaneously you tie them together into a straitjacket and that’s what California is in, it’s in a straitjacket, because of its governance structures. I want to develop that in the time that remains right now a little bit, and then hopefully go deeper into it later in the evening to show to you what the unique aspect of that confluence is. Unique number 1. Three states, for example, have the super-majority requirement that both houses of a legislature have two-thirds votes to pass a budget, three states. Arkansas, Rhode Island, and California, nothing unusual yet. 16 states have the same super-majority required to raise taxes. Only one state has both. How did California— California is that state. How did California get that second super-majority requirement. It was the infamous Prop 13, I understand it’s famous even on this coast…1978 when they started undressing. It is part of something called direct democracy that the founders of the nation, as opposed to the state, were very skeptical and afraid of—about, afraid of. It includes initiatives, referenda and recalls. 24 states have initiatives, have direct democracy. Only one does not allow its legislature, to amend initiatives that its own voters have passed, no matter how insane. Only one state, only one state has the process, has really run certifiably amok, out of control, insane, in only one state, do the inmates run the asylum. Tonight, you may hear that California, this usually comes up, has great weather. You may hear about its beautiful redwoods, Yosemite’s gorgeous. You may hear about the vibrancy of Silicon Valley which I used to cover. All that is true, it’s all irrelevant. Because we’re not talking about whether or not the state has assets. Whether or not there are some good things in the state. Of course there are. We’re talking about whether the state as such, the structures that make the state, the governance structures, have failed, and indeed they have, and the other states must be very careful unless they have the same unique—the same combination of problems that put them in the same straitjacket, and also lead to failure. Our opponents are great orators…don’t let them confuse you tonight… I’ll be back in a little, in a few minutes, but for now just remember what the definition of a domestic failed state is, remember to stay on our side, stay on our side, you probably are there already. California is the first failed state. "

    "data":"Thank you. Thank you, John, I’m thrilled to be back in New York, as John said I was born here, many of my relatives are here, actually most of my relatives. I graduated from Columbia Law School. And not to be undone, NYU sent me two graduate students to help me get reelected in 2002, so. I’m fond of New York, I think I have a sense of how New Yorkers think and I think a lot of you probably voted that California is the first failed state, so my hope is that I can impress you with what is right about California, and why it’s already an asset to the nation, and will be more of an asset as we move forward in this global society. First let me acknowledge that there are problems in Sacramento…but the shortcomings of our elected officials should not detract from the creative contributions of our 37 million citizens. Our GDP which is one way we measure societies in this world, is $1.9 trillion, far and away the largest in America. Larger than Russia, larger than India, larger than Canada. In fact the eighth largest in the world. And if we were a separate country, we would be a member of the G8. So one way we measure societies in a capitalistic world, is by their GDP and certainly California has no apologies for that. I’m also pleased to see that a recent edition of Time magazine agreed, and was very bullish on California. It titled its piece,  California is Still the American Dream,  and I quote:  It is —  it  meaning California—  is the cutting edge of America’s future. It is the greenest, most diverse…most global…and most Asian-oriented society at a time when the world is moving in all those directions. It is an unparalleled engine of innovation, a Mecca of high-tech, biotech, and now clean-tech. In fact, from 2006 — and I’m still quoting— 2006 to 2008, it received 60 percent of all the clean-tech investments in this country, and in 2008 it received more venture capital funds than the other 49 states combined.  With all of its problems it still managed to nurture some of the most innovative companies in the world, Google, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Cisco, Intel, Disney, eBay, and many other companies that are helping invent the future for California and for the— for America. California is all about change. It likes to get there first, and it frequently does, it was the first state to regulate greenhouse gases. It was the first to allow full-scale stem-cell research. It was the first to establish renewable energy portfolio standards. What do I mean by that. It said to its utilities, use renewable energy. Depend less on fossil fuel. As governor I was proud to sign all those bills into law, but prouder still, to be part of a 35-year tradition of promoting energy efficiency and energy conservation. Now why am I talking about this. Because, the green economy is the next great wave in the American economy. We have to be green, we have to be reorienting the grid, we have to live more lightly on the planet if we are going to compete globally. 35 years ago, during the first energy crisis, California decided, if it wanted to promote conservation, it has to give the utilities a financial incentive to permit that. So it said to the utilities, you can make more money if you encourage your customers to consume less. And ever since then, we’ve been regulating everything that uses electricity, from appliances, refrigerators, dishwashers, homes, all kinds of businesses, cars, and even lately flat-screen TVs, and along the way, we saved rate-payers $56 billion, and avoided building 24 new power plants. In fact, our electricity growth has been nada, zippo, zero, over 30 years, as we became the largest state in America--the rest of the country is more than 50 percent. Why do I tell you that? Because how America obtains energy in the future, will be critical to our economy, our environment, and to national security. And I submit to you that California’s proven leadership in this area over the last 35 years, will stand this nation in very good stead. Now to be sure, we have problems in Sacramento, but believe me, the voters have tuned in to this issue, and they have already made change that’s substantial. For many years the legislators drew their own districts, meaning they decided in what district they would run, they decided you would be in my district, you would not. And so not  surprisingly, they almost never lose. Governor Schwarzenegger proposed a redistricting plan, it passed, I supported it because I believe it’s time the voters draw the line, not the people [sic], and it’s time we bring accountability to Sacramento, that will kick in in 2012 and that will make a big difference. Now voters get punished if they react harshly towards their core constituencies, Republican-raised taxes, they have all kinds of recall attempts against them, Democrats punish the teachers, there’s a primary opponent next time. Under a redistricting plan, if you don’t solve the problem, you will get defeated. Similarly in June there is an open primary…a change I predict California will embrace, I support it, I’m the only governor elected in an open primary, the Supreme Court of the United States struck it down, but they have approved this version. It’s essentially a municipal election. If anyone can vote, independents, Republicans and Democrats, and you can vote for a Republican for governor or a Green Party for governor or a Democrat for governor. The top two vote-getters run off in the general election, even if they’re from the same party. That’s going to produce pragmatic, moderate problem-solving candidates. Finally there’s a call for a constitutional convention. I support that idea. It’s time we eliminated in my judgment the two-thirds vote requirement to pass a budget. Yes, we have a two-thirds vote requirement to pass a budget, and a separate one to pass the budget. Just that requirement to get a two-thirds vote to pass a budget is the reason we are always late, it’s ridiculous, only three other states have it. I think that’s the kinda thing a constitutional convention will change, and if the changes are, are sensible, the voters will accept it. So in short, our private sector is the envy of the world, and innovation will lead America, into a future that is brighter and stronger. Our public sector is on the mend and will get better at the end of 2010. Vote no, number 2, vote no. "

    "data":"Well, I—it would be and I’ll tell you this. One of the—I’m not running, but— [LAUGHTER] Be an honor to serve butt--and I’ll tell you why, first of all, California is not a failed state and our colleagues have pretty much conceded that they cannot win this argument based on the assertion that it’s a failed state so instead they point to some failings. But what they haven’t told you is that every single one of the problems—structural and otherwise—that have been pointed to you, have solutions, and the solutions are now on the way. We have in our state… We are the biggest state—we have some of the biggest problems—we also have the biggest potential for problem solving, and the largest number of problem solvers. So every one of the structural problems that has been pointed out—from redistricting to the tax issues, to the budget issues—have gathered the combined wisdom across the political spectrum, there are now ballot measures moving forward, there are solutions for these problems. To say that California is a failed state is different than saying it has some failings. We have some serious failings, but we also have a set of assets, that our friend was trying to make sure you didn’t pay attention to, that will help us solve these problems. First of all, when you look at a state like California, you look at a state that, on the three critical issues that are most important for our country, California is not failing—it is succeeding and it is leading. What are the three critical issues? Number one, how will we power America, as the governor just talked about. How will we power this country? Will we continue to rely on the post well oil strategy that we have been stuck in, with petroleum and coal for 100, 150 years now—it’s the post whale oil strategy—we’ll continue with that? Or will, will we innovate our way out? Will we invent and invest our way out? In California, that is what we are doing. In a failed state, capital does not flow in—capital flows out. In California, we have quadrupled—in the past two years—the amount of venture capital flowing into the state, because we are trying to solve the biggest problem humanity faces: the problem of global warming, and the biggest problem our country faces: the problem of energy independence. California is leading and succeeding in that. We just attracted a company, Electric Vehicles International, to come and build zero emission cars in California. They could have gone anywhere in the world. They came to California because of the policy certainty, because of the consumer demand, because we are on the front edge. We have policies in place passed—despite all the problems with our legislature—we have passed on a bipartisan basis with a Republican governor…a Democratic legislature, AB 32, our Global Warming Solution Act, which will drive the creation of 400,000 clean and green jobs. We have set high aspirations with regard to renewable energy. Possibly, as many as three-quarters of a million jobs that will be created there. 15,000 jobs right now in solar, in the solar industry, and growing. A failed state doesn’t do that. That is not a failed state.  Number two yes, Sacramento has a ton of problems. Help is on the way. Great ideas are on the way. But the entire State of California did not live in Sacramento. We have an incredible level of innovation at the governance level, cities, and regionally across the state, because the second big problem is—how are going to live together in cities? How are we going to live together at a community level? Can we solve problems? You see in California, problems are being solved every day—tough problems. Look at the problems with the port of Los Angeles—just to brag a little bit on the people of California—where the pollution was so bad that little kids who live close to the port of Los Angeles were getting asthma and dying, and people said that we can’t solve this problem because of the logjams and all the special interests. They got together, they sat down, they came up with a Clean Truck Program that helped lift the living standards of 10,000 truckers. Got new technology in those trucks on the roads, and took asthma inhalers out of little girls’ and little boys’ pockets. That is the kind of problem solving that’s going on at the local level. In Fresno, you have a wonderful new mayor, Ashley Swearengin, who has been able to pull people together in the agricultural heartland of our state, and create 19,000 new jobs, through a regional economic initiative. In Northern California, you have mayors like Gavin Newsom, Ron Dellums and others who had come together, who have come up with local creative financing to get green home improvements going, weatherization and solar panels attached to property taxes so people can actually get all these new technologies going. And these are the kinds of things that are happening on a daily basis. And those things don’t happen in a failed state. In a failed state, when things are tough, people turn on each other. In California, people are turning to each other, and working together across lines of class and color. And the last thing I want to say is that the, the third big challenge for this country and for this world is—how are we going to live together? In the age of this kind of diversity, how are we going to live together? There is a miracle every single day in California, a miracle. And it’s a miracle of cooperation. In Oakland, California, there are 30 to 40 different languages spoken in the public schools—30 to 40 different languages spoken in the public schools. To the extent that there is conflict—it’s not about that…it’s not about that. We have been able to figure out a way to come together, to work together. That is not just a good example for the United States…that’s a good example for the world. There is no place in the world that has the kind of diversity and density that we have…that manages to do it with elegance, that manages to do it successfully. And when you have a state where 20 years ago there was a conflagration over race and ethnicity—people remember Los Angeles 20, almost 20 years ago. Somebody stood up and said, “Can’t we all get along? Can’t we all get along?” Californians have answered that question—yes we can, yes we can get along—and we do it every day. And it’s out of that community of many colors, many classes, with every faith, every sexuality, working together on a daily basis, that great solutions have come in our economy, have come in local governments, and are now coming from our state governance. This is not a failed state. We have some failings, but this state is a state that is now rallying to solve those problems. Don’t vote against us, vote for us. Thank you very much. "

    "data":"Thank you very much. I also want to put in a plug for Red, which I started also with my great colleague, Bono, my partner—which I always like saying. Because most of my life, people have been saying other things about me. I was President Kennedy’s nephew. When my dad started the Peace Corps, I was Sergeant Shriver’s son. When my mom started the Special Olympics, I was Eunice Shriver’s son. And then a terrible thing happened in our family—my sister went on national television and became the host of the CBS Morning News. So four brothers, very competitive Irish family, were faced with the prospect that we were going to be known forever as Maria Shriver’s brothers. So we had a meeting—what could we do about it? And we had various ideas, none of them very good. And at one point, one of my brothers said,  Well, face it, you know, it’s done, and it can’t get any worse.” And then Maria got married. So, I love it when I go and see in the program that I am Bono’s partner, because I am really tired of being Arnold Schwarzenegger’s brother-in-law. I appreciated our eloquence of some of our colleagues, but I want to point out very, very specifically that all of the answers are on the way. They are not here now. And I can tell you in local government, where I serve on the City Council in Santa Monica, that things are bad. We are lucky in Santa Monica because we have a great, diverse tax base. But just to give you a couple of illustrations… Our redevelopment agency had a budget this year of 30 million dollars—the state took 22 million of that. How can you work on that basis? And this is a reminder also, that when you talk about the state, you are not talking about Google and Intel…and you are not talking about local government…you are talking about the state government. It’s very important. The state is a constitutional entity, it’s a legal entity. It’s not California. When Steve Jobs writes on every Apple product,  designed in California, assembled in China,” he is not talking about designed in the State House of California…he is talking about in the culture of California, which I think we all agree is the greatest culture in America and maybe in the world. Thank you. There are local Californias in the culture. Think about it. Right now… A good interesting point, segue, I’ll go to your idea. There is no art education in the state in the public schools. We are the last in the state, in all of the 50 states. We are below Guam in arts education. I am serious. I mean, it’s… It’s kind of a little funny, but it’s hard to believe really… And that’s a state responsibility. The money is not there. Why is the money not there? Because the people have lost confidence in the government obviously. I’ll give you another example. In Los Angeles, we have the biggest homeless population in America, 80,000-plus people. The L.A. County Jail is the largest mental health facility in the world…in the world. If you go there, every single one of you—I don’t care what your background or point of view on this debate would be—would be sickened to see what’s going on in there. There is a famous quote from the, uh, I think it’s Hammerati who said,  The purpose… One of the purposes of government is to protect the weak from the strong.” We have completely failed. You go in that L.A. County Jail and you will see the weakest people in our society…mentally ill people living in cages…there are 14 full-time pharmacists to medicate them…in Downtown L.A. Of the 85 or some-odd thousand people that are homeless, about a third are veterans. We have a 400-acre property in West L.A. in Westwood…that have empty buildings in it…which were built as mental institutions for veterans that are empty—and have been empty for more than 20 years. Why is that? The state hasn’t cooperated with the feds to fix that… I don’t know…I can’t come here and give you an answer. I have been trying to fix it for the last five years, and so far I have failed. Although President Bush and Secretary Nicholson did designate three of the buildings for homeless veterans—which is a positive thing. And I understand that one of the answers on the way—there is 50 million dollars in the new defense appropriations bill for that building, which would be a great thing. But the fact that people burnt… And in my little ol’ Santa Monica, a man burnt to death in a dumpster…a homeless man, burnt to death in a dumpster several months ago…is unacceptable. And you would say, well, that, you… as a senior official of the state said to me,  Well, Bob, you know, you gotta calm down. You know, you gotta… You are very hopped up about this homeless thing.” And he said,  Why are you so hopped up about it?” I said,  I am afraid my mom—God bless her and God rest her soul—is going to hear that a homeless guy burnt to death in a dumpster in my jurisdiction”…which is what she used to call it,  my jurisdiction,” not  my constituency.” [LAUGHTER] Because she would be enraged. has to do with, can you run the trains on time? Thank you. So, going on to the kinds of things that Sharon said. The public community—which is really the primary goal of the state—not to get too esoteric about it—but to have a kind of political compassion for people does not exist. You can’t have that many homeless people…you can’t have the underfunding of education that exists…you can’t have that many homeless veterans…and say that the state has been successful in creating—amongst its citizens—a concept of political  compassion. That we are going to get together… We have community interests. We are going to get together and we are going to do something about them. And ideas are on the way… And green tech, great. It’s all fantastic. For the least of these, it’s not fantastic in California. It’s really not.  I’ll give you another example—a local example. The City of Beverly Hills has a school system, Santa Monica has one. The state is organizing school districts like that. They had kids from out of the City of Beverly Hills in that district, because the state used to pay—and still may—a certain amount per student. So you would bring people from out of your district who were not there and educate them. They changed that formula recently, and what did Beverly Hills do?—and they are not bad people—they expelled all those kids. Why? We are not getting paid for it anymore. That’s a state failure—not a Beverly Hills failure, not a failure of those communities. So as you think about how you are going to vote, it’s very important to say… And I like to be optimistic—and I am optimistic. When they asked me, which side of this debate did I want to be on, I said I wanted to be on this one. And they said, well, don’t you want to be on the optimistic side? I said, this is the optimistic side. [LAUGHTER] This is the optimistic side. Because if you don’t know that the problem is as bad as it is…if you don’t go to the L.A. County Jail and see that…you think—and I mean this respectfully—that help is on the way. Help is not on the way. We, this year…I’ll give you one final example. The CalPERS—the pension charged to little, to cities—going up 25 percent. In our budget, that’s a breaker, you know? So it has nothing to do, as I said—I am repeating myself—with Google…it "

    "data":"Thank you. Do I really have seven minutes? Because, you know, on MSNBC, I never get out more than a sentence and a half before Pat Buchanan interrupts me, so  I don’t know that I have seven minutes. I had some prepared material, which I will use some of. But I would like to very quickly go through some of the points that you have heard from the presenters of this preposterous idea. I want to though give you the correct concept that you are aiming for here, in that, in the title of this proposition, is it the first, the first failed state? What that means is, is it the worst of 50 states? All this side has to do—all it has to do—is give you the idea that there might be somewhere…in the 50 states somewhere…one—one—that’s doing something worse than California…or maybe doing everything worse than California. And oh, by the way, might also be a slightly less desirable place to live. That’s our chore. We have to find you one that you don’t want to live in. And you know, the proposition was defined by Andreas at the beginning. He had to admit that it was a cheeky proposition. The backing off from the strength of the declaration and the proposition. He mentioned recidivism rates in California prisons—they are not good. Crime is down, does that count? Does it matter that in Los Angeles crime is down dramatically because the mayor had the wisdom to import the police commissioner that Rudy Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani’s ego couldn’t stand in this city, Bill Bratton? Bill Bratton came out to L.A. in the process… and through an exercise of government—local government and local police work—got that crime rate down dramatically, as he did here. You will hear about different problems. You will hear Bobby talking about the homeless. That’s important. That is, that is tragic. But remember what the case is here. The case is, is it somehow a California issue? Is what Bobby talked about a California issue? California has more homeless people than any other state. It has more wealth than any other state. It has more poverty than any other state. It has more agricultural production than any other state. It has more people. It has more. Every single thing they will tell you about anecdotally—yes, California has the most of it. But as we sit here in the lower end of Manhattan, is it conceivable…is it conceivable that a homeless person has died in gruesome circumstances, in gruesome circumstances in this zip code, ever? Or maybe, how often? Is that the question for this zip code? You know, Sharon mentions getting around is difficult. The traffic is hard. It is hard. It’s hard to get your car to a Dodgers game from Santa Monica, where Sharon and I live, that is true. What time do you have to leave to get a 7:00 P.M. flight from JFK? From here. Not from up in the Upper West Side, where it’s even more difficult. But what time…? When would you leave? 3:00? I mean, you know, factor in some security issues at the airport… I don’t take 7:00 P.M. flights from JFK, because I can’t get there. It’s just not going to work—I am going to have to surrender too much of the day.  The budget cuts in the university system, budget cuts—educational budget cuts have been mentioned. Take your time. Take all the time you need to come up with the name of a better public university—not in the 50 states, in the world—a better public university than the University of California at Berkeley. Take your time. We have all night.The delicious irony…the delicious irony of having this debate…in this state… Today’s local paper, The New York Times, in its seemingly endless editorial series called  The Failed State.” It stars—as usual—Albany. They have… This one happens to be about the ethics bill that they are… the improvement in the ethics program that they are trying to introduce in Albany. Utterly hopeless. You would think there would be some momentum for that—after Joe Bruno gets convicted, of actually running businesses out of his office and all other sorts of illegalities—there would be some momentum for it. It’s hopeless, it won’t happen. You don’t know what the outside income is of your state legislators—and you don’t know it by law. So when you want to have this debate about failed states and failed state governments—with the state legislature that you have—having it here is cheeky. I lived here longer than I have lived in Los Angeles. I worked in government with Senator Moynihan. Very much concerned with issues facing this state. Very much concerned with its fair share, for example. The problem… And what we discovered…and what we harped on endlessly back in the ‘80s and ‘90s was New York sends more money to the federal government than it gets back—hence, all of its budget problems. Well, the problem is much worse in California. California gets 79 cents back for every dollar that it sends to the federal government. So the reason you don’t have 40 other so-called failed states is because California tax money is paying for Alabama, it’s paying to keep Alaska running, it’s paying to keep Arkansas afloat. You can’t balance any of the books in those states without the money that comes out of California pockets to fund it. There is much more to be said about this. I am running out of time to do it. I didn’t think I had six minutes… seven minutes, thank you."

    "data":"That's all you can come up with? As was stated, China is a communist nation in name only. It's not communist in the way the Soviet Union was communist. And unfortunately China kind of gives communism a good name in a way that we give capitalism a bad name. And I thought maybe a more appropriate way to have framed this debate is not, you know,  Does China do capitalism better?  but it might -- but might be,  Does America do capitalism worse than China?  because neither modern America or China does capitalism anywhere near as well as we did it in the 19th century. But the problem is China is closer to what America used to be than America is today. And if you think about America at the end of the 19th century in the year 1900, the government in this country spent 3 percent of the GDP on all levels, 3 percent. Today the American government spends better than 40 percent of our GDP. If you look at China, it's about half as much of the GDP spent. If you look at taxes, which is a real measure of freedom, back in America in the 1900s, we had no income taxes, we had no corporate income tax, no state income taxes, Americans were truly free in the sense that they got to keep the production, the fruits of their labor. If you look at modern America and modern China, taxes are very high. They're just a lot higher here than they are in China. Individual income taxes, the typical American pays a much higher share of his income in taxes when you take income taxes on a federal and state level and payroll taxes and the employer portion that's passed on, paying much higher income taxes on a personal level than the typical Chinese worker does. If you look at corporations, our corporate income tax now is, what, 35 percent, China's 25, we tax dividends at 15 percent, they're at 10 percent, so a significant difference in the amount of money that the individuals are allowed to keep. You know, the American government is taking a much larger share of what people earn, and that's what's freedom, it's keeping the fruits of your labor. Also, if you look at the regulatory environment in both China and the United States, I would argue that a young entrepreneur in America today is going to face much greater hurdles, bigger obstacles in his path that have been placed there by the government than you would have in China. The costs of complying with all the rules and regulations in America exceeds the costs in China, and not just the rules and regulations, but surviving the litigation that is a byproduct of those rules and regulations. A lot of the things that the government does, if employers don't do them properly, they open themselves up to all sorts of lawsuits, not just by government but by their employees or their customers and you don't face that kind of problem to anywhere near that extent in China. So if you look at it from the point of view of taxation, you look at it from the point of view of regulation, sure, both countries have a lot of regulation. I mean, China is not as capitalistic as Hong Kong, which is a part of China but is more capitalistic than the mainland. But if you're going to compare it to the United States, the level of taxation, the level of government spending, if you look at the debt, I mean, America has -- our government has an enormous debt. Our debt is now 100 percent of our GDP, and that is if you just count the funded portion of our debt. If you look at the off budget items, the unfunded portion of our debt, it's enormous. The Chinese government doesn't have anywhere near that kind of liability. In fact, if you look at China and the United States and just compare the results of their economy. China is today, the world’s largest creditor nation. America is the world’s biggest debtor nation. China has large trade surpluses. America has enormous trade deficits. So if you thought about it as a nation, China has got -- I mean if you thought about the nation as a country, or as a corporation rather, China has a lot of assets on its balance sheet and lots of income, lots of profits. America is loaded up with liabilities and we’re hemorrhaging red ink. We have huge losses. So if you think that America is more capitalist than China or China is more socialist, then you must think that socialism is a better economic system because after all, the Chinese are more successful if you want to measure it by the accumulation of assets, by the positive balance of trade. So, and I don’t think that there is a way for a country, if you remember the Soviet Union, which was a Communist country, the Soviet Union didn’t make anything, they didn’t produce anything. We constantly had to give them money so that they can feed themselves. Pretty much everything is being made in China today and the United States; they have this enormous trade surplus. And more importantly, they’re accumulating massive savings. If you look at China, they have a savings rate of close to 50 percent. We have a savings rate, basically negative. In fact we rely in America on a Ponzi scheme called Social Security. They don’t have Social Security in China. They don’t have a lot of these big government programs that we have in the United States. Look at our monetary system. We have the Federal Reserve, price fixing, interest rates at practically zero. In all the macroeconomics and balances that we create, we micromanage our economy through our tax code. We’ve got the U.S. government subsidizing or guaranteeing of almost 100 percent of all the mortgages in the United States, so it’s not up to the free market. Credit isn’t being allocated by the market; it’s being allocated by government. Government is deciding who should get money and who shouldn’t get money and who it should subsidize and who it should penalize. It does all of this through the tax code and through the Federal Reserve. Yes, you’ve got something similar going on in China, only in China I think it’s more above board. Yes, there is government and you know that government’s involved and maybe you have to bribe the right bureaucrat, but the same thing is going on in the United States. We’re just not as above board with it. And if you think about the partnership that government has with business in the United States, most of the laws and regulations, and I work in a highly regulated field in the securities industry, but this is the same with industries all over the United States. You have all these regulatory bodies that are created for the specific purpose of destroying competition and trying to prevent smaller firms from coming into existence or competing with these large firms that have captured all the regulatory bodies that oversee them. And that is a function of government, and it’s a combination of big business working with big government to stifle innovation and to stifle capitalism. And when you have the U.S. government taking such an enormous share of our GDP and taking such an enormous share of our output in taxation and then trying to regulate it and micromanage it from Washington D.C., we’re not even close to being a capitalist country anymore in the United States. The unfortunate thing is that China is closer. But what’s more important is the direction in which the pendulum is swinging. In China, it’s swinging towards capitalism. Unfortunately in America, it’s swinging away.  "

    "data":"First of all, Orville said that China is a fickle mistress. And so getting China right is hard. And one thing we do all need to admit is that the level of volatility in outcomes in China over the next 10 to 20 years is vastly greater than the level of volatility in the United States or in Europe or Japan. Can China make it? Can they fundamentally transform their economic and political system? A country of 1.3 billion people. We know they need to it. The World Bank just made it very clear. The Chinese government admitted it themselves. Doesn’t mean they can do it, it’s never been done before. It’s a bet. I’d bet against. But it’s a bet. If you have to make a bet, you bet on the United States. Lots of people do, that’s why the U.S. still has the world’s reserve currency. I don’t know even where to start on this frankly, having just heard that China needs to bribe the right bureaucrats--but same in the United States, we’re not as above board about that... That’s on its face ludicrous, right? China is a system where if you want to do well, the highest levels, 52 percent of the GDP -- 62 percent of the GDP is state-owned enterprises, absolutely there is no rule of law. There’s no transparency. You don’t have as many regulations in China as the U.S. That is true. Does that mean China does capitalism better? No. It means that if you’re China and you want to move a village and build a road, you can. It is not clear to me that that is capitalism in its most effective or even most rapacious form. That’s the state doing what it wants to do for the state. That’s the problem. You want to talk about state intervention? We’ve got it. We’ve got it in China. Look, it’s unfortunate to me we’re even debating this. Five years ago, we wouldn’t. It shames me. It shames me as an American because there are people out there that believe that the United States can’t do capitalism as well as China. There are countries now that are doing capitalism better than the United States. If we were having this debate about Canada, we wouldn’t have as much of a problem. We wouldn’t, right. On a lot of fronts -- I’m willing -- I’m not saying the United States is worse on everything. I’m saying that life increasingly, if you look at issues like the deficit for the U.S., if you look at financial regulations -- I’m not going to stand behind all that. But I am going to go after China, because ultimately we have a problem. Look, the Chinese system is not just capitalist; it’s state capitalist. State capitalism is a system where the state is the principal actor in the economy. And it uses markets ultimately for their own political gain. If it turns out that profit is useful for their political gain, they’ll go for it. If it turns out it isn’t, they’ll go against it. And that’s true whether we’re talking about Chinese firms or whether we’re talking about Western firms. I mean, Facebook’s doing a pretty good IPO, but they’re not in China. Why? China doesn’t want Facebook in China. It’d make a lot of money. It’d make a lot of money for China. That’s not the point, right. That’s not capitalism. That’s a problem. Ultimately, when we’ve seen state capitalism work globally, it works until it fails. And it works because despite the fact that the state is massively inefficient, and I suspect Peter admits that the state is massively inefficient, and it is in lots of forms, but it can hide its inefficiency through cheap stuff. Argentina was state capitalist, looked as good as the United States in the Western hemisphere over 100 years ago until they ran out of cheap land. And then they started defaulting. Venezuela looked great on cheap oil. Not so much anymore, right. China’s looked great for 34 years on the basis of cheap labor. China will ultimately run out of cheap labor. So, what we have in China is this extraordinary car with a huge engine going very fast down a long road. And that road has been straight for 34 years, but coming up there’s a big turn in the road…. And we’ve never seen steering. And the fact is that if you are China, there’s one thing you’re going to have a very hard time doing. There are no more Zhu Rongjis and Deng Xiaopings in China. You don’t have strong individual leadership. You have leadership by consensus, individuals that are moving together very incrementally. They’re very cautious. They understand the importance of the stakes they are playing for. The one thing that you will not do well is go after your own intrinsic interests. The state-owned enterprises that are providing you money -- that’s where the inefficiencies are going to be as labor gets more expensive. That’s where the inefficiency will be when the United States and other Western multinationals stop giving them technology to rip off. Another problem with Chinese state capitalism is it creates enemies, you know. There are a lot of folks around Asia. They see the Chinese economic miracle, but they’re begging the United States to maintain a presence. Why? Because China does capitalism better than the United States? I don’t think so. We got to watch what people do, not what people say, what they do. Did you see that piece in the Wall Street Journal, talked about the disposition of Chinese millionaires, how over 50 percent of Chinese millionaires say they prefer to live in the United States than China? And yeah, it’s about quality of life. Yeah, it’s about the environment. Yeah, it’s about opportunities for their kids. It’s also about no rule of law in China and worrying about corruption and the sanctity of their assets over the long term. Your assets are okay tomorrow. The United States, we’re over-litigious. China doesn’t have that problem. You don’t have to worry about lawyers in China. You have to worry about someone ripping off your stuff or being forced out of the country or not being heard from again. Now, maybe Peter believes that those 50-plus percent of Chinese millionaires are stupid. Because ultimately, the United States is in decline, and so they shouldn’t be coming here, in which case, fine, but then China’s millionaires aren’t that bright. And those are the entrepreneurs, so we shouldn’t bet on them either way. You’re in a catch-22, sir. You know, I’m interested in what the Chinese do with their money. I understand that the Chinese are saying that they don’t like the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, but where are they putting their cash? In the U.S. Now, Ron Paul and Peter say they shouldn’t do that, and then we’re in big trouble. Okay, well, when are they going to stop? Because I don’t believe the Chinese are stupid. For me, that’s not an interesting analytical model. For me, what’s interesting is presuming the Chinese understand their interests and they’re putting all that money into treasuries because they believe that’s safe over the long term. We are entering an environment of fear. We’re entering an environment of volatility. When things get more volatile, we don’t just bet on go-go-growth any more. We put our money under the mattresses. Central banks do that too. And in that environment, the world’s largest economy, also ultimately the most resilient, the United States of America. Thank you very much.  "

    "data":"Well, I find myself in the awkward position, being an American, deeply believing in this country and its ability to innovate and in its entrepreneurial powers, to defend a Marxist-Leninist economy. And I beg you to marshal every bit of scrutiny you can to my argument and please convince me I am wrong by voting against me at the end of this debate. I would say that the comparison between capitalism in the United States and China is as much divided by the fact that capitalism here has in many ways failed its promise. And there, in a very counterintuitive way, one we hardly have expected, the Chinese Communist Party has managed to graft on a certain kind of guerilla mobility under Leninist rigidity to make their system actually function in a way which I think all of us would agree, over the past three decades, has been quite extraordinary -- something none of us who were standing in the middle of Tiananmen Square of 1989 when there were a million people demonstrating there, thought could ever possibly happen. So, I think if we look at America, we find a country that is in quite a bit of psychological self-doubt at this particular moment. We find a country that has had much of its government, many of its leaders besieged by irrationality, religiosity, they don’t believe in evolution, they don’t believe in climate change, we cannot pass a simple measure in Congress to extend the national debt, which is not going to not happen. How can a government that is so paralyzed by its own inability to see reason, how can it be the custodian over that critical part of every economy that a government must preside over? This is not to say that we don’t venerate entrepreneurs, we don’t venerate innovation, and we don’t believe in a free economy. But let me read you just simply what Adam Smith had to say, the great patron saint of laissez faire capitalism. He said that when the security of the whole society is at stake, natural liberty of a few individuals which might endanger that security ought to be restrained by the laws of all governments, the most free as well as the most despotical. And I think it is precisely here that we have failed. And by doing so, we have lent a greater credence to this curious, cryptic, hybrid version of Leninist capital, which China has employed, to quite a bit of success, I would have to say. So let's quickly just look at what we see in China. I spoke of the psychological dimension of the problem in this country, and I think everybody in this room feels it. There is a sense of I think lassitude. At the same time, greed is quite a force lost in the land. There's a great deal of self deception at work. If you look at China, who's running the government in China now? They're all engineers. In many ways, the very things that we used to impute to China as a great weakness, namely, a over reliance on ideology, are now the very things that are hampering our own country, while China, governed by engineers and technocrats, tends to look at reason. There are no climate deniers in China. I have never spoken to a Chinese who doubted evolution. And yet the ranks of the American political houses of Congress are replete with these people, and they're making decisions which govern how we live and govern the American economy. China also has managed in a way that I think it deserves our esteem to combine the public with the private and to act when things need to be done. When a stimulus program needs to be enacted, they look at the facts and they enact it. Do you remember when we looked at five-year plans as quaint kind of throwbacks to some retrograde period of Stalinist economics? Well, I think the United States could do with a good five-year plan. We can't plan for three months ahead. We have no ability even to execute policy, much less long range policy. If you go to Washington, you find more and more people utterly despairing of writing policy documents. Why? Because nobody can do anything with them. I think this ability of China to martial facts rationally, to martial its resources and make policy and allocate capital where it needs to be allocated in times of crisis is something that our own country could learn from. I want to read a quick quote from Henny Sender from the Financial Times.  The combination of Chinese SOEs and debt from state owned banks is a powerful alliance that will increasingly resonate outside of China as well as within it.  I think that's an interesting statement from a paper that's basically a laissez faire capitalist paper. So finally I would say that we would do well not to assume that China has nothing to teach the United States. It may be that this system will not endure in the future. It has many structural weaknesses. But to date I would say it has been ascending while our own form of capitalism, replete with the weaknesses that you all well know, has been in a state of decline. And whether we have the ability to grab it at the last minute from its final collapse is a question which will remain for years to come.  "

    "data":"I'm not going to speak in Chinese. I think that the impression that China is doing capitalism better than the U.S. is understandable. That's because it's a very superficial impression. One reason why that impression is widespread is that China has been growing fast. But there's a reason China is growing fast. Low income countries tend to grow much faster than rich countries because they have much bigger growth potential. Just think of two things. Consumption of energy. Chinese consumption of energy is about one-fourth of the U.S. consumption. So the Chinese, if they consume more energy, they will grow a lot faster. The same with steel production. China consumes one-tenth of the steel that the average American consumes. So if they want to reach American consumption, they need to build a lot of steel plants, and that makes economic growth. So first of all, do not judge whether a country does capitalism better or worse by just looking at its growth numbers. Second is that when you compare the two countries, the U.S. and China, you have to look at facts. This presentation is nothing but man [spelled phonetically] the facts. So what are the facts? If you look at corporate profits, U.S. companies are far more profitable than Chinese companies. And that is to think that we can trust Chinese accounting. And then you look at tax collection. I have to disagree with Peter. He says the Chinese, they collect less taxes than U.S. The opposite is true. The U.S. government takes about federal/state, about 30 percent of GDP. The Chinese government collects 35 percent. But that’s not the end of the story. Because in the U.S., you actually get something back from the government in the form of Social Security, health care, Medicare, Medicaid. In China, you get very little back because the bulk of government taxes are spent on government consumption, administration. If you go to China and get treated to a 20-course meal, you think great, that’s Chinese hospitality. But don’t forget, it’s being paid for by Chinese taxpayers. Not in the USA. You do not get that kind of treatment when you go to Washington, D.C. And then you look at whether China’s growth is using less natural resources. And here the U.S. is three times more efficient as China. Because for every dollar of GDP produced in China, China has to consume three times more in terms of its natural resources, water, clean air, land. The U.S. in other words, is a lot more efficient. Then you look at international comparisons, and here we’re using third-party numbers. And here, China does not look nearly as good as the U.S. Corruption. There’s a NGO based in Berlin called Transparency International. It publishes every year, a global index called Corruption Perception index. This index, the U.S. is ranked 24th in terms of, as the least corrupt country in the world. China is ranked 75. So if you think our average politician in Washington is corrupt, wait until you meet a Chinese politician. Then you look at overall economic competitiveness because capitalism is known for its efficiency and competitiveness. Here, the U.S. is ranked not number one, number five. What about China? China is number 26. So way, way behind the U.S. Then you look at something like innovation ranking. The U.S. is number seven; China is 29. You look at ease of doing business. This is by the World Bank. Because, a real capitalist country should be one in which it is very easy to do business. Overall ranking for the U.S. is number four in the world. China is number 91. Then starting a business, U.S. is number 13; China is number 151. Getting credit, the U.S. is number four; China is number 67. The list goes on and on and I don’t want to bore you. Finally, I want to imagine, what will the politburo members think about this debate? If for some reason, they’ve learned that in New York City, they’re debating whether China does capitalism better than the U.S. I think their first reaction is not to laugh. Then the second reaction, they say the Americans are really easy to impress. You stage an Olympics. They think China is number one. You build the world’s largest high-speed rail at enormous cost. They think the U.S. is falling behind. Then you lend the Americans $2 trillion. They think, China is definitely number one. So, the third thought that would come to their mind is that the Americans have very short memories, because when Sputnik was launched, everybody thought the Soviet Union was to dominate the world. And then in the late 1980s, I think in this city, people should have good memories about who was buying the Rockefeller Center, right. Japan was dominating the headlines. Everybody thought Japan was doing capitalism better than the U.S. Now, look at where Japan is after 20 years. So, I think what we’re seeing here is not that China does capitalism better than the U.S.; we are experiencing a period of self-doubt. I’m sure the real issue is not about China. The real issue is about the U.S. The U.S. can do capitalism much better than it does, but China, at least for the moment and for the foreseeable future, will not be doing capitalism anywhere better, anywhere close to the U.S. in terms of competition, efficiency, even social justice. Thank you. "

    "data":"Well, as you've just heard, America's in very difficult shape. And the difficult truth that we must face is that we are on the verge of an exploding public sector debt that can have a very, very negative effect on our economic future. As one cynic put it, our future isn't what it used to be. Social Security was born amid harsh times of the Great Depression, marked by unemployment, homelessness and even starvation. We then made a deal with the American workers, to wit, that nobody who paid into the system would be left empty handed. To this was added Medicare, health insurance in the mid 1960s and the protection against inflation in the 1970s. These initiatives changed the economics of old age. In a mere four decades, poverty rates among the elderly, which had been three or four times that of the general population, fell below the rates for younger Americans. To this day, social security still means the difference between poverty and economic security for millions of retirees, children and many American workers. It is the primary source of income for two-thirds of older Americans and the single most important antipoverty program for children, millions of whom live in households supported by disability, survivor or retiree beneficiaries. It creates intergenerational benefits as parents and grandparents can live independently of their working children and often become the childcare providers for children while the parents work. When Social Security began making monthly distributions in 1940, there were 160 workers for every senior receiving benefits. Today, there are about three workers. And within two decades, there will be two. Demographic are destiny. The message could not be clearer. Social Security needs fixing. It has been fixed before. Social Security taxes have been raised 40 times since the program began, most recently in 1983. The initial Social Security tax was two percent, split between the employer and the employee, capped at $3,000 of earnings, which made for a maximum tax of $60. Today the tax is approximately 13 percent, capped at $106,800 for a maximum of tax of $13,234, a multiple of 80 times the original tax. So what is to be done? Despite the natural sympathy for those looking forward to their retirement, we cannot avoid the issue of Social Security insolvency. Here are some options to deal with this problem, one, gradually raising the retirement age to reflect the longevity increases that have already taken place. In the future, retirement age should be indexed automatically to rise with longevity. Two, raising employer and employee payroll taxes by up to one percent each. Three, eliminating or gradually raising the cap on taxable payroll income, reflecting the fact that higher incomes are rising faster than the Social Security taxable earnings. Four, increasing the earliest eligible age, EEA, as it's called, from 62 to 65, which alone would extend the trust fund solvency by about five years. Current retirees would be unaffected. And exceptions would be made for Americans who cannot work longer due to injury, ill health, or other causes. Modest reductions in benefits for wealthier recipients should also be considered. We must address these challenges soon or Grandma's welfare will in fact undermine the quality of life for her grandchildren and give meaning to the phrase which my partner and I have found out, we'll both, quote,  Blessed are the young for they shall inherit the national debt.  I might add -- -- that was originally stated by my partner's grandfather. The greatest risk facing America's fiscal future comes from the projected increases in Medicaid and Medicare spending that could raise the deficits dramatically in the next couple of decades. Arithmetic still matters. Medicaid now pays for both health and long term care for roughly 55 million Americans. It finances more than one third of all births in the United States, and pays the cost of almost two thirds of the people in nursing homes. The federal government underwrites 50 to 77 percent of the cost, depending on the income level of each state. Even so, Medicaid is the second biggest and fastest growing category of state spending. Costs are up more than 60 percent in the last five years and are expected to exceed $450 billion this year and to keep growing by about eight percent annually for the next decade. In the next -- by the mid-1930s -- 2030s, the 65 and over population will nearly double, and health care costs, which have been rising far faster than worker productivity since the end of World War II, may be completely out of control, resulting in a tidal wave of federal spending. The basic fact is that the first baby boomer statistically retired on January 1 of this year, but there are 79 million more of them. Multiply that by estimated annual benefits of $40,000 that they will be receiving, and you're looking at $3 trillion a year just for that portion of the population. Erskine Bowles, the co-chair of the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission, put it well,  This is a fiscal crisis that is completely predictable and from which there is no escape. This concern has been shared by many, many institutions, the Post, the Washington Post, the Fed chairman, Bernanke, and countless others. Now, the only way to cut entitlement costs is to cut entitlement costs. The current programs as they play out will be unsustainable without giant tax increases or huge cuts in other government programs. We should remember as we address this problem that less is enough if it comes earlier, so the sooner the better. Now, this is a nation founded on opportunity, not entitlement, on thrift, not conspicuous consumption, on stewardship and not living for today, but taking steps to make sure that we are creating a better tomorrow, such that future generations would have as much or more opportunity and a better standard of living. To keep these entitlements under fiscal control is about keeping the American dream alive. I know the American dream because I'm one of the people who was attracted to this country many years ago from Canada where 50 percent of the graduating class of American universities moved to the United States, attracted as we were by the remarkable energy and optimism and mobility and upward mobility of this country, not to mention the president, John Kennedy. Today it is Canada's government that has shown best how to manage these kinds of problems as they work their way through perilous economic times without threatening its future. But much as I like Canada, I don't want my children moving there because of the narrowing of opportunity at home.  "

    "data":"Now I have a lot to correct in what Mort said, not least of which is why he came to the U.S. Canada is very cold. I’m delighted to be here with Mort Zuckerman, Margaret Hoover, and, of course, doctor, governor, and chairman, Howard Dean. I’m especially delighted to be here to defend Social Security and Medicare. They are two of the greatest achievements of any kind made in America. Mort’s listed -- Please. Mort’s listed why Social Security is so important, how many elderly it keeps out of poverty. It accounts for 80 percent of 40 percent of those who are elderly. It can account for well more than half of half of those who are elderly’s income. Medicare -- think of what the elderly would be doing without Medicare. How could they possibly be paying $12,000 and $15,000 a year for health insurance? But you know some of this. And you’re going to say, well, let’s cut them back a little bit for the sake of fiscal responsibility. I’m going to go into that in some detail. But let me remind you and let me make this very clear. Social Security and Medicare are not outrageously generous programs. The average Social Security payment is $14,000. Poverty for two -- a poverty line for two is $13,000. Medicare -- a typical employer-sponsored health plan will cover 88 percent of health needs. Medicare, according to independent actuarial studies, will cover 76 percent of Medicare. Big deductibles, big co-payments, not a gift. The elderly are not living wonderful lives because of Social Security and Medicare. If they’re living wonderful lives, it’s because they made a fortune, coming from Canada to America. Let me get to the point. Let me cut to the chase, because I had a lot to precede this. Let’s be very clear about what Social Security adds to our future debt. In fact, let me step back a moment. Social Security and Medicare have nothing to do with the current levels of debt -- nothing to do with it. The current levels of debt are a function of the great recession brought on, in my view, mostly due to the excesses of Wall Street, the Bush tax cuts in the early 2000s and the spending on the Iraq and Afghanistan War. Medicare Part D contributed some but less than any one of those three factors. We don’t have debt because of Social Security and Medicare. But what about the future? You would think, given what Mort says, that Social Security accounts for about half of what’s going to happen to us. What do you think the benefits of Social Security as a proportion of GDP are going to rise to, as a proportion of our total income? They’re now about five percent of our total income. They’re going to rise to a maximum of six percent of our total income, one percent of GDP. You think we can’t afford that? You think Social Security is going insolvent on the basis of that? And you know what? Even if we don’t raise taxes to cover Social Security, Social Security is not going insolvent. The Social Security Administration and the CBO make a forecast. It is a conservative forecast of economic growth. Even if we do nothing -- and if I leave one message with you, it should be this one -- if we do nothing, we will still have 78 percent of our benefits paid by the current system. Medicare is a different story. But Medicare spending is not going up in the next 10 years significantly as a proportion of GDP. It's going up after that. And why we hear a lot of alarmist talk about the aging of the population, true, there will be more aging compared to workers. Workers will have a harder time paying for the aged. But that's not what's driving Medicare costs up. That's not what's going to drive it sky high. It's the health care system, an inefficient health care system. And I'm going to leave that to my partner, Dr. Dean to discuss, how inefficient it is. Summarizing quickly on those two issues, we can handle Social Security easily. It is not going insolvent. That is inflammatory, misleading and incorrect rhetoric. Yes, I'm getting a little upset. I think I have cause. We still pay 78 percent of liabilities. Even if we do nothing, what can we do? We can raise the cap, as Mort suggested. We can raise the payroll taxes somewhat, 0.1 percent a year to 7.2 percent. And you know what? All the studies, all the surveys say people want to do that. Medicare, we have to reform health care. And I hope Mort, Margaret and Governor Dean put all their effort into reforming health care because is what can undo America, not these entitlement programs. One last major point. We are a low taxed nation. We are almost the lowest taxed nation in the OECD of all rich nations. Federal income tax comes to only 15 percent of GDP these days. Used to come to 20 percent when George W. Bush took office. Can we raise taxes? You bet we can. Ah, somebody's going to say from the other side. But that will slow economic growth. I leave you with one fact in my last 39 seconds. George W. Bush cut taxes sharply in 2001 and 2003. He promised growth, and he promised jobs. And all those people who talk about the poor job creators whose taxes we have to cut, consider this: We have the slowest rate of GDP growth after the Bush tax cuts from trough to peak. I mean before the devastation of late 2007 and the great recession, the slowest rate of GDP growth, 2001 to 2007 in any comparable period in post-World War II history. And job growth was even worse, almost no jobs were created after the Bush tax cuts. "

    "data":"Thank you, John, and thanks to Bob Rosenkranz for the opportunity to participate here tonight on a stage with such distinguished public figures. I am well aware that I am the junior on this stage. And as such, I will argue in favor of this motion from the perspective of Junior whose future is imperiled by Grandma's benefits. The juniors in this argument are the millennials. This is the rising generation in America, 30 and unders, born at beginning of the Reagan era to the end of the Clinton presidency. At 33 years of age, I am on the cusp of this rising generation and have been paying into Social Security and Medicare for eight years. I am told that as long as I pay into the system, this system will be there for me. By the time I reach my full retirement age of 67, 34 years from now in 2045, I'll expect to receive the same benefits equal to that which I paid into the system. And if I have planned on this, I will find my future severely imperiled. Because eight years before I retire, the Social Security trust fund will have been depleted. I will be surprised to discover that this trust fund was actually a myth, that it was in fact just a surplus of IOUs that had been lent out to other agencies of government to pay for their expanding programs. Beginning in 2037, Social Security will have to rely solely on the revenues from payroll taxes, which will be insufficient to cover the benefits promised to me and my generation. In addition, under current law, because of program insolvency, benefits will have to be cut by 23 percent or payroll taxes raised 30 percent. This sudden adjustment imperils the millennials economic future, affecting the poorest of those who are already dependent upon benefits. The rude awakening is that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid were set up as pay as you go -- they were never set up as trust funds. They are pay as you go programs. The federal government does not and never has saved payroll tax revenues. These have always been generational transfer programs from workers to retirees, such that the benefits for Grandma come directly out of the pockets of Junior. By the time the first millennials reach their 40s in 2021, the cost of Medicare alone will be greater than our country's total defense spending. Put all together with baby boomers hitting retirement, grandmas living longer, medical costs spiraling upwards, Social Security, Medicare expenses will consume about 12 percent of the nation's economic output in 2035, triple what it was in 1971. I would be remiss also if I didn't mention what we all know, which is that large parts of the federal budget are being financed by debt, 42 cents on every dollar. And this debt, too, must be paid back. By 2021, interest payments on the debt will be a bigger portion of the budget than our discretionary funding, which will contribute to a crowding out of spending in education, infrastructure, national defense and everything else that might be considered investment in our future. We all know this is unsustainable. And the need for reform is obvious. This is not an appropriate legacy for Grandma to leave to Junior because it defies the social contract in which each generation strives to leave the country better off than it inherited it from its parents. We need to revise the social contract to reflect the changes in our society in a way that keeps the faith with Grandma, does not cut her benefits on which she is now relying, but stops making promises to Junior that we simply cannot keep. We can have a generous, compassionate social welfare program for the elderly which is consistent with a dynamic economy in which workers have multiple employers over their careers, stay active and healthy in the work force into their 70s. This will require removing disincentives to longer careers, asking the more successful to shoulder more of their own retirement costs and health costs, and building stronger incentives for innovation and efficiency into our health system. Change is coming one way or the other, and it will either be deliberate, careful and well thought out, or it will be imposed by a chaotic and indiscriminate way. If we take it upon ourselves to correct the -- America's social contract and be proactive, there will be nothing to fear from these changes. This is the normal process of each generation of Americans, improving upon the strong institutions built by earlier generations. And the millennial generations, the juniors of tonight's motion, want to be part of that solution. You are likely to hear from our opponents an unwavering commitment to early 20th century social insurance models and an inability to adapt them and their spirit to the 21st century economy and population. They may accuse us of trying to take Grandma's benefits away from her or suggest that we believe that the federal safety net with a mistake in the first place. This is not true. The only people who are talking about taking away Grandma's benefits are those who want to scare seniors for political reasons. They may argue as well that entitlements, the benefits about which we are debating tonight, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, are not the problem at all, that the real problem for Junior is skyrocketing health care costs. This is a tricky tactic intended to shift the focus of the debate. Health care reforms are an important subject, just not the subject of tonight's debate. The system that pays Grandma's benefits is imperiling Junior's future by making promises to Junior that it cannot keep, by paying for these benefits through borrowing that contributes to mounting national debt, 14 trillion and counting, thus imperiling Junior's fiscal and economic future. We encourage you to vote in favor of the motion. "

    "data":"Thank you. First of all, I hope to be able to match Margaret. She actually stuck to the time and that's not so easy. She also did something else that is -- that you all have been victimized by for some time and that is frame the debate in such a way that we're focused on giving people big tax cuts at the same time we're focused on cutting benefits. The truth is that we do not have a Medicare and Social Security problem in terms of what it is costing us. What we have is bad management, politicians who won't talk to each other and work with each other, lousy tax policy, selfishness as a public policy, and growing inequality in America. This is not an issue about taxes. So a few facts, Social Security is in fact a trust fund. There are $2.6 trillion in the tax fund. They are invested in treasuries in the Social Security fund. By 2020 there will be $3.5 trillion in the Social Security trust fund set aside, put aside by you for spending by you. Is there a shortfall in Social Security? Yes. Is that the single biggest problem of our deficit? No. You know the single largest factor in our national debt is? This is the CBO, this is not some leftwing democratic think tank like MSNBC.  Sixty percent of the deficit in 2019 is due solely to the Bush tax cuts, 60 percent. Now, that's a fact, I'm not -- if you don't want to raise taxes, be my guest, but if this is a debate between raising taxes and dealing with Social Security, you should know that because these neither of these problems is the big problem, the problem is not Social Security. I agree with Mort, there are a lot of things you can do about this. Margaret mentioned some good things you can do about Social Security. We have to tweak Social Security, yes, it's not a big problem. Medicare, Medicare is not the problem. Its costs are out of control. There's a reason for that. The costs of the entire health care system in the United States of America are out of control. There's no way you're going to control Medicare costs without doing something about the rest of the health care costs, and that means we have to have real health care reform, which we have not had. And the real health care reform has not taken place either under Romney Care/Obama Care or whatever the Republicans want to call it these days, it has not taken place because the entire reimbursement system of the health care, Medicare, or private sector, encourages me to do as much as I can to you whether it works or not, and the more I do, the more I get paid. We need to fundamentally get rid of the fee for service system, capitated care, some of the things in the health care bill such as accountable [spelled phonetically] care organizations, vertically integrated care, will solve the Medicare problem, period. We do not need to privatize either one of those programs. And for those of you on Social Security, could you imagine if President Bush had has his way and we'd privatized Social Security shortly before 2008, I don't think many of you would have been able to afford the $40 ticket that you paid to get in here. So let us not allow the right wing to focus on these two programs or the idea that we ought to reform them. Let's reform our tax system so we have a more equal more fair society and then we can talk about how to deal with these systems. Now, what can, in fact, we do? We talked a little bit about how to fix Medicare. We do need to start paying people in a global budget, pay the hospitals and the doctors a flat fee for taking care of people. Then, all of a sudden, guess what? Prevention will pay. Nobody invests in prevention today except for Kaiser or self-insured major corporations. We can change all of that. There need to be some reforms, but we do not need to make this a private system, and we do not need to withdraw government support from this system. We don’t even need to reduce benefits. We do need to change the way we pay for health care, not just to save Medicare and older people. We need to save business by doing this. We need to save individuals by doing this. We fundamentally have to reform health care. Let’s not use Medicare and Social Security as the victim. The fact of the matter is that young people inevitably are going to end up as my age. And when they do, they’re not going to want these programs to disappear. The elderly used to be the poorest group in American until in 1926 the farm states where the Depression started began Social Security, which has then spread to a national program by Roosevelt in 1933. So this is a core program. We just need to make it work and we just need some mild tweaks. Health care needs a lot of tweaks, but the whole system needs tweaks, not simply Medicare. And we should stop victimizing Medicare for the sake of keeping our taxes absurdly low. The fact is people need to pay their fair share in America, and the Bush tax cuts need to sunset. You know, when the taxes were at Bill Clinton’s rate, the economy was a whole lot better than it is now. And I wouldn’t mind going back to those taxes and paying my fair share at all. In conclusion, the solution to this problem is not to return the elderly to poverty. The elderly programs do not harm young people in this country, because if we did not have them, you would be living with them so you could take care of them at the same time as you tried to make your own lives. These programs were put in for a reason. It is a social compact. And I’ll close with the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes. Taxes are the price we pay for civilization. And for those who continue to want to avoid them more and more, seeking tax cuts when we already have enormous deficits, you will end up paying the price, because -- and I say this not as somebody who’s a liberal or on the left. I say this as a social observer. There is no society on the face of the earth now or in the past which has not collapsed when the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest in that society has become too big. We are going down a very dangerous road. And cutting Medicare and Social Security are the last things we should be doing, not the first. "

And there are three broad areas of policy effort here, first is the effort to shore up to the financial system, and this is everything from what the FDIC has done, increasing deposit insurance limits, to guaranteeing bank debt to allow the banks to issue, to efforts by the Treasury to help facilitate all the things that the Federal Reserve Board has been doing to try to provide credit to the financial system and stabilize the financial system. Perhaps the most important thing in my mind with regard to the effort to shore up the financial system, was the banks’ stress tests--do you remember the stress test, this was done back earlier this year. And to me, those stress tests were the modern-day equivalent of what FDR did back in the Great Depression, he— I’m going to exaggerate just a little bit but only a little bit. He closed all the banks on a Friday and he said on the subsequent Monday to his Treasury Secretary, open all of them except a couple hundred of them and the Treasury Secretary said to him, well, which ones should I open, and FDR said, well, it really doesn’t matter because the ones you open, everything will think are safe, and life will go on and—In fact it worked, it restored confidence and that was the beginning of the end of the Great Depression and the stress test in fact did that, it restored confidence and the financial system is stable. The second blotter of the policy response was to shore up the two weakest parts of our economy, the housing market and the auto market. I’m not going to spend much time on the auto market because Steve is so intimately involved in that great effort, and he’ll talk about that, but I know housing, and the efforts to shore up the housing market have been quite amazing, and just to name a few things. The first-time homebuyer tax credit, very important in stabilizing housing values this summer, to help to support buying by first-time home buyers, the loan modification plan to help homeowners who are facing foreclosure, to get their monthly mortgage payments down so that they can afford their, their mortgage payment. Efforts to provide more credit to the residential mortgage market through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and FHA. Here’s a statistic for you. 90 percent of all the residential mortgage loans being made today are being made by the federal government, so if the federal government wasn’t making those loans, the housing market would be in complete disarray and we’d be in very significant trouble, so the second broad policy effort was to help shore up those two key sectors, the two weakest sectors of our economy. And the third policy response, broadly speaking, is the fiscal stimulus, much maligned, but ultimately at the end of the day, very successful. I don’t think it’s any accident that the recession came to an end, at the same time that the stimulus was providing its maximum economic benefit to the economy. And the stimulus is lots of things, it’s aid to unemployed workers, it’s helped the state governments, it’s the first-time homebuyer tax credit, it’s Cash for Clunkers, a long list of things, the infrastructure spending, all very important. So, please remember, point number one, that the policy effort is a range of many things, it’s been incredibly— it’s amassing and incredibly unprecedented what has been done here, and key to bringing an end to this Great Recession. Point number two, here are the statistics I think are overwhelming. A year ago, think about a year ago, what was going on, major financial institutions were evaporating or being nationalized, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman, Bear, AIG, Citigroup was on the doorstep of falling apart, and look at the situation today. The financial system is not normal, no, but it is stable. And banks aren’t lending to us yet as business people and as consumers but they’re moving in that direction, and just imagine where we’d be today without that stability in the financial system. Think about the economic statistics, housing activity, new and existing single-family housing starts hit a low in January, housing construction hit a low in January, back at the beginning of the year, housing values were falling very rapidly, today, the last couple of quarters they’ve actually begun to increase. GDP, the value of all the things that we produce as an economy, grew 3.5 percent in the third quarter and the growth was very broadbased, that was the first substantive growth in over a year and a half. And clearly driving the economy forward, the GDP in the fourth quarter, the current quarter, is on track to be positive again. The job market. Last thing to improve, but it is improving, we’re moving in the right direction. We—just to give you a statistic, at the beginning of the year, we were losing 700,000 jobs on average every single month. In the last three months we lost 200,000 jobs a month, now I know, that’s a lot of jobs, unemployment is still rising. But the trend lines are right, they’re moving in the right direction and my view is by early next year, we will have a stable job market, and by the end of next year, we will have job growth that’s meaningful enough to bring down the rate of unemployment, so everything is moving in the right direction. Finally, point number three, I said there were three points… The proposition is, “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” It’s not, they have worked. This is not a mission accomplished, no one is arguing that this is over and done with, we have more work to do, and the administration is still working. Just last week, they passed another piece of legislation to help extend unemployment insurance benefits for people who lose their jobs in 2009, now if you become unemployed in 2009 you have 99 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits, they extended, and they expanded the firsttime homebuyer tax credit into next year to provide support to the housing market, and they’ve provided a number of other supports. They are debating right now and will likely pass other efforts to shore up the economy, extend some of the other provisions in the stimulus to make sure that the stimulus provides benefit to the economy as we make our way into 2010. And more importantly and perhaps most importantly, we are working through some of the structural problems in our economy, working on the hard, difficult issues, the most obvious would be financial regulatory reform. Now this is something you don’t want to do quickly, you don’t want to make a mistake. Our financial regulatory structure has been in place since the Great Depression. It feels like it, and we have got to take time to make it right. So, in my view, what the administration has done has been highly successful."

    "data":"Thank you very much. The question before the house may appear political. But it in fact is not. One person on our panel  as you’ve heard, shifted his position to argue our side. Two of us, supported President Obama in the last election and all three of us hope that he will succeed. The question is about the economy, it is about whether the economic program is working effectively. Lawrence Summers, the Chief Economic Advisor to the President, told the Washington Post on November 8th, quote,  I think we got the Recovery Act right. The primary objective of our policy is having more work done, more product produced, and more people earning more income.” We agree with that standard. The economy is not performing up to that standard. Basically, if you leave aside the actions some of which Mark mentioned such as the extension of deposit insurance by the FDIC, that were taken under the Bush administration, the Obama economic program…the principal points are two. One is the Recovery Act, the stimulus bill, and the other is the policy of providing free reserves, credit at zero interest rate, to the banking system in the hopes that credit will flow again. So the question before us is, was the stimulus sufficient, and secondly, is credit flowing again. Now the stimulus did some good things, it helped forestall the complete collapse of budgets in the state and local government sector, it created some construction jobs and will create more. It has provided some tax relief. The question is, is it enough. I think it is pretty clear, that it was not enough. The stimulus was enacted based on a forecast that unemployment would not rise past about 8 percent by the middle of this year, would decline thereafter, that forecast was clearly wildly optimistic. It underestimated the state and local crisis where job cuts, or, just offsetting, the jobs created with federal funds. It did too little too late to meet the foreclosure crisis which is presently running at several million homes a year. Let me quote a distinguished economist. On November 6th, 2009, he wrote,  After rising for more than two and a half years the country’s unemployment rate crossed into double-digit territory in October, with a jobless rate of 10.2 percent. This provides another sign of the severity of the current downturn, the very long road we face back to full employment, and the urgent need for more policy action to create jobs and protect those who can’t find work. With such a huge fire, we need every hose we can find to put it out.” I agree with that. There is an urgent need for more policy action. Who said it? Why, Larry Mishel, President of the Economic Policy Institute said it just 10 days ago. What you said… if you say this, that you also agree with Larry Summers, that the Recovery Act got it right. Now I am not an economic forecaster. But there are forecasters I greatly respect, and here is what one of them testified to Congress, on October 29th.  It is growing clear,” he said,  that more policy help will be needed to ensure that the tentative recovery evolves into a self-sustaining expansion. Although a double-dip downturn is less than likely, meaningful threats to the recovery still exist. Most notable, are the intensifying stresses in the job market, the ongoing foreclosure crisis, the boom and bust in the commercial real estate market the dysfunctional structured finance market and the fiscal woes of state and local governments.” Quite an impressive list and I hesitate to say this in a theater but it sounds like other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play. To go on,  Congress must provide more resources to unemployed workers, whose benefits are running out, to state and local governments unable to balance their budgets and to household and businesses looking to buy homes and invest.” I agree with that. Congress must provide more resources. Who said it. Why, Mark Zandi said it, founder of Moody’s Economy.com, just two weeks ago. Would you say this, if you agreed with Larry Summers, that the Recovery Act got it right. Now it’s true, free money has saved the banks, everyone knows this, from their profit reports and their bonuses. The stock market has come back and so has the price of oil. Is this enough? We think not. We think the housing crisis is important, we think the collapse of small business is important, we think 10 percent unemployment as far as the eye can see is a disaster. We know as every business in America knows that credit is not flowing again. What would a working program look like. First it would dissolve rather than coddle the toxic banks. It would stop the displacement of people from their homes, not just slow it, not just help a few, but stop the displacement of people from their homes. It would help all their workers who are ready to leave their jobs, to retire by providing them with a more comfortable employment, and health care that they can count on at an earlier age than 65, opening up places for younger people who are looking for jobs in today’s catastrophic labor market. And it would fund a lot of new green jobs, all across the country, providing every American who wants a chance to work, for the duration, until the private sector comes back, revives and is able to take up the slack. On our side, we don’t agree, on all of the issues. But on the issues just outlined and I submit they are the essential issues, the facts are plain. Better than nothing is not good enough. There was a poll…released just a few days ago on November 6th, which stated that 47 percent of Americans think that the economy is still the most important issue, that’s against all the other issues that might be considered. The American people know what this is about. They do not think that the program is working effectively, and that is surely telling. If it were working effectively, they would know. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Well, I hope I get invited to the next official state dinner then  You know, as an economist, over my career I’ve been focused on what are the living standards of the American people, the working class. How they’ve done, and so what has mattered to me most on economic policy, is in fact, what have we done to create jobs, to get the unemployment rate down. And so I’m going to focus on the Recovery Act. And I’m here to say that I think it has actually been a bold and effective act. No, it has not solved all our economic problems. It has not solved the unemployment problem. That is not quite the standard that you should imagine, for judging whether the policies are effective. Let me just say—my imagery for all this. President Obama inherited a really large apartment building, it was all aflame, afire. He gathered all the fire trucks and hoses he could, and he put out the flames, in at least half the floors. But the critics say, look, there’s still fire and so your policies must be wrong. And especially, it turns out, these critics are the conservatives who actually lit the darn fire. And they tried to keep the fire hoses from actually getting to the fire building.I think it’s actually quite outrageous. Now it’s a somewhat different— I think it’s somewhat different to my longtime, I don’t have any old friends, only have longtime friends, Jamie Galbraith. But we’ll get around to that. So let me talk at first about what the fire was. Mark talked about it. Over the nine months that included the last half of 2008 and the first three months of 2009, none of which were the responsibility of President Obama, okay, we had the fastest decline in the economy, basically since they started collecting the data in 1947 on a quarterly basis. We had already seen six million jobs lost by March 2009. The unemployment rate was already 8.5 percent, which is the highest it was since the great, really deep recession of the early 1980s. So we were in deep…you know what. And so we had the Recovery Act which was passed very quickly and effectively, actually started having some effect in March, but mostly started having an effect in April. And I want to go through exactly what it does, so it’s not an abstraction. What are the different components. First as Mark mentioned, support to the unemployed, and helping them not only with unemployment benefits and higher benefits, extended benefits, and health care, and a major increase in food stamps. Why does that matter. By supporting their incomes and their spending it creates jobs, throughout the economy. Secondly. There was a major influx of money to state governments, who, by resolving their own deficits when they have to cut programs and raise taxes, they actually--what Paul Krugman said is they are like 50 little Herbert Hoovers. They are driving us into recession, by actually exacerbating the problem. Okay. When you give them the money, they don’t cut the programs, they keep the people that work for them in the local government’s employ. To keep the contractors and the private sector delivering construction contracts, health care, nursing homes, et cetera, employed, and by all those people being employed through spending money they keep jobs going throughout the economy. Okay, there’s also a third, a tax cut that was in effect in April, everybody’s withholding on their W-2’s, was actually increased, providing more income, more money to spend. Last there was some government spending in infrastructure that started going out. But the main infrastructure spending, actually is scheduled for 2010. That’s when we get the energy alternatives, that’s when we get more infrastructure, and other things that are going to create productivity in the long run as well as create jobs. What has been the effect of all this spending? Well as Mark said, over the last six months, we’ve actually seen a much different outcome than what was projected in the springtime, the economy shrank by a little bit, it would’ve shrunk by around 4 percent, but it actually shrank by a little bit less than 1 percent. In the summer the economy actually grew. Now, as someone dedicated to raising the living standards of the entire broad middle class, who’s satisfied with that, I’m not satisfied with that, okay? But the question is, are you going to judge the Obama administration policy ineffective, because it hasn’t corrected what I think is 30 years of generating inequality, false-hearted, silly deregulation and worshipping of markets where we shouldn’t have done it that got us into this darn mess? I don’t think that’s quite appropriate. Thank you—don’t take my time. Um—We calculate that the Recovery Act has actually created anywhere between 1.1 to 1.5 million jobs by the end of September. I’m not satisfied that the job losses are 200,000 rather than 700,000, but I think it’s quite great. I’m very worried about the fact that unemployment is going to be high for many years to come, too high. I don’t blame that on President Obama, I blame that on the bums that put us in this mess. And you should too. Now, it’s true that the unemployment rate is higher than what the administration said it was going to be. They said if we did the Recovery Act it was going to only get to 8 percent. Well, let me mention something. The unemployment rate in March, before the Recovery Act even had an effect was already 8.5 percent. Now I did tell my friends in the White House, that’s a silly thing, don’t project like that. You shouldn’t do that, you’re going to get caught by that, and in fact, they have been hung by their own petard so to speak. But the fact is that, let me tell you that this is not a policy failure. This is a failure of my profession, economists. If you look at what economists projected right at the time of the election, the bluechip forecasts, and look at that same period I told you about, the nine months that includes the last half of last year and the first three months of this year. Now they’re already halfway through that period. And they were saying that the economy was going to shrink at a 1.5 percent rate, over that nine-month period. And it actually shrank by three times that much. So the fact is, what the administration got wrong in its forecast was it didn’t have a right sense of what things were going to be without the policy. I think they got the policy right, the policy’s had a substantial impact. Now has it solved all our problems, the fact is I’m not so sure how much more could’ve been done, economically. I can darn well tell you that politically, there was not much more on the table that they could get. What was put through the House and was put through the Senate, what was stopped, is some people that were in the Senate, who are known as moderates which just means they want to do a little bit less of what everybody else And thank you very much."

    "data":"I’m here to talk about the Obama policy, not about apartment house fires. The policy has had a mixed result. There’re some small positive effects. But, there are five reasons for concluding the policies are not working effectively. First, the forecast was that $780 billion would be spent, the maximum unemployment rate would be 8 percent. Second, it’s now 10.2 percent, continuing to rise, that’s a failure. The second, is the administration recognition that the policy has failed. If the policy had succeeded, they would not be talking about another stimulus program, it recognizes, that talk recognizes, that the stimulus was not effective. That their policies have, so far, been very weak. Third, the administration invented something called  jobs saved.” You can search economic textbooks from now to the end of time, you will not find something called  jobs saved.” Jobs saved, how do you know if you job is saved. Sure, it was true that, if we paid the states to have a smaller deficit, they didn’t fire quite so many teachers. But, we also shifted the deficit, to the federal government, with higher future tax rates that are going to have to pay for those, over the long term. This administration has failed on the main thing that it needs to do, which is to tell us, how are we going to get out of this mess. The composition of the stimulus is the fourth problem. That was decided in the Congress. It was a mistake by the Obama administration to let it be decided in the Congress, because the Congress was interested much more in the redistribution of wealth than it was in seeing jobs and the economy improved. One-third of the stimulus went to state and local governments, for their deficits. That may be good or bad policy, but it has ver y little stimulus. It simply transfers the deficit from one place to another. Also, a big piece of the stimulus went for a temporary tax cut. We’ve had lots of evidence on temporary tax cuts. The Bush administration, the Ford administration, policies have, so far, been very weak. Third, the administration invented something called  jobs saved.” You can search economic textbooks from now to the end of time, you will not find something called  jobs saved.” Jobs saved, how do you know if you job is saved.

One-third of the stimulus went to state and local governments, for their deficits. That may be good or bad policy, but it has very little stimulus. It simply transfers the deficit from one place to another. Also, a big piece of the stimulus went for a temporary tax cut. We’ve had lots of evidence on temporary tax cuts. The Bush administration, the Ford administration, we’ve had in the post-war period were the Kennedy-Johnson tax cuts, and the Reagan tax cuts. They were permanent tax cuts, people knew that once they got them, they were theirs. Finally fifth. This program is so off the block. Do you remember shovel-ready projects? Well, only 25 percent of the dollars for the infrastructure have been spent. Maybe that part of the program will do some good when it gets started, but the economy is in a slow recovery. So that part of the program is hardly a success. Now the economy has recovered, and the members of the affirmative tell us about how much better things are than they were a year ago. But is that a result of the Obama policy, or is it the natural tendency of the economy when it sinks, when inventories get very low, to be rebuilt, because that’s where a lot of the third-quarter improvement came from, the rebuilding of inventories. Very little of it in consumption. Most of the recovery in the third quarter came from temporary clunkers, and housing. The housing policy is full of corruption. People come in and ask for the $8,000, they send their children, because they’ve already bought a house, they send their children to do it, the Washington Post had a long expose of the corruption in the housing problem. I believe that we have the wrong policy. The problem for the United States for the future, the problem that we are all going to face for a long time to come, is that we have a huge debt, that a lot of, part of it is owed to foreigners, and it’s growing. So, you don’t have be to an academic economist to figure out that the way we’re going to pay for that is to export. And the way to export more, would be to invest more, and earn our way out of that problem. What the administration is doing is the wrong thing. It’s trying to build up consumption. Fortunately, it isn’t being very successful. Now the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, says we have a debate explosion. It’s unsustainable. It’s headed toward a debt crisis. The Congressional Budget Office says that every 10-point increase, percentage point increase in the debt ratio, lowers GDP growth by a quarter percent. This administration is increasing the debt by 50 percentage points. That’s a policy failure. The government debt to GDP ratio was about 50 percent, when the administration took office. The CBO trajectory says, it’s going to 700 percent. 700 percent is not a point we’re going to reach, because it’s unsustainable. That means, we’re headed, unless we do something about the exploding debt, we’re going to have a crisis. We absorb a considerable part of world savings, that too is unsustainable. Why. Well, the Bush drug bill. The Obama health care bill. A great many of the things that the Congress does, increase the deficit. You can’t believe, that we’re going to cut Medicare by $500 billion in order to get the drug bill passed. But that’s what you have to believe, if you believe that this administration is going to give you health care without paying We are on an unsustainable policy, and it’s a failed policy. Many years ago I started to tell people, capitalism without failure, is like religion without sin. Governor Spitzer’s going to talk about that in the context In the context…in the context of the banking system—"

    "data":"Well, my paternal grandparents, who were fur peddlers in Moscow, would be rather shocked at the idea that I was a Czar of any kind, so I will...I don’t have anything to follow Allan Meltzer’s last remark, I’m afraid...But I was struck listening to the first two speakers from the other side. I feel a little bit like Goldilocks. I heard one speaker that we in the Obama Administration were too hot and I heard one sort of imply we were too cold. And that makes me think we got it about right. All kidding aside, I actually do want to make a serious point. And with all due respect to the first two speakers from the other side, I want to try to take the ethereal world of theory and connect it to the real world of politics. Because I heard a few things that kind of, that did strike me. I heard Jamie say, Congress must provide more resources. We must resolve the toxic banks. We can’t let it be decided by Congress. Well, who else decides things besides Congress? We have to stop the displacement of people from their homes. I mean, these are all wonderful phrases but this is, as I found in my six months in Washington, not how the world works. As Rahm Emanuel said the other day, It’s fine to imagine yourself sitting under a shady tree at the Aspen Institute thinking of great policies. But then eventually you have to come to grips with the real world and deal with it. So you can say, people can say our stimulus program was not enough, but the fact is, as Larry said just at the end of his remarks, it was all Congress was going to pass. There was no more there. It took every ounce of political muscle that the administration had to get that. You can say it was too much but I think as Larry Summers has said many times, when you are facing a potential disaster you err on the side of doing more, not less. And they did as much as was possible. So I just want to try to again connect back to this sort of real world of politics and of getting things done that was really one of the biggest surprises that I found coming to Washington. We may all talk about the President and say, It’s the President’s decision. The President recommends this, the President does that. But there is a little thing called Congress that has to be dealt with as well and that becomes a series of gives and takes and judgments. And so when Jamie Galbraith says, All Obama did was two things: the stimulus program and the low interest rates—which actually wasn’t even Obama. That was the Federal Reserve—it’s really not fair. I think the Obama Administration – and we’ll talk more about autos in a minute—but this Financial Regulatory Reform which has been put forward, this energy which has been put forward, this health care which has been put forward, this housing which has been put forward—all these problems that were unattended to for the last eight years, this administration is trying its hardest to address in a thoughtful, responsible way. Let me turn for a minute now to the auto sector as well because I think my two fellow panelists made very, very coherent and logical and I hope ultimately persuasive cases for why the rest of the policy actions that the administration took were thoughtful. And so let me talk for a second about autos. Because it was an interesting area. It’s one of the few areas where the President actually did have authority. And so if you don’t like what the President did on autos, it’s fair to blame the administration for that because we didn’t have to go to Congress. We had TARP money. We didn’t have to deal with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, except in one fairly minor way. We were pretty free to act. And when we showed up we had a bunch of people from one side of the aisle saying, You’ve gotta let these companies fail. You’ve gotta let the market work. I’m sorry I don’t have any quotes from Jamie, but I did see one quote from Allan when I was poking around where, when Lehman Brothers went out of business Allan said, No big deal. It’s fine. That’s the way--you should have consequences from capitalism. That’s the way it should work. And then a year later he said Lehman Brothers should have been saved. And so we had a lot of people saying to us, Oh, just let the market work. Well, I hope the people whosaid, Let’s just let the market work, knew what that would have meant. It would have meant that Chrysler and GM would have shut down by the end of March. It would have meant that hundreds of suppliers would have gone out of business. They all would have liquidated. It would have meant that Ford would have stopped making cars because they wouldn’t have been able to get parts because their suppliers, many of them, would have been shut down. And you would have had something like three million people out of work, mostly in the industrial Midwest right at the end of March, right when the economy was at its worst. So it’s fine to say, Let’s let the market work. But again, let’s try to connect it back to the real world and what the real world consequences would be of letting that happen. Then you had some people, frankly, on the other side who basically said, You can’t let these companies go bankrupt. It would be catastrophic, it would be a disaster. Nobody would buy cars. They would eventually liquidate. You can’t possibly do that. But President Obama made the decision that we weren’t going to simply kick the can down the road, frankly, the way the previous administration had, and we were only going to inject money in the context of a fundamental restructuring that might have to include bankruptcy, which it ultimately did. And we achieved unprecedented sacrifices from all the stakeholders—from the lenders, from the UAW, from the suppliers, from the dealers, from everybody who was affected—came to the table and, frankly, with a fair amount of muscle from the administration, participated in this restructuring. And the result of that was that today General Motors announced their earnings. They’re still losing money but their performance was wildly better than anybody would have guessed. They have forty-two billion dollars of cash in the bank at the moment and they are performing well ahead of the expectations that we had. They’re out of bankruptcy. Chrysler is out of bankruptcy in alliance with Fiat. So I think it is a very vivid example of a place where we weren’t too hot, we weren’t too cold. We were very pragmatic. We addressed the problem, we focused on it and we tried to come up with the best solution for all concerned. And I think that that exercise, which I was proud to be a small part of, was emblematic of the approach that this administration has taken. Tim Geithner and Larry Summers, the two principal economic policy makers, have strong views of principle but they are experienced, they are pragmatic. They know how to get things done. They are balanced and they are very thoughtful. And I think that the approach that they have taken throughout this process has been enormously positive and has led to all the things that you heard Larry and Mark talk about in terms of bringing this country back from the abyss, bringing us back from a depression and getting us started down the road. Of course, I think it was—I forget who on the other side said—47 percent of people think the economy is the most important issue. Of course it’s the most important issue. But that doesn’t mean we haven’t made good progress. That doesn’t mean that disaster hasn’t been averted and those green shoots that people talk about have begun to sprout. So I was very proud to be a part of that and I would simply say to you, Would you prefer this administration or the last administration or some other administration? Because I think this administration has done awfully well."

    "data":"I'd certainly like to thank Intelligence Squared and the Richmond Center for an event on topic this important. My partner, Art Laffer, the eponymous economist, will follow with some great thoughts on why raising tax rates is the wrong place to start. But I just want to make two points this evening. First, raising tax rates on the rich is both counterproductive and unnecessary to fund the government that Americans have traditionally had. I'll come back to that point. Second, if we do want a larger government, and that's a political choice, the extra taxes to pay for that government will largely come from the non-rich. Now, let's start with how high tax rates are. If you look at survey data and ask Americans what they think is fair that about a quarter or a bit more would be fair in taxes paid. If that's true, the current and projected marginal tax rates -- that is the tax rate on the next dollar that you earn -- are very high for upper income folks, 35 percent for ordinary income. And, if you're New Yorkers in this audience, you know that by omitting state and local taxes, I'm leaving a lot on the table here. And 15 percent for dividends and capital gains, but of course corporate taxes were already paid there. And, on top of that, there's an estate tax that taxes money that had already been taxed once or twice in someone's lifetime. All of these taxes are set to rise substantially next year, 40 percent for earned income, 44 percent for dividends, 24 percent for capital gains, and beyond. Now, the calls for higher tax rates really raise two concerns. First, if you step back, they treat the nation's income as an already big pie, and it doesn't really matter for the size of that pie how it's sliced. An economic observation of that is that ignores a lot of incentives that taxes have on the decisions we all make. Those sorts of incentives would lead to lower activity, lower jobs, and lower incomes. The second choice here is that the real fiscal policy choice facing the nation is really about the size of government. And here my observation isn't economics, it's just arithmetic: if we want the larger government, we all will have to pay for it. The bulk of the taxes will come from the non-rich. Now, let's start, first, on the cost of raising tax rates. Now, I can look out and tell that your favorite course in college was, of course, economics, and you remember, from the public finance lecture in that class, you can boil it down to a simple sentence: if you tax something you get less of it. And economists worry, particularly, about tax rates that are already high. Now, some of the somethings we get less of are work and saving. And, here, I just want to offer you a forecast, and I should be honest with you that President Bush once said about me that  Glenn can't even forecast the past.  And I think what the president meant was data get revised, but you take that for what it's worth. But economists, like me, and my own academic research, have forecast changes in taxable income from changes in tax rates. The responses of high income tax payers are not only absolutely high, they are much higher than the responses of other tax payers. Of particular concern in this regard is the taxation of business income. High business taxes discourage investments in machines and ideas and jobs. More than half of Americans who work in the private sector work for businesses whose owner pay taxes at individual rates. Raising taxes on those business owners discourages hiring, discourages investment. If you make a comparison of next year's tax law, with higher rates, to the much bally-hooed Bowles-Simpson plan, you'd find that the lower tax rates in Bowles-Simpson that are financed by broadening the tax base, would raise investment in businesses by 54 percent, and raise hiring by 14 percent. And high tax rates don't necessarily produce revenue. The fact that revenue shares and GDP haven't varied substantially across periods when the top marginal rate was more than 70 percent, from when it was less than, or about, 28 percent, suggests that we have a lot of lost taxable income and a lot of wasteful tax planning when we have high tax times. The right answer is tax reform to raise money from upper income households by broadening the tax base, and to seek expenditure reform that also reduces benefits for those tax payers. Now, what about the larger government? Before the financial crisis, federal spending in the U.S. averaged about 20 percent of GDP for many decades. What if we decide we'd like a bigger government? Let's say 25 percent, or maybe a larger number, like many European countries. Shouldn't raising tax rates on the rich pay for that government? Well, the simple answer is no. Or, more accurately, it can't. If you look across the OECD, the club of rich industrial nations, you'll find something that may surprise some of you. The U.S. has the most progressive tax system. And, in fact, the U.S. tax system actually decreased inequality more than any other country's tax system. So you think to yourself,  Well, how can this be? We're thinking of European nations with large government and social welfare programs.  But the answer is simple, for reasons of arithmetic, that is, there's just not that much income at the top, and economics, consequences for investment and for jobs would be too grim, those nations actually use broad based consumption taxes, like a VAT that are borne by all citizens to fund their spending. So the real choice is the size of government. That's the debate we need to have first. Taxation should be fair, but it should also seek to advance growth and living standards. The right tax system for this country can accomplish both. And so, for the government of the size that we all have been used to before the past few years, we can, we should, accomplish both fairness and growth without raising tax rates on high income individuals. If we, the body politic, want a larger government, we all must pay. The rich are not a plug number in a budget gambit for a free lunch. For the proposition, The Rich Are Taxed Enough, the answer is clear, and it's yes. "

    "data":"Look. I think this is an absurd motion, and I urge you to vote against it when you have a chance to vote against it again. It's an absurd motion for the following reasons. Number one, we have a huge budget deficit. Even if we didn't want to expand the size of government, even if we want to contract the size of government, we still have a gigantic budget deficit. And the debt is about 85 percent, by some measures, of gross domestic product. And the question is how do you get the deficit down? How do you get the debt down? Well, almost everybody who has looked at the issue has said it's got to be some combination of tax increases and spending cuts. The Simpson-Bowles commission, to which my esteemed colleague referred to, said,  Well, we have one dollar of tax increases for every three dollars of spending cuts.  But there have got to be some tax increases, and the real question here isn't the size of government, the real question here is who is going to bear the brunt of the tax increases. Is it going to be people mostly at the top, or is it going to be people who are in the middle, or is it people who are poor? And I want to tell you in terms of common sense and logic and fairness, it ought to be people at the top. Why, why, why? You can applaud, but don't take away from my time. Why? Because number one, people at the top have never had it so good. I mean, the percentage of total income in this country going to people who are in the top one percent, has doubled over the past 30 years. It used to be 10 percent back in 1980. It's now over 20 percent. That is people in the top 1 percent are now getting over 20 percent of total income. If you're in the top one tenth of 1 percent, your share didn't just double, it actually tripled over the last 30 years. If you're in the top one-one-hundredth of 1 percent, your share quadrupled of total income over the last 30 years. The richest 400 Americans have more wealth than the bottom 150 million of us put together. And this kind of asymmetry, this kind of distorted gap between the top and the wealthiest people and everybody else is really something new in this country, at least within people's living memory. It wasn't this way in the '50s or '60s or '70s. It wasn't even nearly this way in the '80s. So, if we're going to have to raise taxes, obviously fairness and logic would indicate you raise them on the top. Now, Glenn Hubbard is talking about,  Well, you have a negative effect, a negative incentive effect.  Come on. In the immortal words of Joe Biden,  Malarkey!  I mean, look. The tax rate -- the marginal tax rate on top incomes -- go back before 1981 -- for at least three decades before 1981, the top marginal tax rate in this country was at least 70 percent. Under Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Republican, who nobody would have accused of being a socialist -- Bill O'Reilly would not have called him a communist -- and yet the marginal tax rate on the top incomes under Eisenhower was 91 percent. If you get rid of all the deductions and tax credits, it's still -- the effective tax rate under Eisenhower is closer to 56 percent, much higher than anybody today is talking about. We're talking -- right now, we're talking about the difference between, what, a 35 percent tax rate and maybe going back to Bill Clinton's days? I mean, this is a ridiculous debate. It should not even be debated obviously. Given where we were before and where we are now, we shouldn't even be raising this question. I mean, they will say higher taxes have a negative impact on economic growth. Well, guess what? In the three decades before 1981, when taxes were higher on the rich, the economy on average per year grew faster than it has grown since 1981. There was no negative impact on growth. I mean, George W. Bush reduces -- remember 1981 -- 2001, 2003, he reduces taxes on the wealthy, saying,  Oh, we're going to get this huge increase in growth, and we're going to get all kinds of jobs,  using and spouting supply-side -- excuse me, Art -- nonsense -- -- and what did we get? We actually had less growth. We had fewer jobs, even before the great crash. We had an economy that did not perform nearly as well as it did under the president I was very proud to have served under, that is Bill Clinton, who raised taxes. We had the largest and longest boom in modern memory, 22 million new jobs were created. That wasn't a negative growth, that was not a slowdown in growth. We raised taxes, 22 million new jobs were created. I was secretary of labor during those times. I created every single one of those jobs. -- we have to raise taxes in order to deal with the budget deficit, regardless of what your particular ideology is about a smaller or larger government. Number two, the rich have done extraordinarily well. Everybody else hasn't. In fact, median family incomes since 2000 have actually dropped 8 percent. You want to put more taxes on average working people? No. That's simply not fair. It's not going to work. Number three, the rich right now bear a lower, smaller, marginal tax burden than they have at any time in the post-war era. Of course you have to raise taxes on the rich if we're going to get on with the business of this country. So please vote against this silly proposition. Thank you. "

    "data":"If I can just start with this hotel you guys got for us today, I had the craziest thing happen. I came in a little early. And I went down to the health club. And now, I'm not an exercise freak or anything. But I was down there. And this absolutely gorgeous woman walked in. She's just beautiful. And the manager of the health club was standing right next to me, so I said,  Excuse me, by any chance do you have a machine that would attract someone like that to someone like me?  And the guy says,  Yes, I do.  And he took me over to the Citicorp ATM. And I just want to say that the rich are not the Citicorp ATM. If you look at this world, and I -- but, Robert, you're a favorite of mine, and you have been for years; and, Glenn, you did a great job on this; and Mark, I'm anticipating your comments and -- but look at it, you got -- there would be three reasons you could possibly want to raise tax rates on the rich. You're jealous of them, and Robert may be but he's one of them. And the other thing is, you're going to get more revenue. And you're going to create prosperity. Those are the other two. And I'm going to land on the last two and look at the facts if I can. I mean, in the 30 -- if you look at the growth rate there, we can go back in time, but, you know, if you look at the periods let's say from the Roaring '20s, we cut tax rates back then from 73 percent to 25 percent in the Roaring '20s. It was called the  Roaring ‘20s  for a reason. We had enormous expansion of growth, output, and employment. The top 1 percent of income earners, now, we have great data on the top 1 percent of income earners. The IRS really likes to know how much you owe them. And we have great data. The top 1 percent of income earners, their taxes as a share of GDP soared during the period of the Roaring '20s. If you look at the 1930s, we raised the highest margin -- well, we first had [unintelligible] May of 1930 we had the Smoot-Hawley Tariff. Then Hoover raised the highest tax rate on the rich from 25 percent to 63 percent. Then Roosevelt on January 1936 raised it from 63 to 79 percent and then up to 83 percent. There's a reason why it was called the Great Depression. The economy was in a shambles in large part because of the tax increases. The revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners as a share of GDP went down during this period. You look at the Kennedy period where we cut the highest tax rates from 91 percent to 70 percent. We also put in the investment tax credit, accelerated depreciation, cut the corporate rates, did tariff reform as well -- the Kennedy-run tariff negotiation, tax rate -- it was called the -- it was called the  Go-Go '60s,  if you remember, a boom in the economy, and tax revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners went up during that period as a share of GDP. We then had the four stooges, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter. Which I consider to be the largest assemblage of bipartisan ignorance probably ever put on planet Earth. If you look at that period, we had stagnation for 16 straight years. The stock market collapsed during that period. Tax revenues for the top 1 percent of income earners went down as a share of GDP. Then we had -- then we had Ronny -- oh, excuse me, the sky is opened, the sun shone forth on the planet, the grass turned green, the animals, they multiplied, the children danced in the street, but we cut the highest tax rates of everything we could find. We had Steiger-Hansen in '78, then we cut the -- I mean, under Reagan, cut it from 70 percent to 28 percent. If you look at the whole period from 1978 all the way to 2007, we cut the highest tax rate on earned income from 50 percent to 35 percent. We cut the highest tax rates on unearned income from 70 percent to 15 percent. We cut the capital gains tax rate, we cut all of these tax rates across the board. We had a boom, and it wasn't just Ronald Reagan. Robert, your president, by the way, cut the capital gains tax rate dramatically; he got rid of capital gains taxes on owner occupied homes for everyone, he also got rid of the tax on retirees working, which was the group between 65 and 72. He also put in welfare reform, he also cut gtovernment spending as a share of GDP by more than the next four best presidents combined, and he had the greatest secretary of labor of all time -- But he was a big taxer. We had huge growth during that period. If you look at what happened to the tax revenues from the top income earners -- you know, in 1980 tax revenues as share of GDP from the top 1 percent was 1.5 percent of GDP. By 2007, tax revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners was 3.2 percent of GDP, it more than doubled. Let me tell you really honestly, you're not going to get the money from these guys. You're not. They can hire lawyers, they can hire accountants, they can hire deferred income specialists, they can hire congressmen, they can hire senators -- They can hire -- when you see a group of people hanging with the president, don't for a moment think it's a group of street people trying to explain to the president what it's like being poor. They're in there for some reason and they find it. You know, what you really want to do is get a low rate, flat tax, where you have no exceptions, no exemptions, no deductions, none of that stuff. And get them out of the business of trying to finagle their tax codes, get them out of the business of trying to influence government, get them into a position where they create prosperity and economic growth. A nd that is the way you got to go. We all want increased tax rates on the rich, but we want to do it not by raising rates, which won't work, we want to do it by lowering rates and broadening the base. And if I can correct one other little mistake, Robert, just a little one. Simpson-Bowles lowers the highest tax rates on the rich, and so does Rivlin-Domenici. They lower rates, they broaden the base. In '86, we cut tax rates on the rich dramatically, from 50 percent to 28 percent. In the Senate, 97 votes for that, three against it, including Joe Biden. What was his malarkey comment? Excuse me, maybe he was looking in the mirror. But you also had Bill Bradley, you also had Howard Metzenbaum, you had all of these -- and you had Chris Dodd and you had Teddy Kennedy. Everyone knows that you don't create growth by raising tax rates on the rich. You can't love jobs and hate job creators. And you can't tax an economy into prosperity, it ain't going to happen. Thank you very much. "

    "data":"Thank you, John. Thank you. Thank you, John. Thanks, Intelligence Squared and Bob Rosenkranz for the opportunity. I did notice that on Amazon the price of my book is falling; demand, supply, you know. We need a little more demand here to help me out. Let me begin by saying that, you know, it's obvious the American economy has very serious challenges. But I would put two right at the top of the list. The first, this is in no particular order of importance, but the first is, the skewing of the distribution of income consumption and wealth, and the second is our fiscal problems. The statistics here are pretty startling. Let's begin with the income distribution, wealth distribution. If you take the top 20 percent of income earners, they take home over 50 percent of the nation's income, the top 20 percent take home 50 percent of the income. They consume 60 percent of the total pie. So, from cars to clothing and everything in between, they consume 60 percent. And they own 90 percent of the wealth. These are pretty skewed statistics. And the more startling thing is they've gotten more skewed over the past 30 years. You know, you go back to the early 1980s, late 1970s, these statistics were very different. I'll just give you one example. I mentioned that the top 20 percent accounts for 60 percent of the spending. If you go back to 1980, it was closer to 45 percent. So, it's skewed, and it's getting more skewed. Our fiscal problems are obviously very significant as well. If you go back to the year 2000 -- we'll give Bob credit for the 22 million jobs. Should we give you credit for the surplus in the year 2000, too? Okay, Bob. Let's clap for that. There was a surplus, 2000. We've been running deficits ever since. The last fiscal year just ended. We had a deficit of $1.1 trillion. You can ask,  Well, what's going on?  Lots of things. There's the wars. That's $1.2 trillion over the last 10 years. That's Afghanistan and Iraq. There's the Bush era tax cuts. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, that cost us $1.6 trillion over a 10 year period. And, of course, there was a recession, the great recession, and by my calculation, that's cost us about $1.8 trillion over the course of the last 10 years. You add it up, it's a lot of money. So, we've got some big problems, very significant issues we have to tackle. Now, the bad news is that -- it sounds pretty bad -- The bad news is that if we -- these trends will continue if policymakers don't act. If they don't act, these trends will continue, and this will harm economic growth, become very self-reinforcing in a negative way. Take the deficits. If policymakers continue on with current policy, if they don't do anything with the current tax rates, if they don't cut spending as agreed to as part of the sequestration, if they don't address the payroll tax holiday, you can go on and on and on, well, the nation's debt-to-GDP ratio is going to go from the current 70 percent -- and, by the way, it's doubled over the last 10 years from 35 to 70 percent -- it'll go over 100 percent by 2025. Now, all good research would show that we got a problem if that happens. The world's not going to work for us. At some point, investors are going to balk. Interest rates are going to rise. It's going to affect investment, productivity growth, and our living standards. That has to change. And the income and wealth distribution, the forces that are driving that aren't going to -- are firmly in place, and they're not going to change. There's many. Globalization -- a great recent piece in the New York Times, going over this, globalization, technological change -- these are all really very good things for our economy. We need to continue on with the process of globalization and certainly technological change improves all our lives, but clearly it affects the distribution of income and wealth. I'm a person with no skills and talent, I'm getting creamed by trade. I'm competing against low-wage workers in China and India. I can't compete. I'm just getting crushed. And, of course, high income households are benefitting enormously, right? I mean, Glenn, Art, Bob go off to China, they go off to India, they go off to the UK to give a speech, they get paid very well. Unfortunately, I'm not in their class, you know? I don't get paid as well. But, it's globalization that allows them to get these great returns, and their income and wealth rises. And I think the problem here is that if we don't address the skewing of the distribution and wealth, the disenfranchised are going to say,  Enough!  And they're going to stop the process of globalization, and they're going to rebel against the pace of technological change, and that's going to be to everyone's detriment, including higher income households. Now, here's the good news. We can solve this problem, and we can solve it together in a combined way. We have to think about addressing our fiscal problems through the prism of the income -- the distribution of income and wealth. So, we need to cut government spending? Absolutely. We have to do this. But, we have to do this in a way that's intelligent and m aybe means-testing for entitlement programs. You know, take -- change the entitlement programs for the wealthy into insurance policies, but that only goes so far. We don't want to go to the point where the insurance policies become a welfare program and we lose support for things like Medicare and Social Security. That'd only take us so far. So we have to address taxes. If I were king for the day, I wouldn't raise tax rates on anybody, and I don't think we need to, right? I am all for tax reform. Let's close the deductions, let's close the loopholes, let's make the tax code fairer, broaden the base, I'm all for it, but let's use the revenue to address our fiscal problems, not to cut tax rates, until we're able to do that, right? I mean, that is the best way, that is the way proposed by Simpson-Bowles, that's the way proposed by Domenici-Rivlin, and that is a bipartisan way. So this is not hard. It's -- we can do it, and that's the good news. Now, let me end this way with a personal note. I started my own company back 25 years ago with a good friend and my best friend and my brother. And I wasn't in the proverbial garage but I was pretty close. It grew into a pretty good size -- a small business. I had 100 employees when I sold it to the Moody's Corporation. And the reason I'm telling you this is because I wanted to let you know that I'm not just an egghead. You know, I look like one maybe, but I'm not. So I look at these things through the -- in terms of data, theory, and experience. And my experience says,  You need to vote against this proposition.  Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you, John. Thank you, Bloomberg. Thank you, NPR and thank you, Mr.  Rosenkranz. Look, we have a double challenge today in America. One is the need to compete in a global economy, an economy that has changed hugely even as many of us have been wrestling with it. Number two, we have the effects of the global recession: state and local budgets that are totally and completely decimated right now. And so when the investment is very, very bleak, as it is right now, and the need is very, very great, it's no wonder that people are looking to find one entity to blame. But my friends, blaming unions for school failure is like blaming the middle class for the recession. Ultimately what humans do -- what our union does proudly is have a mantra. What is good for kids and what is fair for teachers. Now, am I saying that everything we've ever done is the right thing? Absolutely not. Am I saying that we are perfect? Absolutely not. But what we are trying to do in this very, very turbulent time is search for what works. Search for what works for kids. Let me ask -- let me suggest this. If teachers unions were to be blamed for failing schools, then we would assume that schools in less unionized states would outperform schools in more densely unionized states. So you'd assume that places like Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, who have relatively few unionized teachers would do much, much better. But that's not the case. The states with the most densely unionized teachers, Massachusetts, New York, Maryland; they do the best. And the countries with the most densely unionized populations: Finland, Japan, they do the best. So what do we learn from that? What we know is that there are problems like Mr. Rosenkranz said. There are problems we have to solve. One of which is poverty. States like Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi; they have and had been plagued by tremendous poverty. We have to compete with poverty. That's what public education is and that is what the search we have for, that's what our search is, to find what works. So you felt, I hope tonight we can move from scapegoating to solutions, to problem solving. And I would argue to all of you that having a strong union, someone in an entity that will look at what it's done right and what it's done wrong, and solve things and change things, is the way to go. So what works? What can we learn from places like Maryland, Massachusetts, New York State, Finland, and Japan? This is what we can learn. This is what works. What works in places where we don't as Terry Moe will probably argue, where we don't have niche markets, where we can't marketize our schools, where we have to help all kids. So we need well-prepared and supported teachers. We need well rounded rigorous curriculum that engages kids and we can get our arms around. We need to invest in the tools and the time to differentiate instruction. We also need things like early childhood education and a focus and fixation on graduation in terms of high school. And finally, we need good services to help level the playing field for kids. Now, is this a panacea? Is this something that has never happened and it's a search for something we don't know how to find? No. We find these elements in lots of different places. And the glue that binds us together, the difference between the places that work and the places that don't are good labor management relationships. Like we see in one of my other panelists here, in the ABC school district in California which has lifted its scores, which has changed its relationships from competitive to ones that are collaborative. Does that mean as I said before that we've done everything. Of course not. Everyone has to take more responsibility in this day and age. If we're going to ensure that all kids are ready for life, for college, for career, that means that -- that means we all have to take collective responsibility. And we, at the A.F.T., attempted to do that in any number of ways: first, in pushing for common standards, including the new common core curriculum or the common core standards in pushing for better aligned assessments, in pushing for better curriculum. And in looking at ourselves and saying look, we have to have a new approach to due process. We can't have rubber rooms anymore. We can't have a choice between off with your heads and warehousing. We can't have situations where if there is incompetence in the classroom we allow that to happen. We have to have more evaluation systems that are fair, that are meaningful, that are competent, and that actually help teachers teach in a more robust way than they may be doing now. But we also have to give teachers the tools and the time and the conditions that they need to do a good job with kids. Because at the end of the day, to compete with poverty, to drift all boats, to make sure that kids get that chance to dream their dreams and to achieve it, it comes with initially that connection between teacher and kid. That connection we made every day that we teach. That connection I made with my kids at Clara Barton High School that I know Gary made when he taught. I know Kate made when she teaches. We need teachers to have the support of the people around us and the unions. The unions -- all of us. The unions will do everything in their power to help fight for the tools and the conditions that teachers need and to fight to ensure that every kid, every kid gets a well prepared and well supported teacher. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Thank you very much. It's great to be here. I want to thank Intelligence Squared for  arranging this event and for putting the spotlight on what, in my view, is the most important issue in American education today, the power of the teachers unions. I should be clear that our team is not saying that the teachers unions are responsible for every problem of the public schools. What we are saying is that the unions are and have long been major obstacles to real reform in the system. And we're hardly alone in saying this. If you read “Newsweek,” “Time Magazine,” the “Washington Post,” lots of other well respected publications, they're all saying the same thing: that the teachers unions are standing in the way of progress. So look. Let me start with an obvious example. The teachers unions have fought for all sorts of protections in labor contracts and in state laws that make it virtually impossible to get bad teachers out of the classroom. On average, it takes two years, $200,000, and 15% of the principal's total time to get one bad teacher out of the classroom. As a result, principals don't even try. They give 99% of teachers -- no joke -- satisfactory evaluations. The bad teachers just stay in the classroom. Well, if we figure that maybe 5% of the teachers, that's a conservative estimate, are bad teachers nationwide, that means that 2.5 million kids are stuck in classrooms with teachers who aren't teaching them anything. This is devastating. And the unions are largely responsible for that. They're also responsible for seniority provisions in these labor contracts that among other things often allow senior teachers to stake a claim to desirable jobs, even if they're not good teachers and even if they're a bad fit for that school. The seniority rules often require districts to lay off junior people before senior people. It's happening all around the country now. And some of these junior people are some of the best teachers in the district. And some of the senior people that are being saved are the worst. Okay. So just ask yourself, would anyone in his right mind organize schools in this way, if all they cared about was what's best for kids? And the answer is no. But this is the way our schools are actually organized. And it's due largely to the power of the unions. Now, these organizational issues are really important, but they're just part of a larger set of problems. Our nation has been trying to reform the schools since the early 1980s. And the whole time the teachers' unions have used their extraordinary power in the political process to try to block reform and make sure that real reform just never happens. Consider charter schools. There are many kids around this country who are stuck in schools that just aren't teaching them. They need new options. Well, charter schools can provide them with those options. But charter schools are a threat to teachers' unions. If you give kids choice and they can leave regular public schools, then they take money and they take jobs with them. And that's what the teachers' unions want to stop. So what they've done is they've used their power in the political process to put a ceiling on the numbers of charter schools. As a result in this country today, we have 4,600 charter schools. There are like well over 90,000 public schools. So this is a drop in the bucket. And mean time charter schools have huge waiting lists of people who are desperate to get in. In Harlem, for example, the charter schools there got 11,000 applications for 2,000 slots recently. So just to give you an idea of about how the politics of this works out, in Detroit a few years ago, a benefactor came forth and said he was willing to donate $200 million to set up additional charter schools for the kids in Detroit who obviously need it. What did the union do? The union went ballistic. They shut down the schools, went to Lansing, demonstrated in the state capitol and got the politicians to turn down the $200 million for those kids. This is good for kids? I don't think so. This is about protecting jobs. The same kind of logic applies with accountability. Accountability is just common sense. We obviously need to hold schools and teachers accountability for teaching kids what they're supposed to know. But the teachers' unions find this threatening. They say they support accountability but they don't want teachers held accountable. Any sensible effort to hold teachers accountable, they brand as scapegoating teachers. They don't even want teachers performance to be measured. Right here in New York City, Joel Klein indicated a while ago that he was going to use student test scores as one factor in evaluating teachers for tenure. What did the union do? Now, this is something that Obama supports, that Arne Duncan supports. It's unbelievable. What the union did is they went to Albany and they got their friends in the legislature to pass a law making it illegal to use student test scores in evaluating teachers for tenure anywhere in the state of New York. It's just outrageous. And makes no sense from the standpoint of what's best for kids. The “New York Times” called it absurd. This is how the unions approach accountability. Okay, well, I don't have a whole lot of time left here. So let me just quickly say our opponents are going to say tonight, and Randi has already said, there is really no conflict between standing up for the jobs of teachers and doing what's best for kids. But the thing is there is a conflict. And that's why we can't get bad teachers out of the classroom, because they protect them. That's why the schools have totally perverse organizations imposed on them, and that's why totally sensible reforms are seriously resisted in the political process. Now, what you're going to hear, I'm sure, throughout the evening is that union leaders and unions around the country, they're actually reformers too. They want to get bad teachers out of the classroom. They say they're for charter schools; they're all in favor of accountability. Well, not really. Talk is cheap. What counts is what they actually do. And what they do is to oppose reform. This is the reality. Thank you."

    "data":"Good evening, everyone. I too, would like to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation especially for having a teacher come and speak because it is a rare occasion for a teacher to actually be able to talk about education. It's usually think tanks and professors and others. So I'm really privileged to be here tonight. Thank you. The first time I heard about this, don't blame teachers' unions, I, too, thought like Randi. I'm from the common wealth of Massachusetts. Which I'm very proud to say is number one in the country. Our students perform higher than anybody else in this country academically. Yet we have the strongest collective bargaining rights in the country. So do me it just doesn't add up. And then I started thinking I'm also a doctoral student so I'm trying to learn as much as I can about research and so the next thing I did is I went straight to the literature. Even Professor Moe said publications are all saying the same thing. There is no research to support what he is saying . There is no research out there that correlates student achievement to collective bargaining rights to teach unionism, either for or against. There is no conclusive evidence so people can say what they want. And publicize. It doesn't mean that it's research-based. So with that, what do collective bargaining rates do to improve schools? And I have a lot to say. Not only am I a teacher, I'm the executive vice-president of the United Teachers of Lowell, and I deal with this firsthand as a union leader. And for me, what bargaining rights do is they provide dignity a way to provide dignity for a profession that frankly gets beat up on a lot. And the way that we can do that is we can ensure language that improves working conditions for teachers, but also for children. So one example of that, which unfortunately in my district -- my union has not been able to negotiate yet; is something like we could have language for class sizes. So early childhood children would be in smaller classes which the research shows is good for them, but that's a way we can ensure it, by having it in the teachers' contract. That's just one example. The other thing that collective bargaining rights help us with at a local level is it ensures academic freedom. What that means is there are times as a teacher that I need to advocate for the child. And that means I have to say something unpopular, something that an administrator might not appreciate me saying in front of a parent, and I need to be able to do that, to be the best teacher that I can be. And I need to be able to do that without fear. And that is why collective bargaining rights are very important when you are in a classroom, you need to be able to do what you know is best for children. And that is why it's important. Besides families, no one cares more about students and their learning, especially students living in poverty, than their teachers. And what the teachers' unions do at the local level is we serve as a conduit for the teachers. So while my opponents on the motion might say that I have my own agenda, I would argue that is absolutely not true. My agenda is the agenda of the teachers. What the teachers need. So the way that we find that out at a local level, the president of our union and the superintendent, along with other members of the executive board go to the schools and meet with the teachers and find out what they need to get their jobs done. We survey our members. And what they need in their classrooms is our agenda. So for example one thing that we've done is we've created what's been called -- the Department of Education in Massachusetts has been called the Cadillac teacher induction program. So the union and management sat down together, that's the union-initiated protocol, to make sure that every teacher in their first three years of teaching had a qualified and trained mentor. They have access to district designed graduate level courses specifically designed so that they can best meet our students in Lowell who often come with second language issues, they have full training in what they need. Also with that, the mentors are trained to talk to their mentees about whether they're in the right place or not. And to counsel them perhaps out of urban education, if that's not what's meeting their need or meeting the children's need. And also, to help them make better choices. Another thing that was union initiated that is in our contract, we call the Lowell program. It's an in-house graduate program where teachers can get their master's degree. Again, the superintendent and her colleagues have decided what the content of the course is, and we work together so that teachers are given the tools that they need. In terms of evaluations, our evaluation procedures in Lowell as negotiated are actually more stringent than what's required by state standard. So our new teachers are evaluated twice every year, whereas the state only mandates once. So in terms of unions advocating for poor evaluation measures, it's just not true. The most important thing in my opinion about what we've done -- and I can't speak to 20 years ago because unfortunately, I was only in high school, but I can speak to what's happening in schools now. And what we are doing is this labor management union. Because with all due respect, we have been -- the teachers have been told what to do. We've been given scripted curricula from under reading first grants and under these grants, and we found -- the teachers found they were not working for children. We've told what to do. Now what we need to do is have a seat at the table to be part of the decision making. And so in Lowell we have begun this journey to build collaborative structures in our district between labor and management so the people at the ground floor, the teachers, can inform the decisions that are made for children. So it is, indeed, what is best for them. Thank you."

    "data":"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm here to convince you to vote against this  proposition. All of us know that teachers are not solely to blame for our failing schools. But they bear significant responsibility and the way this is framed, the only way to express that is to vote against this proposition. Now, to understand my point of view, you have to realize how powerful these organizations are. To be blunt, teachers unions represent the most dominant political force in American education. We're not talking about little wimpy organizations. We're talking about mammoth highly financed, highly organized, highly peopled organizations. And political dominance is not something that they got unintentionally. They intended to be politically dominant. Here is a quote from Sam Lambert in 1967 about NEA. NEA would become the political -- become a political power second to no other special interest group. Listen to those words. People could argue now that they've already reached that goal. Teacher unions represent the number one political spender in the United States of America. In the state of California, the NEA spent more in the last decades than any other political spender and the second political spender spent less by a little bitter than 1/2 of what the NEA spent. These are powerful, dominant organizations. The NEA has 3.2 million members, 14,000 locals across the United States, and last year -- in 2007 they collected about $400 million from their members to supplement the other revenue streams that they had. The AFT is not a slouch either. They have 1.4 million members, 300 locals across the United States. And they're active in 43 states. NEA has state offices in every state in the United States. And that's not all. They can call on their political partners when they get in trouble. They can call on the AFL-CIO. They can call on Acorn. They can call on People for the American Way. They can call on the Center for Community Change. These are mammoth organizations and I need for you to understand that in order to understand why we take this position. Now, the American workforce, about 12% of the workforce is unionized. But in the education profession, it's 38%. Teachers' unions literally have our schools in a chokehold. This is completely dangerous. Now, power corrupts. Total power corrupts totally. You need to be clear about how they use this power. To try to convince people -- you heard a lot tonight about children and their members. Don't be fooled. Organizations have one primary interest. They may have some other interests but they have one main interest. Teachers' unions’ main interest is the welfare of their members. Another quote from NEA operative, “The main purpose of our association” -- note the word association. They don't even call themselves unions. It’s not the education of children, but rather it is all to be the extension and preservation of our members' rights. Now, that's just a statement of fact. Organizations can't serve 2 gods, little “g.” They serve one. And in the case of teachers' unions, it is the interests of their members. Now, let me tell you a live story. In 2000, a Buffalo school district had about 7,000 members and they were the most unionized public school system in the United States of America. And 7:00 a.m., on a school day, the leaders of the teachers' unions still on the Buffalo headquarters step called a strike at 7:00 a.m. on a school day. Now, many children already are on buses on the way to school. Many parents have already dropped kids off at school leaving their kids in the love care of teachers. Mistakenly. Does that sound like an organization that cares about kids? They were arguing for employee rights. Two more major points that really tick me off to some extent. Teachers unions are sitting on both sides of the negotiating table in many cases. They -- teachers unions work with school boards so that they have representatives on the school boards. When I served as superintendent of Houston, one of my nine school board employees, actually an employee of the teachers unions, fortunately for me, both were reasonable people and we got along rather well. But many school district superintendents don't have that luxury. They have school -- they have school boards that have teachers unions representatives sitting on that side of the table; the unions sitting on this side of the table. They're negotiating with themselves. They're sitting on both sides of the negotiating table. Here is the worst thing, I think, that really fires me up. Teachers unions have awesome power to cause action in schools. They have zero responsibility for their student performance. That's just not fair. That's not fair. It handicaps the principals and the superintendents who are operating with both hands tied behind their back. The teachers unions are calling the rules. They're responsible for student achievement. That's no way to run a ship. And it simply will not work that way. Now, here again, I want to be honest and I want to be fair. We can't solely blame teachers unions for these complex issues we have in our school situation but they do bear significant responsibility. And the only way you can express that is to vote against this motion to indicate that we are the nation. If we're going to really reform our schools, we're going to have to wind back from the power of teachers unions. We can still have teachers unions. We're not arguing that we shouldn't have teachers unions. Our schools are over unionized and consequently reform has run into a road block. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Both of us are here tonight. Secretary Paige, in a wonderful book he wrote with his  sister, Dr. Elaine Witty, it was entitled  The Black/White Achievement Gap: Why Closing it is the Greatest Civil Rights Issue of Our Time.  He says in the book,  Being taught to higher levels means educational support from factors outside of school. It involves the support and commitment from the entire education triage: home, school, and community.  And Secretary Paige's call to improve the effectiveness of our schools recalls an article co-written by Professor Moe entitled,  Letting Schools Work.  In that article, Professor Moe reports,  Effective schools treat teachers professionally. The teachers share in the school's goals and effective teaching in the pursuit of those goals. They participate extensively in school decisions within their classrooms. They are free to tailor their practices to the needs of their students, that effective schools are organized like teams held together by consensus, cooperation, and shared goals.  It sounds like a teacher's union to me. Thank you, Professor Moe. Now, I must clearly delineate my prejudice, my frame of reference. I am from the ABC Unified School District, southern California, about 21,000 students. We're about 89% diverse, 38 different languages spoken in my school district. We have a remarkable relationship with our affiliate, the ABC-AFT. We're affiliated with the national American Federation of Teachers, second largest teachers union in the United States. We've formed our own charter and ABC is not a charter school. We have a charter partnership agreement with the ABC/AFT where the main work of the teachers' union in my district is student achievement and the conditions that support that. Student achievement is the main work of our teachers' union. In fact, last year, Laura Rico, the president of my teachers' union had a workshop where all the union reps came in and they changed their name from union rep to learning rep. And they were told by the teachers' union president the number one job that you have in this union is student achievement. Now, that doesn't sound like a teacher's union that has anything other than their main goal, the main idea that Secretary Paige talked about -- in my district, our union, and student achievement. Here are some examples of staff development in my district that's jointly sponsored by myself and our colleagues, American Federation of Teachers. It doesn't -- what I'm going to describe to you actually comes from the national AFT, from their educational research and dissemination program. These are some of the courses that are caught by our teacher's union: instructional strategies that work; reading comprehension; school, family, and community partnerships supporting student learning, which is actually almost exactly what Secretary Paige points out in his book that we need to improve schools. We spend -- actually my teacher's union spends 10s of thousands of dollars in direct staff development with our community and our teachers to improve learning. Now, don't blame my district's union for failing schools. They're one of the reasons my district is successful. Now, we have our challenges. We're a program improvement district. Last year, despite $34 million in budget cuts, we doubled the greatest gains in the history of the district. We passed the magic benchmark of 814 -- 800, actually in California, went to 814. We didn't do that despite the teacher's union. We did that because of the teacher's union. Let me give you an example. In my district, 10 of my schools -- these are struggling schools that have just received an innovation grant where each of these schools has a separate program to innovate and improve that school specifically tailored to the needs of that individual school. That innovation grant came from the American Federation of Teachers National Organization. $3.3 million in innovation grants funded the ABC Unified School district, 10 of our 30 schools. That's not just in California or ABC. Actually, the grant funded programs and districts in 8 different states. The American Federation of Teachers National Organization is one of the most innovative programs in the United States. Now, some of the things that those innovation grants are funding in my district, I said partnership efforts in 10 schools. In other districts throughout the United States, they're working on community partnerships, working on using student assessment data to evaluate teachers. They're also working on creating charter schools. So if you're for charters, if you're for holding teachers accountable, using student assessment data, listen to the American Federation of Teachers. Now, Secretary Paige, Randi Weingarten agrees with you. That great teachers make the real difference in closing the achievement gap. In fact, the “Washington Post” reported in January that Randi said,  Fair, transparent, and expedient processes to identify and deal with ineffective teachers need to be developed.  And she specifically pointed to student assessment data. Now, her direction was put in action most recently in the New Haven Federation of Teachers district by a vote of 842 to 39. That district agreed to use student assessment data to evaluate teachers. In addition, they agreed that the city could close schools if they didn't work and change the employees. Now, twice each year American Federation of Teachers hosts the Shanker Institute. I have been proud to be part of that since 2005. Let me tell you what we learned at the Shanker Institute. These are different workshops: state standards curriculum bridging the gap, partnering for a reform in troubled times, improving the quality and the use of student assessment data. The unions’ role in assuring that teacher quality matters -- teacher quality meets student needs. In every seminar I have been to, there has never been a session on how to keep crummy teachers. They don't do that. And in fact, in most cases, the superintendents I know that work closely with teachers unions find that we release more teachers to other industries than we do keeping them. In fact, in nearby Brooklyn, there is the United Federation of Teacher Institute. They do much the same thing. They use data, talk about communication, team building, professional development and action plans. States with teachers unions set the highest standards, according to “Education Week.” “U.S. News and World Report” reported on the most -- 25 most successful schools. Six out of 10 of those schools come from states with strong teacher's unions. Success, high standards, accountability. If you want that, support teacher's unions in schools where that works."

    "data":"I'm glad Gary brought up Mr. Shanker, because he is alleged to have said when school  children start paying dues, that's when I'll start representing them. Now, I don't know if he did say that. Some people think he did, some say no. But that has been the teacher's union attitude ever since I began my teaching career here in New York City in 1971. In educating children, there is nothing more valuable than a dedicated and gifted teacher and nothing more harmful and destructive than a bad one. And it's those teachers, the mediocre and the incompetent ones that the unions typically represent. In fact, they punish good teachers in numerous ways. Unions insist that school districts not pay good teachers what they're worth. They insist on an archaic factory model of payment whereby teachers make more money by years on the job -- not productive years, just by calendar progression. Consider the greatest teacher of our time, Jaime Escalante, subject of the film “Stand and Deliver,” now unfortunately near death in his native Bolivia; attracted national attention at Garfield high school in Los Angeles with his spectacular success teaching college level calculus to gang members and other unteachables. Talk about poor students. What was the problem? Because he was willing to have more students in his class than the United Teachers of Los Angeles contract allowed for, he was basically run out of town by that union. When there are layoffs due to budget cuts, do the worst teachers get laid off? No. Do the permanents or tenure, a union must in every contract, the newest hires are let go. You're a teacher of the year? Too bad. You're double test scores? Too bad. But the unions will go to any length, any length to save the job of a bad tenured teacher. If you think I'm exaggerating, here is a quote from an LA union rep. If I'm representing them it's impossible to get them out. It's impossible unless they commit a lewd act. End quote. And maybe not even then. You're laughing. This is a true story and this didn't happen very long ago. Was a former colleague, he's alleged to have touched a female student inappropriately. There are witnesses. The female student would not press charges. So they put X into the district office for a while, the so-called rubber room, which probably most of you know of. They decided to put him, by the union lore, they put him in another school. He apparently did the same thing. Back to the rubber room: sitting, sitting. Finally, one day, I guess he got bored. He decided to bring porn to the district office, the rubber room. He got caught. With the union lawyers’ help, he got put back into a school, another school, the third school now. And in short order, he got caught showing his female students some of his pornography collection. The last I heard he's back in a district office waiting for his union lawyer to make the next move. This is the kind of guy that really needs the union. Not a dedicated teacher. Not an honest teacher here. This is the kind of guy who really needs the union. By the way, the guy I'm talking about, Mr. X. is really a pussy cat compared to some of the teachers you have in New York. Just reading some things about a -- I'm only saying his name because it's in the newspapers, Francisco Olivares, who impregnated one of his students and his still on the payroll. Another instance of my middle school involved a teacher who decided to sunbathe topless on the athletic field at lunch. It was a nice spring day. What happened? With the union's help, she was put back into school in an elementary school this time. Once again, a union rep in his own words, “I've gone in and defended teachers who shouldn't even be pumping gas.” Not my quote. This is a union rep. That's the mentality. Unions today function more like criminal lawyers than partners in education reform. Very importantly, too, the unions love the status quo and will fight to keep it. In California recently, education reformer, Bill Evers was attacked by a local union for trying to get Singapore math a new and innovative way of teaching a subject, but because learning all the different things you had to do to teach this was a little bit too much for some of the teachers, the unions decide to kill it. Very importantly, the unions are constantly trying to limit the number of charter schools. “The Cartel,” an excellent film by Bob Bowden, about public education has one of the most affecting scenes I've ever seen on film. It shows parents and children waiting to see if they won the lottery. That is if they got into the charter school. If charter schools have more children than seats available, very simply they'll hold a lottery. And in this scene the camera goes into -- close on the faces of the children and the parents who are winning the lottery and getting to the charter school and they're thrilled and you feel happy for them. And then they go into the people who didn't win, and these people are crying and sad and you feel horrible for them: very affecting scene. But these tears of joy and anger -- tears of joy and sadness turn to anger because you realize the unions are constantly fighting the establishment of charter schools as the UTLA did just about two weeks ago in Los Angeles. They were very successful at killing charter schools. Another abominable example, I'm going to speak a little quickly because I'm running out of time. The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, it was created to rescue at least some children from the horrible school district, Washington D.C. We spent $27,000 per student. Probably the worst school system in the country. 1,700 kids, mostly poor, mostly black, won the lottery which gave them a $7,500 scholarship to get into the best schools they could, private or parochial. The program was a great success. The kids looked forward to going to school for the first time. They thrived. The parents were happy. The taxpayers saved money. The only ones not happy were the unions who cannot abide any competition for the government run monopolies, even though it has been shown that when school choice exists, public schools improve. I will close with a quote from Ron Williams who said about this situation, “The NEA seems far more devoted to its members than they are of the children they teach. It doesn't seem to bother them that they continue to fail the nation's most vulnerable children.” Amen to that, Mr. Williams. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you. Let me actually just start with that question. You know, I went to Stanford undergrad, Stanford law school. Throughout the '90s, I had a belief that education was absolutely paramount. We should only hire people that went to the best schools. And -- and we discriminated on this basis very aggressively in hiring at PayPal. And I use this -- and I used to -- I thought this was the most important thing in our society. And over the last four or five years, I've gradually come to shift my views on it for a number of different reasons. The narrow technology context in Silicon Valley, that I saw so many very talented people who had not gone through college tracks and who had still done extraordinary well. In some ways, they were also more creative. They were not laden down with enormous college debt that was somehow forcing people to take better paying jobs that were more munitive [spelled phonetically] but more boring, and track them into things that were not as interesting or important, that were discouraging people from doing things in nonprofit work or on the more entrepreneurial side. And this has become a more and more acute issue over the years because unlike the time when I went to college, the cost has gone up tremendously. The amount of debt that people leave college with have gone up tremendously. And so the choices are very different from the ones people had 25 years ago. College costs in nominal dollars have gone up by more than a factor of 10 since 1980. Even after inflation, it's gone up by 300 percent. Costs about four times as much. Inflation adjusted to go to college now as it did 30 years ago, it's gone up more than anything else in our society, more than health care, more than housing, more than any of a number of other things we think of as having been subject to runaway cost inflation and escalation. And as I looked outside of just the narrow Silicon Valley entrepreneurial context I've come to believe that the problem is much broader, it's not just the most talented people who are perhaps being misdirected and encouraged to go on a very narrow tracked career, but that this is a broader problem and that we are in fact experiencing something of a bubble in education, a bubble that is as pernicious as the bubbles we had in technology in the '90s and housing in the 2000s, and like those two other bubbles is characterized by two things, number one, runaway costs where people are paying more and more for something where the quality hasn't gone up -- in the '90s it was tech stocks, in the 2000s it was housing -- education, I'm not saying it's worse than it was 30 years ago but I don't think it's gotten much better, and secondly by an incredible psychosocial dynamic where you cannot question it. And in '99 in Silicon Valley you couldn't question the NASDAQ valuations, and in 2005 you could not question people buying houses, it was strictly taboo and forbidden, and in the same way this is the one thing people still really believe in our society. And to question the value of education is like questioning existence of Santa Claus with three-year-old kids or something like that. And while we're not trying to scare the children here or anything like that, we do think that we cannot afford to have a third bubble in this country. We had two already. They were catastrophically bad. They led to enormous misallocation of resources. And when we look at education more carefully there are a lot of worrisome signs. Student debts at this point total over a trillion dollars, and when you look at how well people are doing who come out of college, they are still doing pretty well, they're still doing better than they used to, but the outperformance has been going down, and going down since about 2000. And, you know, the law school context I'm quite familiar with, there are about 50,000 people a year who graduate from law school in the U.S., there only are 30,000 legal jobs available in the U.S. and I would argue we have maybe too many lawyers as is, but we're producing way more for a society that probably already has too many. The median wage for lawyers is 62,000 which isn't that great considering that you've taken on another quarter million in law school debt typically. Pre-med, only about nine percent of the people who study pre-med have slots available to them in medical school. The other 91 percent are wasting their time, and somebody should have told them that their freshman or sophomore year and not waited till their senior year or several years of post college to figure that sort of stuff out. If you broaden the ambit more generally, there's something like 17 million people in the labor force who have college degrees and are basically doing unskilled work or find the narrow and extreme statistics, there's something like 6,100 people in the U.S. who have Ph.D.s and are doing janitorial work. And so when we say that education is important and paramount, that is true but it can also be a distortion and it can be a distraction from some of the very real problems we have as a society. We need to figure out how do we create more jobs, how do we create more good paying jobs. We don't have enough of either in our society. And while education is linked to them, it's not this absolute thing. And we want to question this notion that education is an absolute good or an absolute necessity. And in fact when people say as our opponents do that it is an absolute good or an absolute necessity, you start ignoring all these problematic facts, you start making a lot of catastrophic approximations that abound. And that's what we want to sort of push back a little bit. Let me say one thing that we're not arguing for. We're not saying that nobody should go to college. We're not saying that college is categorically a bad thing. We're not saying everybody should drop out. We're simply saying that too many people are going to college, just like too many people are buying houses and too many tech companies were going public in the late '90s, doesn't mean there should be no tech companies or no houses, it doesn't mean we should shut down all the colleges, but we shouldn't -- we need to make this a much more careful deliberate choice. And what we are hoping to start with this discussion and debate today is a discussion that would encourage all of you to think more about your future. Do not think of education as something that's an automatic ticket to the future, you need to think about it yourself. If I had to do something over again, having gone to Stanford, I probably would still go to college even with the higher costs, if I didn't have any great ideas of what to do instead I'd probably still do the exact same thing as I did in the late '80s even with all the problems. But one thing I would try to do very differently is not accept the answer that this was the automatic thing, that this was the thing you should do without thinking, I would have tried to think about what I want to do with my life as a senior in high school and a senior in college and not simply have more education be the automatic default answer for everything. The question we want to push the other side back on a little bit is if education is an absolute good or absolute necessity, who is accountable if it is a mistake? And if these people are taking on these enormous debts are getting it wrong, where can they go to get a refund?  "

    "data":"Well, thank you all for being here, especially Mayor Emanuel. Thank you for coming. You gave a great speech this morning on the budget. This is an important debate. It’s about the American dream. It’s about social mobility and American democracy. Because the answer to the question as to whether too many kids go to college is fundamentally about what kind of a society we hope to create. I care deeply about this issue. I’m an educator, 28 years at Princeton, 14.5 years as Northwestern’s president, now chair of a proprietary for-profit college, Rasmussen College, and a member of the Board of Education, appointed by the mayor for the Chicago Public School System. Sure, some dropouts make it big. But social and economic policy should be informed by data and analysis, not anecdotal individual life histories, no matter how compelling. Most people are not Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. We should not misread particular circumstances at particular moments in time as an indication of likely long outcomes. As Damon Runyon once said, “The race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong, but that’s how the smart money bets.” The argument that too many people are going to college is not new. In his youth, Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, argued this in “The Overeducated American” in 1976. He was wrong then, and our opponents are wrong now. And by the way, he’s changed his mind. We now have studies and lots of information. Mr. Rosenkranz alluded to some of them, which should persuade anyone with an open mind that more years of school, post-secondary, are positively correlated with earning over one’s lifetime, and also correlated with lower rates of unemployment and shorter duration being unemployed when a higher degree is not obtained. 4.3 percent of college graduates are unemployed. More than triple that number of high school students or high school dropouts are unemployed. This is very compelling. There’s a clear wage premium to education. There’s also a social premium to society, not just individual. Society benefits through greater productivity, lower crime, better health, better citizenship for more educated people. And the wage premium to education has been growing since the 1980s, not shrinking. The question to be decided is whether it’s true that too many kids go to college. Fact: In 2010, about 66 percent of the United States population between 25 and 30 had some college experience. The rest were high school grads or high school dropouts. It’s hardly the case that everyone or too many are pouring into college. We need more, not fewer, college graduates. Going to college in the United States, by the way, means very different things. From two-year community colleges, flagship public research universities, small denominational colleges, elite privates, and for-profits. By the way, at the for-profits, the average age of the students is 28, and these are not kids. Many of them are single mothers. Many are minorities. They don’t choose to attend such a place for a liberal arts education or because we have great athletic teams or a climbing wall. They come to improve their careers, their income, their life chances, and they do. In his articles, Mr. Murray argues that too many people are going to college, and I feel he believes in innate qualities. He uses a language like, “He does not have it in him.” But how does he know this? What measures does he have for a great understanding of cognitive abilities or their impact? He believes, I think, that abilities are fixed. It’s a highly stratified view of the world and people’s places in it, and I don’t share it. True, plenty of people who graduate high school are not college ready. We know this in Chicago. But low college graduation rates and dropout cannot be attributed everywhere and completely to individual's intelligence or competence. Even some qualified students in high school may not attain to a four-year degree within six to eight years because of their lack of resources which compels them to leave and drop out. No doubt, some people don't have the smarts or the personality skills to succeed. But for many, their environment at pre-college school systems have played a big role in not preparing them. We should not be so ready to consign them to what Mr. Murray may feel is their fate. Neither they nor our society will benefit from pushing them into what, for many will be low-level jobs. Because for every college degree holder who is a janitor or a waitress, there are thousands of times janitors and waitresses who are high school dropouts. Mr. Thiel has acknowledged a correlation in his own writings between college attendance and higher income. But he doubts the direction of causation. That is, college may pay off for some people because smarter people go to it. In my view, whatever the direction of causation, you can learn skills at college and improve your life chances. And by the way, we have lots of studies, including studies of twins that Allen Kruger and others have done which shows you can isolate the college experience itself among all the other variables which count. And college does make a difference. Now, high school vocational alternatives are there, but they're not widely regarded as -- they're widely regarded as second best by the general public. Polls show that most Americans agree that everyone does not need to go to college. They support alternatives for other people's children. I wonder if those in favor of the proposition want their own children or relatives to not go to college. Mr. Thiel, Mr. Murray, I know Mr. Thiel has started this fund, and I applaud his generosity. It is very generous. Will he fund tens of thousands, millions? All the trend lines show a shift in the U.S. economy and its labor force towards more people requiring post secondary education because growth industries require post secondary education. We've hollowed out industrial jobs. The clear way to premium for college graduates is growing. It skyrocketed in the 1980s and 1990s. Advanced degree holders did vastly better, and their advantage continues to hold up. And by the way, for women, that wage premium is even higher than for men. I need to conclude, but I want to conclude by saying there are not many alternatives in the U.S. We don't have a vocational system like Switzerland or Germany. I'm not against building such a vocational system. I'd like to see more tracks that people can go to. But what we really need to do is do better in pre-K through 12. We cannot accept that too many kids go to college. In summary, those who go beyond secondary school are -- not all kids. There are not too many of them. I'm not willing to consign them to low-level jobs. We need to do better, and we can't give up on the American dream. Thank you.  "

    "data":"I think we better get the topic straight. When I agreed to debate on too many kids are going to college, I thought of college as being four-year colleges leading to the BA. I didn't think of it as a whole range of community colleges and the rest. Anyway, that's the way I'm going to argue tonight because if the proposition were that too many kids are trying to get more education and training after high school, I wouldn't have accepted the position on the affirmative. Almost everybody needs more education after high school. What they don't need is to chase after this fraudulent, destructive, antediluvian thing called a BA. The thesis of my argument really is that the BA is the work of the devil. Let's go through each of those accusations. First, fraudulent. The BA is supposed to signify, in a very old-fashioned term, that you are an educated man, now -- an educated person. You know and I know that it doesn't represent that any more. The number of colleges that require the core courses that's go into a liberal education is virtually not -- don't exist. But it's much worse than that. If the only thing you know about a person is that that person has a BA, you don't know anything. If that seems too extreme, I can document all kinds of stories about courses in introductory economics which use magazine articles as the text about students who get a BA after four years without having to write a single solitary term paper, about exam scores which, by any traditional grading system means a D or an F. But guess what? They're transmuted into Bs. And why are they transmuted into Bs? Because the story they want -- have now is retention, whereby the point of a college is to bring in as much tuition money as you can. And you've got to retain kids. And in fact, if they want to drop out of courses and stay for five or six years instead of four, that's just fine with the college. You can talk to employers all over the country who will tell you about applicants who have BAs, who can't write grammatical sentences in their applications and sometimes can't read very well. All of these things do not refer to the products of a few diploma mills. I am talking about large chunks of the second tier and third tier state college and university systems. And I'm also talking about large numbers of courses and students in the first tier system and a whole lot of very expensive elite colleges. Knowing what major a person had doesn't tell you very much. Yeah, if it's math, if it's hard sciences, if it's engineering, okay. But what does it mean if you have a political science degree, spoken by a person who has a political science degree, if you're going to an employer and saying you ought to hire me. It doesn't really mean anything. Now, here is what you do know about a person with a BA if you know what school they came from. So if the applicant came from Harvard, you know a whole lot about what person was like at age 18 before he went to college. You know he had terrific SAT scores, and you know he had a terrific high school record or he wouldn't have gotten in. You don't know anything about what Harvard has added. And as a graduate of that institution, trust me, I am living proof of that statement in a whole bunch of ways. None of this should be news to any of you. The retreat of the academy from rigorous education is known to everybody who's in higher education. Except for majors in engineering and math and the hard sciences which account for just 12 percent of undergraduates, the bachelor's degree, all by itself, is meaningless. Okay, destructive. Even though we know that the BA is substantively meaningless, it remains true that for millions of jobs you can't get a job interview unless you have one. And the problem is that employers are behaving rationally when they do that because you've got about 32 percent of adults that have a BA. The employers know how clueless many of them are. Why should they go outside that pool and take even lower levels of population in terms of their ability. So they're being rational. But the problem is this: We have created a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. We have created a culture in which not having a BA labels you, in the minds of way too many people, as being either dumb or lazy. And so a lot of ambitious kids who have no interest in sitting in classrooms for four years and accumulating these large student loan debts, nonetheless want the piece of paper. It is not surprising that we have all the horror stories which are documented in journal articles and large surveys, not anecdotally, of kids who take the easiest possible classes and don't study. They aren't there to get an education. They're there to get a piece of paper. It is hugely destructive to have created this kind of false credential. It is destructive to the majority of young people who don't try to go to college because they know college is not for them. It is destructive for about 40 percent of those who start college who never finish. But most of all it is destructive to America's civic culture. We have always prided ourselves upon the idea that everybody is equal in all the ways that count with regard to human dignity. We have given a meaningless educational credential a role in our culture that says otherwise. Antediluvian. I have time just to state the proposition and hope to have a chance to elaborate later, the four-year brick and mortar college is obsolete. Four years is almost always too long. There's hardly any profession that requires four years of class work. A lot of them require an apprenticeship much longer than that. The rationale for a big physical plant at a residential college is just vanishing. What's the rationale for having a library these days? It used to be central. Why should it be that the brilliant professor giving a lecture where he doesn't take any individual relationships with students but just giving a superb lecture, why is he giving that lecture to 150 kids who happen to be sitting in the hall, why isn't it being given to millions? Distance education has all sorts of possibilities it didn't have before. The information revolution is giving us a cornucopia of new ways to help kids get an education. Well, that just begins to say what I want to say but what I'm really coming down to is nobody should go to college as the system is now defined. What we need is a transformation that gives young people a chance to tell employers or for that matter to tell graduate admissions officers what they know and what they can do, not where they learned it and how long it took them. Thank you.  "

    "data":"it must be because I'm an immigrant, I'm a tech entrepreneur, I'm a foreign [unintelligible], that I have a totally different perspective on this whole debate. In fact, when I first stepped into it, it was ripping Peter Thiel's head off in an article I wrote for telling kids to drop out of college because it didn't make sense to me. You know, as an academic for the last six or seven years I've been researching what's happening globally. I've been researching the impact of globalization on U.S. competitiveness. I've been researching American schools versus other schools, and so on, and what makes America what it is, you know our competitiveness, immigration, and so on, those topics I've been researching. And when I step back from that, my conclusion is that these people in America are totally completely out of touch. If you read my writings, you'll see that I've been writing very controversial articles, each of them rip into a different aspect of American competitiveness because we don't get it. We're sitting here in our own little bubble disconnected from the rest of the world. Now, let -- I'm going to give you three perspectives on this. First of all, about U.S. education itself, believe it or not, U.S. education is by far the best in the world. Everyone is trying to be like us. This is -- you know, I mean, people from abroad stake their life savings, you know, all the money they can possibly raise and invest it in sending their kids to America because we've got the best schools. What do gain [spelled phonetically] from our schools? It's not the courses. It's really the knowledge. It's how to learn. You gain social skills. You learn how to interact with other people. You learn how to deal with failure, make compromises. You learn how to solve problems. These are sort of things you learn because our schools have a way of making you socialize, making you think, making you compete, and American kids come out the best and the brightest in the world. This is why America is what it is. Now, another argument we're discussing is well, some kids shouldn't go to college. You know, Charles has written a lot about IQ, IQ tests being determinants of who will and won't succeed in life. To me that's complete baloney. I mean, my whole life I've faced stereotypes because I happen to be like a -- you know, one -- a race that may not be very smart. In my youth it just be that my people were beggars and snake charmers, then we became low level engineers, now we're hotshot CEOs.  In my lifetime I've seen the transformation of how people perceive me. So if I was going by these classifications of who should be and who shouldn't be educated, my people shouldn't get education because we don't really deserve it, we're not going to be successful, therefore, leave us out. You'll find the same thing with many other minorities in America. We don't know. I tell you if -- I know from my own children that they've gone through gyrations, so trying to decide what they want to be when they grow up. When they were young, they had some ideas. They don’t -- other ideas. Now, if I had to decide when my sons were 16 years old, whether they would go to school or not based on their aptitude, it would be the worst decision I could possibly ever make because I’d be wrong. Both of them decided to do completely different things than what they were talking about when they were young. Children don’t know. So who are we? Who are parents to try to figure out whether they should get education or not? America is what it is because of our education system. America started educating the masses, and its productivity rose. We became the most fiercely competitive land in the world because we educated everyone. Now there are a lot of people left out as Henry talked about, but the solution to fixing America’s competitiveness is to bring everyone up to educate everyone. Now we can debate what a college is. To me, a community college is a college.  A college -- you know, Peter Thiel basically has lived in this bubble called Silicon Valley where everyone thinks -- when they think college, they think Stanford. They think Berkeley maybe, so, you know, one level below Stanford, but that’s it. And when he talks and when he gives all these great talks about education, he talks about $200,000 of debt, $250,000 of debt. I know some great people who have gone to community colleges who have almost no debt, who worked part time, been able to pay their fees off. Our community colleges in this country are also colleges, and they too are better than the best -- they too are better than the best institutions in most other countries of the world. I don’t know why we keep forgetting that. Now, I also taught, you know, I teach at several universities. I was at [unintelligible] University, and my students brought up Peter Thiel. He’s quite a legend worldwide now. They were talking -- they said, “Professor, is there really an American investor who’s paying children to drop out of college?” I mean, they were so, so confused. At the end of it, we talked about it, and they said, “You know, this is great because we’re going to eat their lunch.”  This is what they were thinking. They didn’t say it. But this is what’s happening in the world right now. Just as we had these stupid debates about educating our children, the rest of the world has learned our trick. India and China are now graduating 1.5 million engineers a year. They’re educating all their people because they know that it’s going to make them like America, and they’re going to eat our lunch. So if we keep having these silly debates about four-year degrees and this and that, we’re going  to lose out. You talk about entrepreneurship, again -- again, I have a lot of respect for Peter Thiel while chatting with him, but, you know, he talks about entrepreneurs who can be pulled out of school and do very successful. Fine. They’re 25, maybe 200, 2,000 people in America who don’t need to go to college. I have researched this systematically. What we found was that the difference between entrepreneurs in the tech industry, in the same world that Peter comes from, the difference between entrepreneurs who have a Bachelor’s degree and who have a high school degree is huge, almost two-to-one in terms of revenue and number of employees. In terms of success, that’s how much difference education makes. Now, the interesting thing is what we also learned was that it doesn’t matter what school you graduate from. The tech founders in America, the most successful people in America graduated from a wide assortment of universities. There are almost as many universities as there were entrepreneurs in the research we did. It didn’t matter whether you graduated from a community college or whether you graduated from Harvard. You could still make it big as an entrepreneur. Why? Because school gave you that basic foundation to be able to learn. Now, moving forward, the Indian and Chinese are going to be eating our children’s lunch, guaranteed. I mean, I’ve researched it enough to know that we have a lot to worry about. If we disarm [spelled phonetically] right now and stop teaching them, we’re going to become like they used to be. They are absolutely going to demolish this country. And what’s going to happen is that globalization is going to wreck havoc on industries. Already we’re talking about manufacturing. We’re talking about several industries now going offshore. It’s going to happen more and more. We’re going to have to keep constantly reeducating our workforce.  Ten years from now, we’re going to have to have massive retraining programs for our workforce. If you don’t even have a Bachelor’s degree, if you don’t even have basic education, you’re beyond hope. These people may be end up, you know, waiting tables at restaurants, but we’re going to have too many of those. We need to provide our workforce with a basic education. I say we’d have to have every American getting at least a Bachelor’s degree and encouraging them to do Master’s and Ph.D.s. "

    "data":"The motion before us tonight is No Fracking Way: The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good. Yes, the gas boom is doing more harm than good, but why? What is going on? Simply, the gas companies are rushing forward in the face of too many unknowns and too little control. In essence, these companies are engaged in an uncontrolled experiment, which is resulting in extreme and, in some cases, permanent harm to people, communities, and the environment that cannot be compensated for by any possible benefits. What my partner, Deborah Goldberg, and I will be talking with you about tonight is what those harms are that are being faced across the country because of the natural gas boom: the health risks for individuals, the impacts to the environment, and the costs for local communities. And why, in the face of the unknown, in the face of the harms, gas companies are so intent on rushing forward hoping to figure it out along the way.   Well, what exactly is fracking? Deborah and I use the term fracking to refer to the entire cradle-to-grave process of natural gas extraction, from site preparation through transmission to end uses. The process begins with cutting access roads through the existing landscape and stripping a site about the size of five football fields to serve as a multi-well pad. Then the drilling rig will arrive, along with thousands of truckloads of equipment, water, sand, and chemicals that will be used to drill thousands of feet into the ground and miles horizontally. This is followed by the actual fracturing of the well which involves repeatedly, for a month or more, forcing two to eight million gallons of water and hundreds of undisclosed chemicals underground, under pressure, to fracture the rock, allowing the gas to escape. Then something must be done with the large quantity of contaminated wastewater, up to several million gallons per well, that will come back up along with the methane now released from the shale. If not properly handled, the methane may find its way into nearby drinking water wells. It may also be released into the air either intentionally or as a result of leaks. The methane gas that is captured is then processed and forced through gathering lines and into high pressure pipelines that will need to be constructed from numerous wellheads for hundreds and thousands of miles to the place where the gas will be burned, permanently carving up the landscape and communities that lie in between. To give you a clearer idea of how this fracking process is impacting people and communities, imagine that you'd go home tonight and find out that your next-door neighbor has signed a lease with a gas drilling company without asking you. What can you expect from this industrial activity going on next door? Even though you didn't choose to lease, you will be exposed to the same risks of contamination to the water you drink and the air you breathe as your neighbor. You will be subject to the same threat of leaks and spills of the fracking wastewater, which contain known carcinogens and radioactive material. Fracking-related spills occur on average once every three days in Colorado. Moreover, the industry has no safe disposal plans for this waste. Much of it is currently injected into underground wells, but this practice has been linked to earthquakes, and there's growing evidence that these wells are leaking. The gas well itself, and associated processing compression in storage tanks, will leak toxic and smog-forming air pollutants. The once pristine air in fracked parts of Wyoming is now worse than the air in Los Angeles because of this. The few studies we do have show increased risks of cancer and respiratory diseases in gas land communities linked to these releases.  Like your leasing neighbor, you will be unable to escape noise that can sound -- the constant day and night truck traffic, estimated by New York State at 4,000 truck trips per well. There will be 24/7 noise that can sound like a jet engine, and glaring lights all night long during the drilling and fracturing of the well over the next month or more. You will also potentially have gas pipelines cross your property whether you agree to it or not, and you will be subject to the same increase in your taxes as your drilling neighbor when your town has to repair the road damage caused by the heavy truck traffic that comes with fracking that will tear apart your rural and suburban streets, and when your town has to meet the increased demands for community services from transient drill crews. Proponents argue that the economic benefits outweigh these risks so far. But what are the supposed benefits of this industrial activity almost literally in your backyard, or down the street from your children's pool? The economic benefits for you will be limited. There will be access to cheap natural gas at least for a little while, but it won't last for very long because the amount that can be forced out of the earth is limited and will run out. But even more important, it will not remain cheap, because the industry will be doing everything it can to increase the price of gas, including exporting America's gas to other countries where they can triple -- yes, triple the price -- on the U.S. market today. The drilling will bring jobs, at least while the drill rigs are in town, but not very many and not for long, and these gas industry jobs are some of the most life-threatening in the country. Oil and gas workers are seven times more likely to die on the job than the national average. And fracking can destroy businesses that could sustain local economies into the future after the fracking boom is over, like agriculture, recreation, and tourism.  What is clear is that gas companies are not willing to wait. The natural gas boom is moving forward as a large uncontrolled experiment with every individual, family, and community who has not signed a lease being forced to participate without their consent. Whatever transitory benefits fracking may provide is outweighed by all of the harms that it currently brings. But even more important, there are some harms that simply cannot be compensated for. If you can no longer live in your home or continue to work your family farm, if you lose your health, the health of your child, if you lose your life as hundreds of oil and gas workers have.  If you lose access to drinkable water or breathable air as individuals in communities across the fracking states have, there is no good that can outweigh such harm. Until we have a much better understanding of the processes and the true risks, until there are mandatory rules in place to control these risks and eliminate the extreme harm, and until the industry actually follows those rules, the only defensible course of action is a cautious one. The only reasonable and fair answer is,  No, no fracking way.  "

    "data":"Thank you. In Kate's opening statement, there's one word that she didn't use, and that word is  coal.  We're going to use that word a lot on our side of the ledger tonight, because part of the case for natural gas is it's the best single way to diminish our use of coal. And coal is without question the most environmentally hazardous fuel that we have in America. You know, Fred Krupp from the Environmental Defense Fund was in Aspen not very long ago, and he did a panel on fracking, and he said, you know,  I'm a realist. I'm also an environmentalist. Fracking is here, and we have to regulate it.” It's not that impossible. We regulate banks. We regulate children's toys. We regulate automobiles. We do regulate banks, actually. But when it comes to gas, we are in the golden age of gas, that's what we're in. It's not like we have a little bit of gas that we're busy trying to extract here and there, and it's going to run out tomorrow.  We have something on the order of 2,000 trillion cubic feet of gas. We use about 24 trillion cubic feet a year. So, we have about an 80 to 100-year supply right now. That means, among other things, that gas is incredibly cheap. Right now it's in the two-dollar range. It probably -- yes, it probably will go up to the four or five-dollar range, which still makes it much cheaper than most other fuels and makes it very competitive with coal. Gas has -- cheap energy is an enormous boon for the country, just cheap energy across the board. It increases our GDP. It has enormous ramifications well beyond jobs. Natural gas also has the ability to be a transformative fuel and a bridge fuel as we think about moving to renewal. Excuse me, one second. So the economic benefit is one kind of benefit.  A second kind of benefit obviously is the energy security benefit. I'm going to read something from the Wall Street Journal that ran just a few days ago.  America will halve its reliance on Middle East oil by the end of this decade and could be completely rid of it by 2035 due to the declining demand and the rapid growth of new petroleum sources in the western hemisphere. Shale rock is one of those sources.  Now, who made this projection? It was OPEC itself.  Think about a world where you don't have to worry about cartels, you don't have to worry about being dependent on our enemies for oil, a world where foreign policy is not dictated by our need for oil. The ability of the United States to have its own resource once again in a way that we never thought we were going to is a tremendous gift that's been handed to us, and fracking is the way that we're taking advantage of it.  Now, the third aspect that I want to talk about is the environmental benefits, which is real and which is happening now. As recently as 2009, 45 percent of the power generation in the country was coal, 23 percent was natural gas. Today, it's about evenly split. There is a rush to natural gas and away from coal. This is a great thing for the country. Natural gas has half the CO2 emissions than coal, 90 -- coal has 90 times more sulfur dioxide, five times more nitrogen oxide. Coal is the dirtiest fuel we have. And so, if facilities could switch to natural gas, it has the potential to transform the country. You know, in Europe, where they like to think of themselves as extremely environmentally sensitive, their emissions are actually going up because they're building more coal fire power plants. In America, our emissions are flat and going slightly down, according to studies. And a large part of the reason is because we're having this rush to natural gas. The same is also true of China, of Mexico, of Russia, and of a handful of other countries that are relying on other sources than gas. We have -- what we actually have is a minute and 31 seconds. "

    "data":"To start, I'd like to bring the focus back to the motion that we've been asked to debate. We aren't here tonight to decide whether or not fracking is a gift or if it's a Trojan Horse. We are here to decide whether or not the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. So, what characterizes a boom? It's big. It's sudden. And it blows a lot of smoke. And the natural gas boom is doing all of that to an extreme. It's too much. It's too fast. And the hype is just over the top. So, why do I say that it's too much? The most serious health and environmental impacts of fracking are largely due to very intensive gas development. We have 500,000 gas wells in this country, nearly 3,000 in one county, 11 compressor stations belching carcinogenic air emissions in a tiny town of only two square miles. Our bodies and our ecosystems can absorb a certain amount of abuse and still bounce back. But at a certain point, it's just too much, and the insults overwhelm the resilience. Take Pennsylvania, for example. In the beginning, Pennsylvania was letting the frackers take their wastewater, which is contaminated with very high levels of salt, to sewage treatment plants, where it was diluted with the sewage, and then discharged into rivers and streams. In short order we had a water quality violation in the drinking water supply for 350,000 people. And what's more, Pennsylvania realized that if they continued to let the frackers take that amount of wastage through its treatment plants, they would salinate every freshwater stream in the state in a period of two years. The same dynamic operates on a global level. Our atmosphere can absorb a certain amount of greenhouse gas emissions. But if we release too much, the climate warms to a point of catastrophic change. And the natural gas boom is taking us to that tipping point, because the way that fracking is done now releases very large amounts of methane into the air. And methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, almost 72 times as potent as carbon dioxide, depending on the time frame that you look at. A recent study showed that the leakage from fracking is about four percent of production and the scientists recognized that at that level gas loses its entire climate advantage over coal when it's burned for electrical power. The intensive development isn't really even good for the industry. Right now the industry is losing money on every dry gas well that's drilled. But it's even worse for solar, wind, and other clean energy sources, because they are displaced when the price of natural gas drops so low. The boom is not only too big, but it's way too fast. It is out ahead of the science. We do know as a result of lots of public pressure that some of the chemicals that are used in this process are toxic, but there are many chemicals that have never even been tested as to their toxicity, and we have no clue what they're going to do to our health or environment, in the short or the long term. We don't know where the wastewater that stays down below -- and that can be as much as 90 percent of the waste water in the northeastern shale -- is going to migrate in 20, 30 years or more. The development is also way ahead of the protections that we have. Instead of doing science and getting the safeguards before we move forward, we are flooring the accelerator and we're responding to crises. When you move too fast you cut corners and you have accidents, and that's particularly troublesome when you're talking about climate change, because the single most important factor for the social and environmental impact of climate change is the speed at which it progresses. We move too fast with climate change and we don't have time to prepare or to adapt, and so the climate scientists are telling us that we have to address the most potent greenhouse gases right now as fast as we can, and on that list is methane. The hype and the hoopla is clouding our vision and making it impossible for us to hear the facts. There are hundreds of millions of dollars being spent to ensure that this industry can continue to operate without the science and without the protections we need. $320 million spent on lobbying the federal government in just two years. As a result, what we are hearing now is not how we're going to end our addiction to fossil fuels, but instead, a hundred years of gas. Now, a hundred years of gas is based on extracting every molecule of gas from all of our reserves, even those that we haven't actually discovered yet, when it is well known that only about 10 percent of those reserves tend to be economically feasible to develop. And if we switch our power plants over to gas and our transportation systems over to gas, and our heating and cooking systems, and then on top of that we export liquid natural gas to other countries, how long is that abundant resource going to last? And at what price to our health and environment? The boom mentality produces magical thinking. The idea that this industry is going voluntarily to abide by a golden rule or a golden age of gas is just a fairy tale. This industry fights every protection we try to put in place, federal and state, often when it's even in its economic interests to comply. What all this means is that we are in the middle of an uncontrolled experiment. If we get this wrong, there is no turning back. And so we need to take the opportunity now when, we have a glut and we are not desperate for gas, to do the science and get the protections in place before it's too late and the natural gas boom that l ooks so exciting now goes bust in the face of the next generation.

    "data":"Good evening, everybody. Joe told you about the upsides of the natural gas boom, and Deborah and Kate told you about some of the risks. I just want to start by saying if it were only as simple as my opponents tell you, then life would be pretty easy. Let me tell you why their position, that the costs of developing natural gas are simply not worth the benefits, is wrong. First, what they didn't tell you is that there is absolutely nobody in the United States, no entity, that could actually introduce this proposition and make it so. There are hundreds of millions of decision makers in our energy system. If we rely on a regulated market, consumers and suppliers all around the country, every one of you is making energy choices every day, they don't have the authority to completely stop this, no single state could stop this, nor could the federal government. On the consumer side, Americans tend not to think very much about energy. What they think about is getting to their job or getting to the shop where they hope to find lots of options, whether they can power their computers, or keep their homes warm or cool, and it's those realities that people don't think about energy that much. That makes this a really hard issue to deal with. Everybody wants energy 24/7. They want it pretty cheap. Many say they'd like it to be clean, and many really suffer when prices go up. That's the reality, and that makes this issue very gray and not as black and white as my opponents would tell you. Deborah and Kate have set up in some sense a false dichotomy. They make it seem as though natural gas is evil and so everything else is pure. We know that that's not the case. Surely we should be developing more wind and solar power. I'm sure everyone in this audience agrees with that. Right now, seven percent of America's energy supply comes from renewable energy; most of that is from the Roosevelt-era hydroelectric facilities, those gigantic projects, none of which we would be able to build again for environmental impact reasons. The other major portion of renewables right now comes from biofuels such as ethanol, with its own problems from an environmental impact point of view. Wind and solar are expected to grow, but even if they're 10 times as much as they are today, we're still talking about a long way to go and a small portion of the supply, and I hope we get there. It's very hard. But these and every other energy choice are really pretty hard and very complicated. Why else would Japan be restarting its nuclear plants so soon after the Fukushima disaster? It's because they need energy. Why else would Pennsylvania be opening up its shale gas resources for development? They'd like some jobs and economic benefits associated with it. And, in fact, why are coal states fighting so hard against the U.S. EPA Air Toxics Rules that would reduce the amount of coal burning in coal fired power plants? Surely the coal industry has something to do with that, but also there are a lot of jobs in that state tied to coal. So what has clean cheap gas provided for us in this pretty gray landscape so far? Joe told you about how natural gas is taking market share from coal in the power sector right now. In 2012 alone, Southern Company, which is one of the biggest owners of a coal fired power plant fleet in the country, expects to generate almost half of its power from natural gas. That's three times the amount from gas as it was five years ago. And this is astonishing. Coal has dropped from 70 percent of its fleet to 30 percent of its fleet -- of power generation. Now, certainly in a compartmentalized way, Americans often get really agitated about energy choices, but it's usually when it hits their backyard, as Kate and Deborah have told you. Unfortunately, every form of energy is in somebody's backyard. Many communities are split about shale gas. Absolutely that's true. Of course, some communities are split when they think that there's going to be a Wal-Mart coming because it affects the quality and tenor of their life in those areas. But think about it, every type of energy facility that you can think of has split communities, whether it's a wind farm in Cape Cod, the power lines across the Midwest to tie the America's Saudi Arabia of wind to the people using wind in other parts of the country, nuclear plants, the case for shutting down existing coal plants, splits communities apart. These splits typically come down to jobs versus the environment, and that's surely the case here. Where I do agree with Kate and Deborah is that shale gas development does have important environmental and community impact. Should we regulate natural gas development more? Absolutely we should. Is regulation improving? Absolutely it is. Colorado and Pennsylvania are the prime cases for adv ancements that are leapfrogging for best practices. The federal government is, too. Should we drop the so-called Halliburton loophole, which exempts water injections associated with hydraulic fracturing from the Safe Drinking Water Act? Why not? Wouldn’t that provide a lot of more public trust than we have right now? Should we tighten up emissions of methane from the whole process? Absolutely we should. But do we think that the United States should take shale gas off the table? No. That's unrealistic. It's not even sensible. If we somehow -- someone in the United States could decide to do that, because it did more harm then good, what would we get? We'd probably get a little bit more renewables, maybe a little faster. We would get a lot more coal use, and we'd have mountaintop mining, we'd have coal ash piles, some of which have recently spilled into rivers, we'd have much higher CO2 emissions that contribute to global warming, and we'd have unhealthy levels of mercury emissions and other toxic chemicals. There's a solution to all of these issues. There are best practices. There should be much more aggressive attention to this. What I really wish is that people would stop demonizing this fuel, because it makes it impossible to find sensible solutions in the middle. There are sensible solutions in the middle. We should be working on enabling those to develop over time. Our main argument is that the two principal sources of energy in the United States, coal and oil, are much more damaging to the environment than is natural gas, and that's for the communities where those are used as well as to the nation as a whole.

    "data":"Thank you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Paul Butler, and I represent the people. When I was a prosecutor, that's how I would start my opening statements. I put a lot of people in prison; I was a soldier in the war on drugs, and tonight I'm going to give you a soldier's perspective on why that war is a colossal failure. Later, Nick will talk about how the war on drugs has compromised our democracy and made us all less free. And he'll also talk about what legal regulation of drugs would look like. Will you be able to go into Whole Foods and buy cocaine? Nick will tell you about the experiences of countries all over the world that have safely legalized drugs. As a prosecutor, I learned that as many people as I locked up, we weren't making a dent in the drug trade; we were actually making neighborhoods less safe. I was prosecuting a lot of 19- and 20-year-olds for nonviolent drug offenses. Locking up these young people with a bunch of hardcore rapists and murderers was like sending them to finishing school for criminals. When these kids came home, they had learned how to be really good bad guys. If we legalize drugs, we will stop the counter-productive practice of treating kids the same that we treat violent criminals, and we would all be safer. Maybe my work as a prosecutor would've been worth the enormous social cost if it was getting drugs off the street, but we all know the war on drugs doesn't do that. No country has ever found a way to prevent people from using drugs. The United States locks up more people than any country in the history of the world. We have 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's prisoners. It costs us billions of dollars that we just cannot afford, and it's just as easy to get drugs now as it always has been. What about drug addicts? It turns out that the small percentage of people who use drugs who become addicts, we know that treatment is a more effective solution than punishment for those people. Most of us are lucky, we don't have a crack head or a meth addict in our family, but everybody's got an alcoholic in the family; tobacco might be a close second, but I think we all agree that alcohol is probably the worst drug, right? If you think of it in terms of dysfunctional families, laws, economic productivity, health problems, the people who commit crimes under the influence. But is the answer to make using alcohol a crime? Of course not. We tried that during Prohibition and it just did not work. All we did was create this illegal, violent market for liquor just like for other drugs now, and we didn't stop anybody who wanted to, from drinking, just like we don't stop anybody now from using drugs. So I'm speaking based on my research as a law professor, my work as a prosecutor, and also, my life experience. Ladies and gentlemen, there's a lot of hypocrisy in the war on drugs, but I want to respect you enough to keep it real. Like most Americans, I have used illegal drugs. I wasn't introduced to them at my all-black public elementary school in Chicago, and at my Catholic high school, a lot more kids drink than smoke weed. The first time I was around a lot of people who used drugs was actually at Yale, where I went to college. And then at Harvard, where I went to law school. I'm glad I never got caught when I smoked pot, and I'm also glad that Barack Obama was not arrested and prosecuted for any of the times that he used cocaine and marijuana. My opponents are honorable men, and it makes me wonder if they really practice what they preach. As you listen to the good doctor Theodore, here's one thing you should keep in mind. He has actually prescribed heroin to addicts. He did it because he knows that addicts need to be treated, not punished. As a practicing physician, he understood that drug dependency is a medical issue, not a crime. And I read a profile of Mr. Hutchinson and he's a wonderful family man; I had the pleasure of meeting his wife, Susan. And I wonder what a father, a great father like Mr. Hutchinson would say if one his children called and said she was using cocaine. Would he really say,  Wait a minute, honey,  and whisper to his wife,  Quick, dial 911, tell the police they need to arrest out daughter; she needs to be prosecuted and locked up.  Of course not, none of us would do that to our family or friends. So my final point, ladies and gentlemen, is, respectfully, what is good enough for our children and our friends is good enough for African-Americans. We call it a war on drugs but it's mainly a war on black people; they're the people who get stopped and frisked. Last year in New York City, 50,000 people got arrested for marijuana possession, 50,000, almost 90 percent were black or Latino. That's not who really uses drugs. The National Institute  of Health tells us that black people don't use drugs more than any other group. They're about 12 percent of drug users. What about sellers? Most drug buyers report buying from someone of their own race. White kids in Scarsdale, they don’t have to go to the hood to buy. They get their weed and Ecstasy and Adderall from other white skids in Scarsdale. But who gets locked up for drug crimes? Almost two-thirds are black, 12 percent of people who do the crime, 60 percent of people who do the time. And that's selective prosecution, and it's devastated the African-American community. We have one black president and one million black people in prison. The book  The New Jim Crow  tells us that because of the war on drugs there are more African-Americans under criminal justice supervision now than there were slaves in 1850. Think about the catastrophic effect that has on families. In the black community, we have a lot of women and children who are doing time on the outside. the war on drugs there are more African-Americans under criminal justice supervision now than there were slaves in 1850. Think about the catastrophic effect that has on families. In the black community, we have a lot of women and children who are doing time on the outside. So, again, the most responsible way to deal with the problems of illegal drug use is to not punish people for using drugs. The reality is, for my opponents, this will never -- this is just a nice rhetorical debate. The odds are that their children will use drugs, and they will never be touched by the criminal justice system. The odds for African-American children are very different. And that just seems profoundly unfair. My friends, as a civilized society, we shouldn't punish people for being sick. We shouldn't put anybody in a cage based on what they put in their mouths. There's a better way. It's to legalize drugs. "

    "data":"Thank you. What an exciting evening to debate an important subject for our country and for our future. Paul, great job in your opening remarks. An African-American who also happens to be in a leadership position in the United States attended the summit of the Americas in Colombia, South America. He said it is okay for us to debate the pros and cons of the war on drugs. But, quote,  I personally, in my administration, position is that legalization is not the answer,  end quote. That was President Barack Obama. I happen to agree with President Barack Obama. I agree that there are changes that need to be made as we look at how we enforce our laws. I agree that we need to have a robust debate about incarceration policies and what we are doing in our fight against illegal drugs and how much we're devoting to rehabilitation. All of those issues are appropriate to be on the table. So there needs to be changes. Paul mentioned that we need to reduce racial disparities in enforcement. That's why I have worked very hard to reduce the cocaine, the crack, and powder cocaine disparity that impacts racially across America. We've reduced that disparity. We've made a correction to the system. We need to reduce our incarceration rates. That's why I'm engaged on the Right on Crime initiative and initiatives that encourage our state legislatures to look at incarceration policies. And in Texas and in Arkansas and in South Carolina, they have reduced the incarceration rates for drug offenders, both to save money, but also to reexamine our policies. I believe we need to improve alternatives to incarceration. That's why I've been a supporter of drug treatment courts that provide accountability with treatment so that it can be an effective treatment, and it has a great success story across America. So why -- why did the president take the position that legalization is not the answer? Perhaps he understood the success that we have achieved whenever we look at the fact that drug use has been cut in half over the last 30 years in our country. Did he want to preside -- and I know people -- I see some skeptical looks when I say that. That is in your program. That is part of the debate topic and the acknowledgment that, over the last 30 years, drug use has been cut in half in our country. And we have a president that says he does not want to see it go up on his watch. Could it be that he does not believe that the United States ought to break its treaty obligations in which we've entered into and been a leader across the globe? And that is reason enough to vote against the proposition. Or perhaps he was thinking about his own daughters and his grandchildren, and would there be greater potential for them to be engaged in drug use that he might believe is harmful in -- whenever we continue to have it illegal in our country? And so the president made that decision both personally, he said, and with his administration. Let's look at the argument that's been presented. And first, I would say I've been introduced as a former administrator of the DEA. That is absolutely true. I'm also a front line prosecutor, a former prosecutor in Arkansas that's prosecuted cocaine cases and marijuana cases and on down the line, primarily of traffickers. And my experience is just the opposite of Paul. In fact, when I went into a store recently to sign up for some exercise, the owner came up and said,  You put me in prison.  I thought I was going to be thrown out of the place. But he looked at me, and he said,  I wanted to thank you for helping to turn my life around, because I was going down the wrong path of addiction. I was going down the wrong path of violation of the law, and it turned me around.  And today he owns his own business. And so I've had a totally different experience as former federal prosecutor. They say the current model of prohibition is not working. Well, while that might appeal to the popular culture, it does not pass muster in close examination. In fact, drug usage is down over the last 30 years. Whenever you look at our war on poverty that president Lyndon Johnson proclaimed, what, 30, 35 years ago, whenever he proclaimed that, have we eliminated poverty today? Does that mean, because we have not eliminated poverty that we should stop fighting hunger? Of course not. Well, we call it a war on drugs, which is not my preferred terminology. I believe it is an effort to save lives. It is our youth. It is our families, it is our communities at stake. How do you decrease harmful drugs in our community? Is it by legalization or is it by our present method of saying, let's improve the system. Let's make it better. But let's don't throw it out and say we're going to just turn off the spigot and make everything legal. Secondly, they talk about harm. If you believe that addictive and mind-altering drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine are harmful, if you believe that they are harmful, then ask this question. If you legalize, will it increase or decrease the use and the availability of harmful drugs? Now, if you believe that they're not harmful, I'm not sure I can win your debate. But if you believe they're harmful, ask the fundamental question, will it increase or decrease usage? Now, Paul made the point that you look at -- you know more alcoholics today than you do people who are drug addicts. But did ending prohibition on alcohol increase or decrease alcohol consumption in the United States of America? And if you increase drug usage, will it increase drug addiction, harmful reaction to it? They cannot show -- and I believe the burden is on them -- they cannot show that logically and over history, that if you decriminalize, if you legalize harmful drugs, the usage is going to go down. That has  not been the experience in the Netherlands. It's not been the experience in the United Kingdom. It's not been the experience in Alaska. It has not been the experience in Canada. Usage has gone up. And so, finally, in my opening, they ask me -- or Paul mentioned my family. Well, if my children came to me, and there was a drug issue, my first concern is, where are they getting those drugs? What is the availability? How can we shut that down? And as a parent, it would scare me to death to think that there is going to be easy availability, increased availability and that you can find heroin and methamphetamine just as acceptable in our society as alcohol. That creates a problem as a parent in my mind. "

    "data":"I do want to point out in all fairness that being among the foremost libertarians in America means that myself and my coauthor, you know, that's basically it. So, you know, you've heard from a self described soldier in the drug war. You've heard from a general, a commander, former Drug Enforcement Administration personnel in the drug war. You'll hear from a medic in the drug war. I present myself simply as a conscientious objector in the war on drugs. Let me explain a bit of why I think we should legalize drugs. And the first -- I want to make two large points. First is, let's look at this war on drugs which is supposedly -- you know, the light is at the end of the tunnel, we're going to bring the troops home by Christmas. This is what Asa Hutchinson was saying, essentially, when he's saying,  Look, you know, it's been working pretty well these past 30 years. Drug use is down. If we get rid of the war on drugs, drug use will go up.  So I want to talk about that. And then I want to address some of the things that Paul previewed for you. And, first and foremost, I want to make this statement. And half of you in this audience, if you are representative, are with me in your action in what economists call revealed preference. You know, using drugs is not immoral. It is not addictive for 99 percent of people. And there's nothing wrong with it or to be ashamed about with it. Look, any program -- it's not a war on drugs, it is a war on racial, ethnic, and age-based minorities, because it's kids who get wrapped up in the war on drugs; it's not old people. Any program that has such disparate impacts as the ones that Paul was talking about should come under scrutiny regardless of its intentions and its champions. As a 2005 cost benefit analysis of the war on drugs, by the super conservative American Enterpriser Institute, which looked at the effectiveness, the conclusion by David Boyum and Peter Reuter was American drug policy has little to show by way of success for that $2.5 trillion that John mentioned at the beginning of the program. And they claim it is surely reasonable to ask those who would maintain the status quo for some basis for believing the additional expense and suffering of putting hundreds of thousands of people a year in jail are justified. Another AEI scholar -- and AEI, you'll remember it from the Iraq and Afghanistan war, this is a think tank that has never met a war it doesn't like -- Mark Perry, a n economist at AEI, has pointed out that between 1970 and 2010 annual spending on drug control has gone up 10 times, adjusted for inflation, while the addiction rate has remained flat. In other words, we have become other place where we stand for that kind of massive increase in spending with flat or declining results is public education, which is no model for any kind of program going forward. Across every conceivable front, the war on drugs is losing the battle for hearts and minds. A recent Rasmussen poll just -- you know, which is a right leaning pollster, 8 percent of people think we're winning the war on drugs. A century of failure, because it starts with the 1914 Harrison Narcotics Act or Controlled Substances Act, has finally woken Americans up to the simple fact that prohibition exacerbates all of the social problems it is supposed to ameliorate. It doesn't make things better, it makes everything worse. Despite attempts to control -- to stem the supply of drugs, the amount and quality of drugs continues to go up while the inflation adjusted price goes down. As Washington State and Colorado were voting to legalize marijuana, Californians voted to change its mandatory sentencing laws that grew out of concern about drug crime because its prisons are choked by non-violent drug offenders while they have to let rapists and murderers out. The Rand Corporation and other think tanks have found no consistent correlation between a nation's legal regime towards drugs and use rate. So in some countries you have lax drug laws and high use rates or low use rates. In places like America we have stern drug laws and high use rates. It's not clear what's going on; we do know in Portugal, which decriminalized all drugs, that use rates and addiction rates went down, because people got better information and they were more willing to come forward before they developed problems. So, if you're concerned on the effects of drug use on a society, you should reject the failed policies pursued by often well-meaning, but seriously misinformed drug warriors, also known as the loyal opposition here. Well, such basic empirical scrutiny alone should convince all observers to consider an unconditional surrender in what is rightly called America's longest war. I want to make a brief case for what I call pharmacological freedom, or granting adult Americans the broadest possible rights to choose what substances we put into our bodies. And here is where I go into the meth round, because I'm running out of time. This should be recognized. Pharmacological freedom should be recognized as a basic right. Over the past several decades, we have become a drug-taking culture, and we all believe in what DuPont used to advertise as  better living through chemistry.  We take drugs to change our cholesterol levels, to change our work habits, to change our moods. None of this is going away, nor should it. We do all sorts of things to make ourselves look and feel better. To the extent that we might be able to use drugs that are currently arbitrarily deemed illicit, not just illegal, but illicit, by the government, the better. Ladies and gentlemen, if we don't have the right, literally, to change our mind through our personal choices, what rights do we have that are worth a damn? Now, drug legalization is not a scary prospect. It's not the radical change that its champions claim not its opponents fear. And let me -- as I'm winding down, how many of you have tried an illegal drug? Raise your hand. Anybody carrying? And if so -- okay. I'll talk to you later. "

    "data":"Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's alleged by the proposers of this motion that the harms that arise from illicit drug taking, production, and distribution arise because of their illegality, and not because of their nature, and that, therefore, if we could only just go down to our local corner store to pick up crack, or [unintelligible], or methamphetamine, or heroine, or LSD, et cetera, whenever we've run out, the harms would be eliminated and very much reduced. And, incidentally, Portugal has not legalized drugs, and no country has. Anyway, it is not so that the harms arise from illegality. In this country, about as many people now die annually from opioid poisoning as from homicide. Those people -- opioids are overwhelming prescription drugs obtained perfectly legally. About 15,000 a year die of these drugs. But the supply and demand of them arose suddenly in a matter of a handful of years. And it was all nice and above board. There are now said to be 2 million addicts to these drugs, and all, as I said, created perfectly legally. And this is all within a decade, more or less a decade. Now, I suppose that our libertarian opponents would say that the problem here the control exercised over the supply by the mafia, the medical mafia, that is. And if only the drugs were really freely available on a truly open market, if only the medical mafia was sidelined, all would be well. Well, you can't expect me as a doctor really to agree with that proposition. This example shows that supply can produce a large and disastrous demand. Another example is the diversion on a massive scale of a drug called buprenorphine which is used very widely in France in the treatment of heroin addicts. And it's diverted to Georgia. That's the ex-Soviet Union republic of Georgia. According to the Lancet, 250,000 people in that country, that is more than 1 in 20 of the population, are now addicted to the drug diverted from France, which again shows quite apart from casting doubt on how badly the addicts needed or wanted the drug in the first place, how a perfectly legal drug can create an enormous sudden and disastrous demand. Our opponents would have to allege that had buprenorphine been legally available in -- to the Georgians, none of this would have happened. In Scotland, as a whole, and in Dublin, more people are now dying of a perfectly legal drug, methadone, first developed to help the late Hermann Goering to get through the war without withdrawal symptoms from heroin, then from heroin. And this drug is used in supposed treatment of heroin addiction. So the legal drug is now killing more than the illegal drug. So it's not true that the harms of drugs arise only from their illegality. We've seen that even if ever homicide in this country, every single one, with a result of the illicit trade in drugs, which is an absurd proposition, deaths from legally obtained opioids would equal to deaths from that trade. And that demand was created very, very quickly. It's also alleged by the proposals that criminality is caused, more or less, by the illegality of drugs. And again, this is not so. In the prison in which I worked, I discovered that the heroin addicts who were imprisoned there and had committed -- they had committed between 50 and 200 offenses before they ever took  . Therefore, it will be more true to say that they were addicts because they were criminal than that they were criminal because they were addicts. This has been found elsewhere. And research shows that criminality is a better predictor of addiction than is addiction of criminality. And this can be seen from the career of the writer William S. Burroughs, with which you might be familiar, who, as you know, shot his wife dead. He -- in my opinion, he was an even worse writer than he was a husband. But we don't have any time for literary criticism. The point is that he was fascinated by crime and committed criminal acts well before he became an addict. In the hospital in which I worked, I once walked into the intensive care unit to find two drug dealers who had shot each other at close quarters, but with thorough British incompetence, had failed to kill one another. Well, what do you suppose that such people would be doing if they were not shooting at one another? Would they have been doing remedial teaching, for example, or deciphering cuneiform script in the British museum? It's absurd. And criminal -- criminal gangs are not going to file for bankruptcy if drugs are legalized. They're going to change their activities. So making the importation or production, distribution, and sale of drugs would be dangerous, and it would not have the claimed benefits because the illegality of drugs is the occasion and not the cause of crime. And therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote against the motion. "

My favorite story I think about policymakers is a story about a man who was traveling across the country in a hot air balloon, and at a certain point he realized that he was lost, he had no idea where he was, so he decided that he would lower the balloons and see if he could see some recognizable landmarks. So he lowered the balloon, couldn't see anything that he recognized, no Golden Gate bridge, no Washington Monument, so he had no idea where he was. So he kept lowering the balloon, and when he got to about 30 feet above ground he saw a man working in the field. So he yelled out,  Where am I?  and the man stopped digging in the field, and he said,  Well, you're in a hot air balloon about 30 feet above ground.  Well, the man in the balloon said,  You sound like a scientist. Do you work in science?  And the man on the ground said,  My goodness, I am a scientist. But how in the world did you know that?  Said,  Well, I knew that because what you told me is technically correct but it is of absolutely no use to me right now.  Well, not to be outdone, the man on the ground said,  Well, you sound like one of those policymakers from Washington or somewhere.  And the man in the balloon said,  I am. I'm an outstanding policymaker. I'm a leader. But how did you know that?  And the man on the ground said,  I knew that because you're in the same position you were when we met, you don't know where you are, you don't know where you're going, and now you're blaming me.  Well, let me say that I spent nine years in government, five as director of the CDC, and as you've heard, four as surgeon general and assistant secretary for health, and I have to tell you, I would trade nothing for those nine years. They were rich years. The people with whom I worked were special. So I am very excited about the role of government in dealing with a problem like obesity. Let me just say a few of the things I was involved in. In 1996, while director of CDC, we released a very interesting report on physical activity. It was actually released as a surgeon general's report, and basically what we showed in that report on physical activity was that there was a dramatic decline in physical activity among the American people, including schools no longer requiring physical education, K through 12. And so we expressed a lot of concerns about the sedentary lifestyles of American people and the implications of that. In 1999, I represented the United States at a world conference on health promotion and disease prevention. And at that conference for the first time I released the surgeon general's Prescription [to the American People], which I'm sure many of you are familiar with, but among the things on that prescription was the recommendation for regular physical activity, at least 30 minutes a day, at least five days a week, but also a recommendation that the American people consume at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day. There were other things on the prescription, even one having to do with mental health and the need to have some planned strategy for dealing with stress. We didn't really understand at that time the relationship between things like physical activity and depression, the fact that physical activity is a major intervention for reducing depression. Then in 2001, as surgeon general and assistant secretary for health, I released the surgeon general's Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Overweight and Obesity. That report, among other things, pointed out that between 1980 and the year 2000 there had been a tripling of overweight and obesity among children in this country and a doubling among adults. So we did sound the alarm, and even though I was former director of the CDC and we are very selective at what we call  epidemics,  usually reserved for infectious diseases, we declared that overweight and obesity was an epidemic in this country. We didn't realize at that time that the same thing was beginning to happen all over the world. In that report of the surgeon general on overweight and obesity, we especially expressed concern about the changes in the maps throughout the country, where you could actually map the increase in overweight and obesity in various states, wherea s in 1990, 15 percent was almost the high. By the year 2001, it was 25 to 30 percent of the American people who were obese. What we know about overweight and obesity from a population perspective is very important, I think, to this debate because what we know is that it has increased dramatically, but also that it is clearly associated with an increase in chronic diseases, especially what we call Type II diabetes, or increases in what we call BMI, the way we measure body fat, directly related to an increase in Type II diabetes. And, as you know, Type II diabetes increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and even renal disease. So we were concerned about what was happening in this country. We were concerned about the implication of these rising rates of overweight and obesity. We were also concerned about disparities. We have declared the goal of eliminating disparities in health in this country, especially among different racial and ethnic groups. And what we observed, of course, was that this epidemic was disproportionately impacting African Americans and American Indians. So, American Indians also have the highest rate of Type II diabetes. And African Americans have the highest mortality rates from Type II diabetes. So we were very concerned about the impact that this was having on eliminating disparities in health. We were also concerned about what was happening in children. I think this was really critical. What we found was that children, by increasing overweight and obesity, were now getting what we previously had called adult-onset diabetes. We were seeing it in children. We were seeing hypertension in children. Pediatricians were expressing great concerns. "

    "data":"Thank you. I apologize for holding my hand up. I had hand surgery, and the doctor’s tell me hold it up so it doesn’t get inflamed, so I’m not saluting or doing anything weird like that. So, Dr. Satcher, I hear you and it’s a problem that people have less physical activity. And it would be good if we ate more fruits and vegetables. And it’s terrible that more people have diabetes, but obesity is the government’s business -- that’s a separate issue. It’s a powerful assumption in that, but behind it is the assumption that everything good should be encouraged by government and everything bad discouraged. And at first that sounds like common sense, but everything is arguably, to some degree, helpful or harmful. So, this is a formula for totalitarianism. I mean, why is totalitarianism if not the view that everything falls within the purview of the state? Mussolini said that -- “everything within the state, nothing outside.” Okay, that’s over the top. I’m not saying that government is like a fascist regime, but it’s becoming just as invasive. It spent $3.8 trillion. It’s going broke. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes started using the term “Leviathan” to refer to a powerful central government to which we give up some rights. And he thought Leviathan was a good thing. But he assumed that its function was protecting us from violence. He never imagined that Leviathan would plan our meals. And the founders of this country never imagined that. They started the country with this. This is the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Together it’s this thin. This is what they thought we needed, and this is what made America prosperous. Now, this isn’t everything we should have. We need pollution control rules. They didn’t think about that. But government has gone much further. We now have an agriculture department that spends $145 billion a year. Government runs public housing, a war on drugs, a welfare state. It subsidizes farmers and, by doing that, does harm, as Robert Rosenkrantz said, making people fatter. It runs school lunches. It subsidizes students, Indians, researchers, volunteers, small businessmen, rich businessmen, polices the world and polices our home and our jobs, our bedrooms. And now food too? Well, yes. But if it weren't already doing all -- trying to do all that stuff and doing it badly, it could better do what it's supposed to, protect us from criminals and terrorists. And America wouldn't be going broke. But look, I have lost that argument. We libertarians have argued that we're in the minority. I understand that. Most of you disagree. Most of you want more government. You like the minimum wage. You like the EEOC to protect us against discrimination, Title 9 to protect us against gender discrimination, rules against sexual harassment language being used in workplaces, the ADA to protect disabled people, laws against prostitution and online gambling. And in the name of health and safety, you support laws requiring motorcycle helmets and OSHA to protect the workers, and the CSPC to protect kids from dangerous toys, and the whole alphabet soup of agencies that keep growing in Washington. And my debate partner, Paul, he agrees with that. He says government ought to intervene in these areas. But even he says not obesity, because obesity is different, and government sucks at dealing with it. But he's the obesity expert. I'll let him explain that. All I know is that government keeps growing, and that is dangerous to our freedom. Now the president wants to spend another 300 million or so of your dollars to pay for his wife's healthy foods financing initiative. And of course, that's in addition to all the stuff we already have, the  let's move  campaign, the task force on childhood obesity, the school lunch program, the council on fitness and so on. What's the result of all that stuff? Since they created it, they spent a lot of your money on it, people are fatter than ever. And that's just what the Feds spend. The states and localities spend even more. I mean, New York City now bans bake sales in schools. How much has that helped? My colleague, Mike Huckabee when he was governor of Arkansas, he required every school to measure every kid's body mass index. Dr. Satcher mentioned that. It's a measure based on the height-weight ratio. It's a terrible measure. I mean, BMI index says that George Clooney and Tom Cruise are overweight and Arnold Schwarzenegger is obese. It just mismeasures people, but it's required now in Arkansas. For every kid, they get a report card that doesn't just give their arithmetic score. It tells the parents what their BMI index is. The result? Well, I don't think it's helped them teach arithmetic because the teachers are distracted. But the kids are just as fat. It's made no difference in obesity in the schools. Some states say, we ought to have some taxes, taxes on bad food. And intuitively, this makes sense. Let's tax candy and, oh, then they'll eat less candy. They'll eat more fruits and vegetables. So Illinois did that. Six percent tax on candy. But what's the result? It's just confusing. What is candy? They decide, okay, a Hershey bar is candy, but a Kit Kat bar, that's food because it's got flower in it. So this enriches the bureaucrats and the lawyers, but it doesn't help anybody lose  weight. In New York City, the government requires calorie counts now to be posted in restaurants. And that makes sense. Information is good. So NYU did a study of that and found that, yes, adults say they were influenced by the calorie postings. But then they checked the receipts, and they found the people ordered slightly more calories. Government can't make us thinner. Government can't control our personal behavior in that way. And even if it could, we're spending $3.8 trillion going broke. We couldn't afford to do this even if it worked. We don't need government to do this. There are only two ways to do things in life: voluntary or force. Government is force. We need some force to keep us safe. But voluntary is better. And voluntary abounds. We have plenty of diet information. All these diet websites, books on nutrition, TV shows like The Biggest Loser, diet gurus are celebrities. That's enough. We don't need government taking our money, and we don't need government force.

    "data":"Obesity is the government's business. You hear from the opposing side that we're looking at a nanny state or food policing. Au contraire, that's not what we're looking for at all. Voluntary? We give you voluntary. That's what we're looking for. I wear many hats. I'm a physician first, and I hail from the front trenches, face to face with my patients and as chief lifestyle expert for WebMD's 90 million members, click to click with my cyber folks. This is where I practice high-tech touch. I set up a discussion group asking, is obesity the government's business? It lit up like Kyoto at nighttime. It was fabulous. The bottom line was, yes, obesity is the government's business for leadership, education, protection, options, opportunities, infrastructure. No sidewalk, no walk. No park, no play. No bike path, lots of accidents. Bottom line, what they said was,  No blame, no shame. No tax, no bans.  They drew a line in the sand. And Dr. Satcher and I agree with that. Obesity is the government's business. I'm going to flip now to my public health hat. Government cannot solve the obesity problem alone. A problem as large as obesity, pun fully intended, requires all sectors of society to bring our thinking to the table. So I argue for government private sector partnerships. Shouldn't be just the government at all. When we initiate a voluntary campaign or an effort, we want to be able to offer people options and opportunities because if there is no choice, there can be no moderation. We're in New York City. I love this place. And although you just heard that some of what you're doing isn't working so well, I say, forget all that. You have programs here, for instance, Mayor Bloomberg has joined with 500 other mayors with the  let's move cities and town  campaign to be able to work, drill down into the neighborhoods. What we can do to be able to improve physical activity as well as nutrition. In addition, the  fresh  program, food retailed expansion to support health programs. Say that three times. The food retail expansion to support health program has set up 14 supermarkets in food deserts. This was a private-public collaboration, a partnership that worked. We now have fresh produce out there. And that's really important. Of course, we have so many other measures that have taken place. Good grief, we have play streets. We've taken quiet streets and turned them into play yards because we have nothing else out there. We're using what we can. We're doing what we can. At the national level, obviously we're looking at prevention now. The national prevention and health promotion strategy to stop disease before it starts. Million hearts campaign. Let's Move actually celebrates its second anniversary this month alone. And it's been reaching out to everyone from REI for outdoor, you know, to a beverage industry for clear on calories so you can begin to understand what's going on in those labels. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. Is it voluntary, and does it touch people's lives? Hell yeah. I'm on the board of America on the Move, and we're moving. We have corporate sponsors. We do private, public sponsorships all year long. We do this in neighborhoods, in states all across this country. We touch people. Exercise is Medicine, I am their national spokesperson, a collaboration of the American Medical Association as well as the American College of Sports Medicine. And here we see again trying to show people that there are simple, small steps, literally, that you can take to be able to help yourself, voluntary, nothing stuffed up your nose. We're not going to the tax and ban place. We're not food policing. We're reaching out asking people to hold our hand and say, come on. We can do this together. Is it sloppy? Yeah. Are we perfect? No. We're about as perfect as the people who create them and implement them. We're human. We're getting there. I'm going to switch over to my last hat for my seven minutes as a researcher. Guess what? The National Institutes of Health is public funding. $32 billion to save your lives, to do the work we do. It's interesting, when I began my work there as a senior scientist, I went to the clinical director's office, and above the office there was a sign that said,  In God we trust,  and there was a little sign below it that said,  Everyone else must show data.  Fairly straightforward. We wanted to see some good data here. And so in our laboratory we showed the connection between chronic stress for instance and the buildup of that toxic fat deep inside your belly which increases your risk for heart disease and diabetes. We showed for instance that it's not about ELMM,  Eat less, move more.  That's so important, however, so much bigger. We forgot the mind. What about stress? New research has just been published showing that children who are stressed, and you know what that's about, in their childhood, at home, at school, eat more, and that's that stress-fat connection that we talk about so often. What are we doing about that? We have a new science called,  epigenetics,  we're trying to look at how we can literally change gene expression, how we turn on and off genes, by simply doing easy things like if I eat an apple every day on a regular basis I get that gene expression and therefore I'm able to what? Have an increased or decreased vulnerability toward obesity. Or I could just do what so many people do, that nocturnal ménage à trois every night, you know what I'm talking about, you, Ben, and Jerry. All together in bed watching the tube, hanging out, doing it. Doesn't work, all right? What's that gene expression looking like? All right. So here we're looking at something that's a brand new phenomenon, something we love to call  secondhand obesity.  What we're looking at is virally, families, what's going on with them? How are we touching kids? It's so much bigger than demonizing sugar. It's so much bigger, so much bigger than saying the government's just too fat. What we're saying is, putting our hand out, we're trying to say,  Educate, bigger brain, better choices, obesity is the government's business.   "

    "data":"Thank you. I think that the fundamental difficulty here is that, despite the great courtesy of the organizers of this debate to invite me, I'd like to start by pointing out that this debate is framed in completely the wrong way. To have a motion that says,  Obesity is the government's business,  essentially begs the question because using the term  obesity  frames the debate as one which is about the supposedly pathological state of people who have a body mass index of about 30 if they're obese or above 25 if they're overweight. And that in itself essentially tells us that we ought to think about those states as being per se bad and in fact a diseased or a quasi-diseased state. Imagine if this debate were framed as,  Eliminating body diversity is the government's business.  I think that would sound a lot different, but in point of fact there is really -- there is no practical distinction between those two motions. The assumptions at work here are that a narrow range of body weight is normal for human beings and that outside that range a variation is the product of poor lifestyle. Furthermore, it's assumed in the framing of this issue that by reforming poor lifestyle either voluntarily or quasi coercively, you can eliminate abnormal body weight. This is all wrong. There's nothing normal about normal body weight. It's not normal statistically. It's not normal epidemiologically. The overweight category of BMI 25 to 29.9 does not, in fact, feature increased overall health risk, so there isn't even a correlation there between increased health risk and the pathologizing of that body state. The vast majority of people, and I'm going to say this about 27 times tonight, cannot intentionally modify their body mass in a long term fashion successfully. There is no better established proposition empirically in all of medicine than that. In other words, people, as you all know -- well, I shouldn't say  all of you,  but many of you know from personal experience -- find it extraordinarily difficult to change their body weight in a significant long term way voluntarily. Government intervention in this area, and my partner, John Stossel is quite correct in saying that. In comparison to him, I am almost a Stalinist in my enthusiasm for government intervention, although I think he did overstate a couple of my positions. I won’t get into those because that’s beside the point. But in fact, even though I am generally enthusiastic about various forms of government regulation that fill him with dread, I am in fact utterly opposed to government regulation in this area because I think government -- the same as -- obesity as government’s business is almost a kind of dream scenario for a Libertarian. Because a Libertarian could not come up with a better example of government dysfunction than of the notion that we’re supposed to make people thinner, mainly because -- well, for a bunch of reasons, which I want to go through quickly right now and then come back to later. Here I want to emphasize first of all that we do not know an enormous number of things that we would have to know if we were going to have a rational policy that was based on the notion that we were going to make everybody have a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9, the so-called normal range, which for an average height woman would be between 108 and 144 pounds, outside of that supposedly pathological. Here’s what we don’t know. We don’t know how to produce significant long-term weight loss. We just don’t. We don’t know if such weight loss would be beneficial. This hypothesis has not been tested for the very good reason that since we don’t know how to produce it, we can’t test the hypothesis. We don’t know to what extent, if at all, the generally weak associations between obesity and increased health risk are products of a causal relationship as opposed to markers for other things like, for example, dieting, weight cycling, diet drug use, eating disorders, stress, stigma, and lower socioeconomic status. We don’t know why weight went up among Americans in the 1980s and ‘90s. We don’t know why it was stable in the 1960s and ‘70s. We don’t know why it has plateaued over the course of the last 10 years. We don’t in fact know whether people are more sedentary today than they were 40 years ago. We just don’t have the data on that. We just have a few very indirect markers for that, such as the amount of mandatory gym periods in school, but we don’t have any direct measurement of how active people were 40 years ago. We don’t know whether people consume more calories today than they did 40 years ago. Again, the data is not available. People often -- you know, when that’s pointed out to them rather rudely by someone like me, the reaction of public health officials tends to be something like, “Well, it’s just common sense,” right. But see, common sense is what you invoke when you don’t have data, right. That’s why we have these academic institutions, right, so that we don’t just rely on common sense. We actually try to have some evidence for our propositions. Here’s what we do know. We do know that public health interventions designed to produce weight loss do not produce weight loss. This hypothesis has been tested. It’s been tested in situations where we have had intense public health intermediations that are much more intense than those that we could produce on a population-wide scale. And those interventions do not produce weight loss, either in adults or children. We do know that labeling bodies as diseased is stigmatizing, and we know that stigma is very bad for health, as are stress, weight cycling, and eating disorders, which are other things that are produced by this ki nd of labeling. We do know that risk factors that are associated with obesity, like, for instance, hypertension, can be addressed cheaply and successfully through inexpensive drugs that work quite well and increased physical activity, which is beneficial for people of all shapes and sizes whether in fact it produces any weight loss, which it usually doesn’t. Finally, what I really would want to emphasize here above all is that healthy lifestyles don’t eliminate body diversity, which is found among people with a wide variety of body types, many of whom fall outside the phony, so-called normal range. And so, what I would advocate more than anything else is that we ought to focus on a harm reduction, not weight reduction. We’ve already had some indications tonight of the notion that we don’t want to stress people. Here’s a suggestion. Stop telling them that their bodies are pathological because that’s very stressful. That’s not good for people. And if you say that you don’t want to stigmatize obese people but you just want to stigmatize obesity, I would suggest that that is a protocol that’s not going to be successful. Thank you. "

    "data":"I’m used to not making much money. Only tonight did I learn that I was a rapist. This will come as a surprise to my family and friends, who don’t think much of me, but think more than that. If you’ve ever driven through the Midwest on a summer evening, your windshield becomes covered by bazillions of sticky glutinous gobs of insect guts. Your windshield wiper can cause a wreck because it just smears the stuff around, making your windshield as opaque as the directions for assembling a Christmas present. The bugs are corn borer moths. Corn borers cause corn to drop ears, corn stalks to fall over. They also damage the husk of the corn, making it vulnerable to a soil-borne pathogen calle d aflatoxin, which causes liver cancer in humans. The insecticide Bt produced by corn grown from genetically modified seed causes corn borers to swell like a balloon and to explode. I find this very satisfying. I imagine pops, like a string of firecrackers, like popcorn on a hot stove, as all across my fields corn borers explode. Bt corn of course disqualifies my crop as organic, even though a nearly identical pesticide is available to organic farmers. And aflatoxin I should point out is completely natural. Of course, we’ve on our farm lost our chance to be organic some 50 years ago. We have a picture -- we have a picture of my grandfather standing in front of a corn crib. He’s wearing a faded blue work shirt, overalls turned white from repeated washings, a broad-rim straw hat, and he’s carrying two ears of corn, one the before year and one the after, then after had a nitrogen applied to it, artificial raping nitrogen. The after year was much bigger. Grandpa is grinning widely because he’s celebrating a record yield.I should probably point out that our farm has manure as a fertilizer source and at the time planted lots of legumes in long rotations: all practices recommended by the advocates of organic farming, usually writing in a sort of a tone of breathless discovery. Yes,Virginia, people were thinking about soil fertility long before the “Oprah” show covered “Food, Inc.” When commercial fertilizer became available, yields went up, costs went down, including environmental costs, as we use less resources to produce the same amount of food. When this happens in other industries, it’s generally seen as a good thing. The father of the organic method was Sir Albert Howard, a British agriculture scientist. He taught that disease, whether plant, animal, or human, is caused by unhealthy soil, and the secret to good health is farming organically. According to Howard, “The war in the soil is the result of a conflict between the birthright of humanity, fresh food from fertile soil, and the profits of a section of big business.” That sentence could have been written a week ago and would have been just as unrealistic now as it was in 1949 when Howard wrote it. You’ll notice then, as now, the farmer is strangely absent from this narrative. Tools of big corporations bought off by seed corn caps and glossy advertisements, we’re only practicing industrial agriculture because we’re tools of the man. The truth is better captured by that picture of my grandfather smiling from year to year as he celebrates a record yield. You may find this bloodthirsty battle using chemical warfare, genetic manipulation distasteful. It’s clear that our opponents here tonight do so. They imagine farming as a holistic walk with nature as we reap her bounty with hardly a mark left on the landscape and a utopia as we discover that connection to soil has been lost because of the application of science to food. According to them we can walk back our dependence on petroleum, lose our addiction to chemicals and laboratories and be one again with nature. Rarely has so much nonsense received so much attention from so many outstanding minds.Organic production requires its own set of environmental trade-offs. Organic food takes more land than conventional farming for the same amount of food. Organic farming leads directly to more, not less, soil erosion because conventional farmers disturb the soil less. Organic rules are arbitrary with some practices clearly forbidden because of political pressure instead of science. Some of the most environmentally costly practices conventional farmers use are approved for the organic farmer as well. Some of the practices most important for food safety are not available to organic producers. Hunger is the darkest factor of all and always closer than we expect, particularly in the parts of the world that are most likely to farm organically, although they don’t call it that. Nature doesn’t care whether we’re hungry or well-fed. We wrest what we can from her reluctant arms each year, and in order to have an adequate supply of food, we have to use all the tools available to us. That’s the truth. That’s the truth of this multi-front war we call farming, and as inconvenient as it may be to the critics of the present food system, that’s the way it will always be. Eating organically is trendy, edgy, and advocated by all the right people. Organics consumers shop as a form of conspicuous self-congratulation, a chance to pat themselves on the back for their social conscience, and to enjoy the superiority over the coupon-clipping bourgeoisie shopping at Wal-Mart, though organic consumers should know this: her choices have costs, real costs: environmental costs and costs when it comes to world hunger. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, there are a billion hungry people in the world. Every time someone purchases organic food, more water and more land are used to produce that food than to produce the same amount of food on my farm. That’s the reason why you should vote in favor of the motion. Organic food is fashionable, cool, an attitude, a chance to identify yourself with beautiful actresses instead of old farmers in overalls. But mostly, organic food is marketing hype. Thank you."

I started -- well I didn’t start out -- I started out as a lawyer and not as a food critic or a writer, and if this were a court I think I would ask the judge to exclude most of the previous testimony on the grounds that it was totally irrelevant to the proposition.To say that organic food is a marketing hype I guess means that all organic food is a marketing hype, that everything about organic food is a marketing hype. That doesn’t do you any good -- it doesn’t do the other side any good to show that there is an advertisement that shows healthy people by eating organic food, if they actually are. I doubt they’re eating the food on the set -- photographic set. So that’s marketing hype as well. I remember when I was on the FDA-approved advisory committee right at the beginning, and we were given advisory powers, and one of the things that we were given was BST, bovine somatotropin, to increase cows’ milk production. And everything we were fed, except from one -- well you know, from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, was total hype. Monsanto hired the farmers who sat in their offices, working with their computers. Monsanto put overalls on them and everything, and they talked about how they knew that their cows were happy, producing all this extra milk. We know that cows overproducing get mastitis and then there is pus, if I can use the word pus, in the milk. No one wanted to use the word pus. And maybe pus is not bad for you, but I thought it was --The FDA was so afraid that we were going to vote against it, so they combined two committees, also the Animal Husbandry Committee, all of whom were supported by the agriculture department or by industry, for example, Monsanto. So that was  lopsided and have always been lopsided, so much so that the other side was emboldened to move that it should be a crime for a milk producer to announce that there was no bovine somatotropin hormone in his milk because that would be marketing hype since there’s no difference. The forces against good food are very powerful in this country and it’s enough to make you paranoid.With all possible respect, our last speaker -- okay, I’m not going to say that you sounded like Dick Cheney, okay? But ---- but he talked about farming as a multi-front war and that you have to wrest from nature that, you know, these kind of little rewards you, these little, you know, corn cobs. I know four or five farmers, and I’ve spoken to them all in the last few days so that I would be able to learn all about farming. There’s one that I’ll nickname Farmer Al who grows some of the best peaches in the country. They’re organic and they’re in northern California. And it took a while for Al to start switching from non-organic to organic peaches. They’re better now. He was so mellow about it, about how you have to use this in order to avoid that pest. And I asked him whether he used Round-Up on his weeds. He said, “Oh no, we just manage the weeds.” Just as long as they’re not -- -- just as long as they’re not higher than about that, they won’t threaten the plants, the weeds won’t and also scattering eggs of predators to the pests and so on and so forth. Al’s peaches are more expensive. There’s no doubt that organic food is on average more expensive, so our next speaker, I believe having read some of what he’s written, are going to say, as the farmer did, that it’s almost a crime with all the people starving to devote any resources to some kind of elite food. Now, I know that the best vegetables that I’ve ever tasted were organic, and hey were grown on Dan Barber’s property -- he doesn’t own the property; Rockefeller owns the property -- but the property near his restaurant. Conventional agriculture is not feeding the world.To say that organic agriculture could never feed the world is sidestepping the fact that organic -- that conventional agriculture is not feeding the world and it’s dependent upon oil selling at $45 a barrel, it’s dependent upon steady climate, and it’s also dependent upon relatively available water."

    "data":"To measure the depths of my sins, I’m holding up a book written by my son, Alex Avery. It’s entitled “The Truth about Organic Foods” and it traces the history of the movement from Germany in the 1920s on to our organic farming today, and the tragedy that organic farming doesn’t live up to the hype. The people who are buying it and consuming it and offering it to their families truly want to do the best possible thing, as speakers tonight have said, and I certainly don’t disagree with that. But this is not just an unfortunate failure to live up to the billing. It is now a serious international concern, because we are about to enter the biggest farming challenge the world has ever seen. We will have, by the year 2050, between 8 and 9 billion people. I expect that instead of 1.5 billion affluent people, science, technology, and trade will give us 7 billion affluent people. And if the Chinese reach half of the pet saturation that we have in this country, that will mean another 250 million companion cats and dogs; none of them vegetarian. We will need to double world food production again. We will need to triple  the yields on the best farmland, because that not only gives the highest yields and the least erosion, it displaces the fewest wildlife species. The Great Plains had 60 million bison, 100 million antelope, 3 billion prairie dogs. That’s three species. The poor land has more, far more, species. We are farming 37 percent of the land area now. If we produce for 2050 by simply extending the borders of the fields we’ll be farming 80 percent of the land area. And if you think conventional farming isn’t feeding people now, just wait. And the organic farmers can’t do this. The key is nitrogen. The Earth had 1.5 billion people before we got nitrogen fertilizer. We would still be at 1.5 billion people were it not -- that might be better. You might think you prefer that, but you aren’t going to get there with zero population growth movements, and you aren’t going to get there with meatless Mondays. You’re going to have to triple the yields again on the best farmland. Plowing itself is a danger. Summer of ’07, 12-inch rainfall in southeastern Minnesota, second largest concentration of organic farmers in the country. They not only had flooding; they had mudslides. Whole hillsides sloughed off. Sandy loam hills should not have been in anything but no till farming. No-till cuts erosion by 65 to 95 percent. It doubles soil moisture. It’s the most sustainable farming system ever developed. And organic farmers can’t use it because you have to have herbicides to kill the cover crops so you can plant what you really want to grow. They can’t kill their cover crops. And the yields over all are about half as high. We had a famous study that came out in the summer of 2007 from the University of Michigan, which has no school of agriculture. The lead author was a fullyqualified geologist. And they said organic farming can feed the world and more. You’re entitled to believe that, but they made a fairly serious mistake in the paper. They talked about one study in which green manure crops had put 1,500 milligrams per acre of nitrogen into the soil and that 66 percent of this nitrogen had been delivered to the seedheads of the crops. That doesn’t happen. Everybody agrees that nitrogen fertilizer puts a higher percentage of its nitrogen into the crop seeds. Thirty-three percent is the accepted figure. On green manure crops it’s 20 percent. The different between 66 percent and 20 percent is starvation for half of the humans, or the destruction of wildlife habitat on a scale never yet seen in this world. This is not truth, and it is not a favor to you or to the population of the rest of the world to tell something about organic farming that is demonstrably false. We will have to turn high-yield farming into higher-yield farming. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Thank you, John, very much. First of all, I think I need to start with an apology to my esteemed colleagues on the pro side of this debate, because I’m actually going to speak to the motion. Tonight we’re debating whether organic food is marketing hype, and the way that I understood this -- and I think probably most of the people on our side -- is that we’re talking about the companies and the farmers that grow organic food and sell it to people. They put claims on the label. There is advertizing, there’s lots of information on websites. I think we all have a pretty good idea on how companies market products and deliver information to consumers. And in the United States, as you know, there is a number of laws and regulations that govern what is marketing hype and what’s not. Urvashi spoke to some of that. We’ve all heard the saying one aspirin a day helps prevent heart attacks. That’s kind of amazing that it does, but in large clinical trials, people that take an aspirin a day have a statistically significant lower risk of heart attack, and so the FTC and the FDA have allowed that claim on -- in advertising for aspirin. But if you heard an aspirin a day prevents heart attacks, that of course would be marketing hype. To claim that it will prevent goes over the line into marketing hype. So, how do we judge whether the claims that are made or the information that’s passed on by organic food companies crosses this line into misinformation or materially misleading information, which is a standard in the FTC guidelines? What the government says -- now, think about the last time you went to the supermarket. You can’t walk down any aisle without leading labels that say they havereduced this or low that or a good source of this or promotes heart health or promotes eye health or good for your cholesterol, heart healthy, etc. All of these claims that either promote a food product because there’s more of something that’s good or less of something that’s not good for you, like saturated fat or cholesterol or salt, embedded in those claims are at least a 25 percent difference in the level of the nutrient. This is applied fairly universally across the entire food system. So, whenever you see these labels that says it’s, you know, a good source of lycopene -- you’re buying a tomato product; lycopene is a nutrient in tomatoes -- and it says a good source of lycopene, you can trust that the company has done testing that shows that there’s at least 25 percent more in their product compared to others. So, as we go through the evening, keep in mind that if there is solid scientific evidence that one food product, whether it’s conventional or organic, has higher or lower of a particular nutrient that’s good or bad for you buy a Good or bad for you, by a 25% margin that the government allows a labeling claim to be associated with that. Now, how is organic food marketed? What are the principle claims? And benefits? Well, number one, of course, is organic farmers may not apply toxic synthetic pesticides. It's just a blanket prohibition. The products that they can apply encompass all of those hat post any risk to humans or the environment. It's true organic farmers request use natural products like copper fungicides, sulfur is used to help protect diseases. Natural insecticide, Bacilus thuringiensis that Blake talked about, it's how Monsanto and other biotech companies have found a way to move the capacity to produce this natural insecticide into the corn plants. And so without a doubt the reduction in exposure and risk from pesticides is the most common claim that you read. And there is no question that organic farming reduces pesticide risk. It's laughable for anybody to argue that it doesn't. You know, American agriculture, apply rounds, a billion pounds of pesticides a year. Some are not terribly hazardous, including Glyfosate which Blake will use on some of his genetically engineered crops. But there are several other pesticides, especially insecticides to do pose significant risk. And the fact that we're all exposed to pesticides, even before we're born, does play a role in our public health. Do you all know that the average baby born in America has like 200 chemicals in its blood the moment it’s born from the exposures to its mother? About one out of eight babies are born with a diagnosable birth defect? About a quarter of the couples in America are having trouble having babies. They need some help in getting pregnant  and carrying a pregnancy to term. The scientific literature is loaded with thousands of papers that demonstrate a connection between exposure to pesticides and these adverse health outcomes. To say that there are no risks for pesticides and no evidence, I mean if you don't -- if you don't believe in science, fine. Go ahead and make that statement. But you can't claim that you read the scientific literature. That -- you know, it's just the way it is. Another of the major claims that are made, and marketed, if you're shopping in the livestock part of the aisle, in the dairy or eggs or beef, livestock and organic farms have to be given ample space to carry out natural behaviors. They have to be raised in an environment where they can stay healthy without their daily dose of antibiotics, which Urvashi spoken out. They have to be given access to outside, unless it's 20 below and the weather would be dangerous for them. But they have to be raised in a much more humane way. That's built right into the rules; all organic farmers have to do it. If you care about how animals are cared for, if you care -- it's great that we can buy cheap bacon and eggs done cost much. If you do care how animals are cared for, organic agriculture with the only system of agriculture backed up by solid rules that require sound animal welfare: one of the reasons that we hope you'll vote against the motion."

    "data":"Thank you. Thank you very much. The proposition before us today, to me means prenatal genetic modification of human reproductive cells, like sperm or eggs or fertilized eggs, called the zygote, in preparation for gestation in the womb and development to full term infants should be prohibited at the societal level, and to this I agree firmly. The two basic reasons to carry out such an intervention: one, for curing or preventing genetic disease; or, two, for the enhancement of a person. For genetic diseases, in the great majority of cases there are simpler, less risky, less costly, less ethically controversial, and more dependable methods of preventing the birth of a child with a severe genetic abnormality by using prenatal embryo diagnosis; that is, for diagnosing the embryos. There are a couple of exceptions, which I think we will get to during this debate, such as mitochondrial disease. And we'll have more to say about that later. Other than the exception, the only sensible rationale for engaging in genetic modification of the fertilized egg is for the enhancement of a child. Enhancement might include intelligence, resistance to disease, greater height, muscle strength, appealing personality, longevity, any number of things you could imagine. Now, engaging in genetic modification of human gametes, the human reproductive cells, for enhancement is where I find the greatest moral failure and the greatest scientific folly. I offer three reasons: first, whatever enhancement is sought, the only method for determining whether it would work would be to engage in a clinical trial where you would have dozens of fertilized eggs or embryos, genetically modify half of them, carry them all to term, follow the development of the children throughout their lives to determine whether the intervention worked and at what expense to their health. No set of animal studies can ensure the safety and efficacy of human prenatal genetic modification. It is unimaginable that any humane, democratic society would permit such a trial with public or private funds; the risk would so outweigh the societal benefits. My distinguished colleague, professor Winston, will address some of the risks, complexities, and uncertainties with procedures using a genetic scalpel in the early embryo. Of course, the genetic modification of a single fertilized egg can be done outside of civil society, at some island community, where evidence of success, risks, and knowledge gained are of no concern. So that certainly can always happen. This takes us to the second reason that babies should not be genetically engineered for enhancement: from a biological and developmental standpoint, the so-called traits under consideration cannot remotely be enhanced by the modification of a gene or two. Traits like intelligence, personality, muscle tone, musicianship and -- are complex and not only involve dozens if not hundreds of genes but are the result of nutrition, social and environmental factors, genetic switches that are outside of the DNA and the gene-gene interactions that occur in human cells. Scientists and the so-called trans-humanists who believe that it is possible think of the human genome as a Lego set, where pieces of DNA can be plugged in or out without interfering with the other parts of the system. Actually, the human genome is more like an ecosystem where all the parts interrelate and are in mutual balance. Even for height, one of the most heritable traits known, scientists have found at least 50 genes that can account for only 2 to 3 percent of the variance of the samples. So there could be hundreds of genes associated with height. If you want a child, a tall child, marry tall. Finally, the idea of genetic enhancement grows out of a eugenic ideology that human perfection can be directed by genetics. The danger is not so much that it will work, but as a myth, it will have social power that can be used by those who have wealth and resources to make others believe that to be prenatally genetically modified makes you better.  It would be as much a myth as believing that the sperm of a Nobel laureate will give you a genius child. I am all for human enhancement, but it must start after an egg is fertilized, beginning in utero by protecting the fetus from toxic chemicals and continuing postnatally through environmental, nutritional and cognitive enhancement and moral education. Enhancement through genetic engineering of human germ plasm is a fool's paradise and will lead to no good. Thank you. "

    "data":"Good evening. I'd like to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation for airing this important debate, our moderate for John Donvan and my esteemed colleagues in this debate. I am here tonight to represent my personal views, and not the President's Commission on Bioethics of which I am a member, about why we should not prohibit genetically engineered babies. In a little while, you'll hear from my debate partner, Lee Silver, who will debunk many of the scientific claims against genetic engineering. But first I want to convince of you two things: that we already can and have safely genetically engineered babies and that a middle ground of prudent vigilance, public oversight and debate about genetic engineering is better than prohibition. I also want to call your attention to the resolution this evening. It calls for an outright and complete ban on genetic engineering of babies. If Lee and I can convince you of any instance in which genetic engineering of babies is legitimate, then you should vote against the resolution. Throughout the evening, I'll defend why genetic engineering is no different in kind from the many ways that we already engineer our children, from the partners we choose to prenatal screening to the supplements we take that impact our children and their fates. Recently new research shows the powerful effect of taking folate during pregnancy and how it reduces the incidence of autism in children. And yet no one thinks that we should ban folate. But I want to convince you that we already can and have taken the next step of genetic engineering of babies and that we would take a drastic step backwards to ban outright that technology. I'm going to tell you about inherited mitochondrial disorders, which are progressive and cause tragic health consequences. A little biology 101 should help frame the debate. About 98 percent of your DNA is nuclear DNA. It codes for much of who you are. But about 2 percent of your DNA is mitochondrial which supplies the energy to your cells. To understand this, visualize a cell with its small nucleus and a little bundle inside of the cell and the mitochondrial DNA and the fluid that surrounds it. The nucleus of the cell is where 99.9 percent of the action is, but only in the mitochondria functions properly. About one in 5,000 babies born have problems with their mitochondrial DNA that cause rare but incredibly serious disease, including heart failure, dementia, blindness, severe suffering and death. There is no way to treat the condition once it is acquired, and it is extremely difficult to predict how severely a child will be affected. With genetic engineering of babies, we can altogether avoid this suffering. Professors Winston and Krimsky will argue that we can just screen out and abort the defective fetuses or destroy the embryos in the lab. But mitochondrial DNA, which is solely inherited from the mother, is often passed on to every child of an afflicted mother. Only genetic engineering can safeguard a woman against these difficult choices and altogether eliminate the risk of a child being born with mitochondrial disease. Take, for example, Sharon, a woman who had a healthy pregnancy and who gave birth to a beautiful, healthy girl. Twenty-eight hours later, that baby died of an unknown disease. This tragic tale repeated itself five times as each of Sharon's babies lived for just a few hours. Only her son, Edward survived. And by age four, he started falling over repeatedly. He'll spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair with little control over his muscles. You see, Sharon has Lee's syndrome, a rare mitochondrial disease, and she passed it on to all six of her children. The only way that Sharon or any woman with a high level of mitochondrial abnormality will have her own healthy genetic children is through genetic engineering of the babies. We'll talk about two techniques to do so: Pronuclear transfer and maternal spindle transfer that safely eliminate the risk of these diseases. At least 30 children have already been born in the United States using an earlier version of mitochondrial transfer. All of these children were born free of mitochondrial disease. And these newer techniques have even fewer risks than those earlier ones and promise even better outcomes for future generations. The United Kingdom, notoriously conservative about reproductive technologies, has given the green light in the use of these technologies. A ban by the U.S. would make us an outlier, a country standing in the way of scientific progress, at odds with the scientific and ethical consensus that mitochondrial transfer, a form of genetic engineering of babies, is permissible. But mitochondrial genetic engineering proves my larger point that I want to convince you of this evening, that a middle ground approach is better than an outright ban. You'll hear my opponents talking about opening floodgates to a dystopia of designing perfect babies. But technology itself is not evil. Only misuse and misapplication of it is. The public can and should decide what limits if any there should be on the uses of genetic engineering. But a complete ban would just drive the practice into back alleys or overseas. Criminalizing genetic engineering will make the practice hidden from public view so that we will have no idea whether Sharon and women like her are using unsafe and unsavory practitioners to carry out genetic engineering. Reproductive tourism is already rampant, where women and couples are traveling to foreign countries to gain access to reproductive technologies banned in their own countries. You can be sure that women like Sharon, afflicted with terrible Lee's syndrome, will travel great distances to safeguard their children. Now imagine just for a moment how we would enforce the outright ban that the resolution calls for. Would we forcibly genetically test all babies? Would they -- would the government appear in Sharon's hospital room or at airports with handcuffs to arrest her or her child? Would we forcibly sterilize Sharon and her baby? Is this the kind of society that you want to live in? Some of the worst examples of abuses of government power in the last century have involved the government trying to control our reproduction. This grim history of eugenics and of laws against interracial marriage, of programs of forced sterilization and abortion, provide a strong reason to reject the resolution. We aren't here to defend every type of genetic engineering. We're here to urge you to vote in favor of a middle ground, to allow parents and private citizens to make private choices about one of the most intimate decisions they will ever make, to bring a healthy child into the world.

    "data":"Well, Ladies and gentlemen, it's great to hear my partner, Sheldon Krimsky, talking about the sperm of Nobel prizewinners. We've got Jim Watson in the audience, and it's And it's the 60th anniversary of your paper coming up, isn't it, on the DNA structure, which is a remarkable landmark. Ladies and gentlemen, this is actually quite a simple proposition. And it's quite clear that what our opponents are recommending is something which Americans shiver at, which is experimentation without the consent of the individual being experimented upon. It's worth looking very briefly at American history. The history of eugenics, which started probably in Britain, with Francis Galton back in the 1850s, is still a scar to some extent on genetics. And Davenport, of course, and other people who followed him, I think, had a great deal of responsibility for the sterilization of women without consent, with the prevention of people who might want to make love together because they were different races were prevented by law in many states in the United States. And this is something, of course, which directly influenced the Nazi holocaust. And although it may seem farfetched, it's worth bearing in mind that the time when the planet is oppressed by the risk of global warming, and by the risk of conflict, by the risk of all sorts of serious issues on the economy, it may well be that people might want to see eugenics raising its ugly head again. And the United States, in my view, as the leading biotechnological country in the world, has a major responsibility to lead it in this ethical issue. Now, as my partner has said, there are two concerns here. One is genetic engineering to change horrific genes such as these are mentioned, and the other, of course, is to enhance individuals. The problem, of course, is that once you go from one, I think you go to the other as well. And mitochondrial disease, let's just knock that on the head straightaway. Mitochondrial disease, although it's a terrible thing to have, it is really trivial in terms of its incidence. It's a very, very uncommon disorder. And it is worrying to me that our opponents have got the numbers wrong. It isn't 2 percent of the DNA, it's 16,000 base pairs out 3 billion base pairs. So it's a tiny amount of DNA, but we know already that even fiddling with the mitochondria may make a massive difference to what happens to the nuclear DNA. It's still not clear. And it's worth bearing in mind that abnormal children have been born as a result of mitochondrial transfer. This has been completely unpredictable. Now, with regard to one of the issues about genetic engineering for enhancement, it will be permanent, it will be irreversible, and it may impart values to a child that, that child might find is not valuable in the society in which they are growing up. And, of course, with regard to disease, it is quite clear that screening embryos is a much better bet. If we take a cell away or the look at the biochemistry of an embryo, which you can now do, and detect the disease, we can simply substitute that embryo for another one in a clutch of eggs because, of course, a woman -- it's worth bearing in mind that the average childbearing woman watching this program will lose two eggs during the course of the program, each genetically unique. The males, meanwhile, have made some 70,000 new sperm. Each of those are equally genetically unique, an every embryo is different. And therefore, to screen embryos which have a clear disease, by the techniques which are now being developed, is certainly possible and much safer than meddling with the genome. And, of course, what we have to understand is that we now know that the environmental influence on the embryo, the environmental influence on the fetus has a massive point, has a massive change, in how it grows up. And, in fact, really, what we should be trying to do -- rather than trying to risk making abnormal babies, what we should be trying to do is to improve the environment so that the DNA functions in the best possible way. There is a lot of evidence to show that a woman can change the cognitive ability, the intelligence of her fetus, by what she eats in pregnancy, what happens to her stress hormones in pregnancy, and this research is burgeoning. And that is something which we should really recognize in a democratic society as something that science should really concentrate on. Now, the big problem of course is that genetic engineering is unpredictable. And I'm going to give you two examples from the two biggest users of people who make genetically modified animals. The most common place for genetically modified animals, of course, is in the pharmaceutical industry. Pretty well every drug is now tested -- nearly every drug will be tested on animals, where their genes have been modified to make a model for human disease or to look at the action of that drug. And if you look at the figures which are being published by two of the largest companies in the world, with very large series of mass models, you can see the problem you'd have with genetic engineering. AstraZeneca published 51 different models, a vast number of mice in those models, 70 percent, ladies and gentlemen, of those animals were abnormal and the abnormality was unpredictable. Some of the abnormalities were trivial, others were not. The animals were not followed up for long term, they were simply discarded, so we don't know what would have happened to -- in old age. We do know that changing genetics makes a difference to what happens to us in our old age, and certainly the fetal origins of adult disease are very important. We know, for example, that stroke, diabetes, some cancers, may be caused by what happens in the environment of an embryo early on. And Pfizer has gone even further. It's looked at 74 different tests on mice that are bred after genetic modification, and 50 percent of the mice failed the phenotype test. And this is without, of course, testing the very things for which we would want to enhance people, i.e., intelligence and their ability to solve a problem. So let's just say one other thing, if I may, and that is that one of the problems, of course, is that one may modify genes, but we don't even know whether they will continue to function in the way. And there is a lot of evidence from the work we do in my own laboratory, which shows that gene expression in a modified animal stops after a while during development. Ladies and gentlemen, as I say, you have a responsibility here. You have a duty to lead the world to make certain that your medicine is ethical. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you. The proposition this evening is prohibit genetically engineered babies. Prohibit even if the purpose is to promote health; prohibit even if the recipients understand precisely the actual risk; prohibit even if it's safe; prohibit even if the technology is safer than doing nothing. I just need to convince you of one example of acceptability and you should vote to oppose the proposition. And my colleague has already talked very eloquently about mitochondrial DNA deficiency, and I'm going to go beyond that, because I hope to convince my opponents here to vote for my side of this proposition. They've both written and talked quite eloquently about the use of genetics to prevent disease. So what are we talking about here tonight when we talk about genetic engineering? Conceptually, it's very simple: genetic engineering will allow perspective parents to give their child genetic information that they themselves do not carry. That's how genetic engineering will first be used, not soon, but that's the way it's first going to be applied. And to understand what parents might want to give their children, we should examine the facts of genetics that have become available to us over the last five to ten years, have given us a very different perspective on the human genome than we had previously. And it revealed some unpleasant facts. I want you to look at the person sitting to the right of you. And if there's no one on the right, look at the person sitting to the left. That person and you differ at over a million locations in your DNA. Most of those differences don't do anything. But even if you're a healthy adult, at least 100 of those genetic variance can cause deadly childhood disease. Not in you, of course, because you're sitting in the audience. But in your grandchildren or their grandchildren. You carry thousands of other genetic variants, every one of you in this room, that impact your health and risk to thousands of diseases in different ways, including cancer and heart disease and neurological disease. And some of the variants that you carry are better than those of your neighbor to the right. Some are worse than those of your neighbor. And all in all, some of us are born with better health genes, and some are not. Now, if you have made a decision, you or a daughter, granddaughter, have made a decision to have a child, what do you hope for the most in that child? And Dr. Winston has spoken eloquently to this question many, many times. You hope for a healthy child. You'll love any child, but you hope for a healthy child. And Dr. Winston has also said, and I agree, in pluralistic societies like yours and mine, genetic selection against diseased embryos is a matter for the individuals concerned. If you agree with Dr. Winston on this point, it follows that you should be willing to accept genetic engineering when needed to accomplish the same goal. But, you might worry, doesn't this violate Mother Nature? Well, I'm here to tell you that Mother Nature doesn't care at all about you or your baby. Throughout the history of the human species, Mother Nature has engaged in all-out warfare against us with infectious diseases caused by viruses and bacteria. And it's only in the last century that we gained the knowledge and power to fight back with vaccines and antibiotics and other medicines. Now, do some people abuse pharmaceutical drugs? Of course there is abuse out there. But that doesn't mean that we should prohibit medicine. With infectious diseases essentially vanquished in our society, although not everywhere in the world, the next target in our sights is Mother Nature's genetic wrath. Unfortunately, if you're in the audience, it's too late to do anything about the genome and the hundreds of trillions of cells in your body. But we can think about the future. You can think about your children's children and their children's children, because the expansive amount of knowledge we are gaining about the genome has flabbergasted even those of us who are most optimistic about this science. So let's think about the next generation or the generation after that. Now, Mother Nature is a metaphor, and it's a really bad metaphor because in reality, inheritance is a game of craps. You throw the dice, you hold your breath, you hope your child is healthy. It won't have to be that way in the future when we learn how to take the genetic dice, place them on the table in the way that is going to promote health most likely for the child to be. What about the risks? We've heard about the risks from both of the proponents of this proposition, the precautionary principle is often mentioned. You shouldn't deploy a technology until all of the unknowable risks are known. And we can't possibly understand how genes work because the whole system of life is very complex. And if we put a new gene in, it might have unattended consequences. And I agree with the proponents of the proposition. We don't understand genetics. It's very complex, and it's more complex the more we understand it. But what society and people can do in the future is consider genetic information that already exists in some people but not others. I want to focus your mind on the fact, as I said a moment ago, we all carry thousands of genetic variants, some of which are promoting health and some of which are not. And even if a variant is in just 1 percent of the population out there, we can study the effects of that genetic variant in the people who carry that variant. And we can see the benefits or not of that variant. So the precautionary principle is not in effect here. I want to conclude that if you are thinking about voting for this proposition, you'll need to explain why you did so when your daughter or granddaughter comes to you with the following question: Dad, grandpa, why can't I give my child health-promoting, disease-preventing genes that other children get naturally? If you can't answer that question, you must vote no on this proposition. "

    "data":"As you hear from each of us tonight, I urge you to not only listen to our arguments, but consider our different backgrounds and our different interests. Since 2010, I've worked for the RAND Corporation. RAND is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization that's dedicated to objective analysis of some of the toughest policy questions confronting our country and the world. RAND analysts are expected to be dispassionate and detached. That's not a good way to win an Intelligence Squared debate. So this morning I advised RAND I was taking a day of annual leave. And I'm here tonight not as a RAND analyst but as an ER doctor. Who, as John said, worked for 25 years taking care of severely ill, injured, and dying patients in some of our nation's busiest ERs. The goal of emergency medicine is always to save lives. But you would be surprised how often we have to make decisions in consultation with patients and their families about whether or not initiating heroic measures is, in fact, the right thing to do and what the patient really wants. It happens when a critically ill patient is rushed to the ER in the very last stages of a terminal illness. And that usually happens when the patient's personal physician, well, they never got around to having the conversation. They never got around to talking with the patient about, What will they want us to do when they reach that point? So we end up having that conversation with the patient or with their loved ones at 2:00 in the morning in a family conference room or at the bedside. Now, from a medical or a business perspective, the easiest thing to do, by far, is just full-court press. Start resuscitation, incubate the patient, roll out the breathing machine, put in IV lines. But, you know, it doesn't always accomplish what we want. And rather than prolonging life, it simply prolongs the process of dying. That's why when Intelligence Squared called me and asked if I would do this debate tonight, my answer was an immediate yes, not only because of what the patient goes through, but what their family goes through too. Now, to clarify what we're debating tonight, I think it's important for us to define just what we mean. What kind of end-of-life care are we talking about? Medical and surgical treatments that do not achieve a reasonable goal of medicine should not be used. Limiting this type of care is not rationing; it's good medicine. Many treatments are used to achieve goals that patients did not want or were not proportionate to the burdens that the treatment imposed, because there was either ineffective communication about the disease prognosis, there is a failure to achieve adequate informed patient consent, or there was no advanced care planning. Avoiding these treatments is not rationing; it's simply rectifying poor-quality care. And some treatments are deserved, but they're extremely costly and have a very low chance of success. Declining to pay for such treatments is what most people would consider rationing. And my teammate, Professor Singer, will have more to say about that in a minute. But I do think there is one type of end-of-life care that is not used often enough. It's relatively inexpensive. It's highly valued by patients. And it's effective. It's palliative care. Palliative care is specialized care that's focused on relieving pain, relieving the burden of symptoms, helping the patient to be as comfortable and as functional as they can be as they approach the last days of their lives. Now, two years ago, a group of cancer specialists published an amazing study in the New England Journal of Medicine. They took a group of patients with a very serious type of lung cancer. And they randomly assigned them to two treatment groups. One treatment group got palliative care and standard cancer treatment. The other group got very aggressive, advanced cancer care. And they followed the two groups. The palliative care group not only had a better quality of life and less depression prior to their death. They lived longer than the group that got aggressive treatment. This past August another team followed nearly 400 cancer patients during their last months in life. Those that avoided hospitalization and avoided the intensive care unit were less worried. Those who prayed or meditated, those who were visited by their pastor in the hospital or in clinic, those who felt they had a strong bond with their doctors were happier, had higher quality of life and did better in the last days that they had on this earth. So at the outset of this debate, let's assume that our opponents did not come here to defend bad medicine. And you can be confident that Professor Singer and I did not come here to advocate limiting access to palliative care. So that leaves us with a pretty narrow set of situations in a highly charged question: Do patients in the last stages of terminal illness have an unqualified right to extremely costly treatments of uncertain value for as long as they want? Because if the answer is yes, the rest of us have to be prepared to pay the price. Despite remarkable progress of medical science, the global death rate is still 100 percent. So the question is not whether we're going to live or die. The question is where and how we'll die and who will be with us when we do. Most of us don't want to die in an intensive care unit strapped to a bed under fluorescent lights separated from our loved ones. Yet that's precisely what happens to too many of us because all too often our healthcare system is too focused on making money, too preoccupied with its technical prowess and too busy to sit down with a patient and have an honest, thoughtful, candid conversation about prognosis and the patient's wishes at the end of life. As a physician, my goals are simple: To save as many lives as I can, to ease pain and suffering when I cannot, and always, always treat my patients with compassion and respect. That's why at the end of this evening I urge you to vote for the proposition. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you, John. And I am against the proposition that we should ration end-of-life care. My mother was Canadian and a senior. In July of '05, she felt she had colon cancer. Her primary care doctor said she did not because he did an X-ray and no cancer showed up. Well, we all know that colon cancer is not detected by an X-ray but by a colonoscopy. But she could not get one in Canada because of her age and the fact that a waiting list for people under 65 with colon cancer symptoms was over six months. So by late November, my mother was hemorrhaging and had lost 35 pounds. She knew she was ill, and she went to the hospital in an ambulance and went to the emergency room, spent two days in the transit lounge. Then she did get her colonoscopy. But sadly, she passed away two weeks later from metastasized colon cancer. This is the outcome when government bureaucrats set the rules for who is going to get care and when. This is rationed care and what will face seniors in America if the Affordable Care Act is not repealed and replaced. Rationing care at the end of life may be a sound solution in the abstract. But when it comes to your mother, your father or your child who has a terminal illness, it is wrong for social engineers and government bureaucrats to make these life decisions for you. In Canada where I grew up, the government spends 11.4 percent of gross domestic product on healthcare. And private health insurance is outlawed. The government sets a global budget, the one that government can afford. The demand for healthcare is much greater than the supply. As a result, Canadians spend -- and they have long waiting lists, rationed care and lack of access to the latest treatments. 17 percent of Canadians are waiting to get a primary care doctor. In 2011, 940,000 Canadians were on a waiting list waiting for treatment. The average wait in 2011 from seeing a primary care doctor to getting treatment by a specialist was 19 weeks, up from 18.2 weeks the year before. In the case of my own mother, it may have shortened her life, but it was definitely cheaper for the government. In the case of my mother, it may have shortened her life. But colon cancer is one of the most common diseases among our seniors. A study published in the British journal Lancet Oncology, suggests that America is one of the best countries for treating cancer and survival rates five years after diagnosis for 13 of the 16 most common cancers. Do we want to change this outcome by controlling healthcare costs through rationed care? For example breast cancer survival rates among American women is 83.5 percent, whereas in Britain, it's only 70 percent. Prostate cancer, survival rate 92 percent in the U.S., only 51 percent in Britain. So how will the Affordable Care Act ration care for our seniors and in particular those in need of healthcare? In three ways: The Independent Payment Advisory Board, accountable care organizations and the patient-centered Outcome Research Institute. First, IPAB; on October 1, President Obama and Governor Romney spent a lot of time debating the issue of IPAB. IPAB will be a panel of 15 unelected members appointed by the president and approved by the Senate whose job it is to cut Medicare spending. It will go into effect when federal spending by doctors and hospitals on Medicare exceeds the average Consumer Price Index growth rate between 2014 and 2018. After that, costs will be tied to GDP growth plus 1 percent. The board must propose spending cuts. Congress could overrule the board, but only if it has a 3/5 majority in the Senate and the House or comes up with another plan to reduce costs. The accountable care organization is second. They are delivery models for doctors and hospitals to give them financial incentives to provide good quality coordinated care to Medicare beneficiaries while keeping costs down. They would benefit by sharing in savings with the government if costs are lower than projected for treating Medicare patients. If higher, ACOs would have to pay back funds to the government. It is my belief that doctors and hospitals will ration or deny care to seniors if they feel that their costs would exceed the ceiling. ACOs are a giant HMO. Third is the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). It is similar to NICE in the UK, a government agency that determines which treatments are cost effective as compared to medically effective. While no one can deny that there are problems in American healthcare, a system that empowers doctors and patients will solve them, not the federal government. I do think that everyone here would agree we all want affordable, acceptable quality care. How do we achieve that goal? Well, I believe there are two competing visions when it comes to healthcare reform and achieving universal coverage. One focuses on doctors and patient-centered solutions. The other focuses on increasing the role of government in our healthcare system. That was President Obama's vision. Liberal politicians, academics and the elite media tell Americans that socialized assistance such as exists in Canada and Europe are better and cheaper and can provide universal coverage for all. And while it is true that 5 percent or 2.5 million seniors in their last year of life consume 25 percent of Medicare spending, it is still my belief it is not the government's place to limit costs by sacrificing lives. End-of-life decisions should be made by doctors and families, not bureaucrats such as those on IPAB and PCORI. They will ration the care our seniors receive, and I believe that is ethically and morally wrong. In my view, people have every right to live as long as they can. Therefore, I urge you to vote against the proposition. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you very much. It's the position of our side that we are already rationing health care, so in a sense we can't really debate whether we should do so. The question that we can discuss is whether we should be open and explicit about what we're doing, and, therefore, try to do it in the best, most thought-out way possible, which essentially means, Do it in the way that gets the best value for the health dollars that we're spending now, or whether we should continue to do it in a way that we don't bring out in the open so we cover up, that we don't really dare to discuss. And we can see that politically it's not really a topic that people dare to discuss openly, and as a result, more people will die who could be saved than will die if we use the money we're spending effectively. Now, it's clear that we are not spending our health dollars effectively in this country at present. We spend about between 17 to 18 percent of everything we have, of our gross national product, on health care. That's about 50 percent more than other comparable countries, the other industrialized countries that we compare ourselves with. There is no evidence, no evidence that we get any better outcomes for the extra 50 percent that we're spending, the extra 7 or 8 percent of GDP that we're spending, than those other countries. And Dr. Kellermann will give you a more detailed rebuttal to what Sally Pipes just said when she specifically focused on cancer in those remarks. When we looked at not just what the health system does – but at health outcomes in America, we're actually terrible. It's the combination of what the health system does and our general health. We rank in terms of health outcomes somewhere around the level of countries like Slovenia and Costa Rica. They are countries that are much poorer than we are, and yet their health outcomes are comparable to ours. And the other industrialized nations have better health outcomes, including, incidentally, Canada. It's also true -- it's also true that when you ask Canadians, as Gallop did a couple of years ago, and Americans, and Britons, people in the U.K., do they have confidence in their health care system, the Britons and the Canadians, 73 percent of them, just coincidentally the same number, say, Yes, they do. When you asked Americans, only 56 percent of them say they do. I think that there's a general feeling that this health care system is not delivering what we want. But as I said it is rationing. It rations in many ways. For example, we about 44 million people, Americans, now, who are not insured at all. That number will drop significantly when Obama Care comes into effect, but it will not unfortunately drop to zero. Now, not being insured means that you are more likely to die if you have a serious illness or accident. In fact, Joseph Doyle, a MIT scientist, looked at people who were brought into emergency care as a result of road accidents, seriously injured. And found that those who were uninsured died at a higher rate even when adjusting for other variables than those who had insurance. And when he calculated how much it would have cost to save these people's lives, it would have been about $280,000. Reasonable amount of money. But that was how much more was spent on saving the lives of the others. But given that these were mostly fairly young people, in terms of how much it would have cost to extend their lives for one year, it would be about $5,500. These people's lives were lost because we were not prepared $5,500 for each year of life that we could have saved. Compare that with the amount that those much criticized bodies Sally Pipes mentioned NICE, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom. What they say is too much to spend. Apparently, NICE’s figure is around $49,000. In other words, almost 10 times, nine times as much as would have saved the lives of these young accident victims. And of course, we ration in a lot of other ways as well, because some people can't afford copayments. We have long waiting times. We don't pay doctors enough for Medicare, and so they don't take Medicare patients, or they don't take so many Medicare patients. So we are losing lives, and we're losing lives that we could save quite cheaply. So I think we ought to be more explicit about this. We ought to be prepared to say, Let's use the dollars -- maybe we should spend more dollars. I'm not necessarily opposed to spending more dollars. But let's use the dollars we spend in the most effective way in order to save the greatest number of lives. Something has to be done, because health care costs are rising here much faster than the economy is growing. They're rising at 9.8 percent per annum. We all know the economy is not growing at anything like that amount. So as that keeps happening, what's going to happen? It will eventually soak up all available spending. But we know the government has to spend on other things. On the [Intelligence Squared] website, in the articles that were posted. There's a very moving piece by Ken Connor about the plight of elderly citizens in our country, how they are neglected, and how because of the demographic changes, there's going to be more of them. Effectively, we need to spend a lot more to give our senior citizens a comfortable and dignified life when they can no longer look after themselves. That costs money, and it's going to cost more money. We cannot increase health care spending indefinitely and also spend more on the elderly and spend more on the environment, on education, on all of the other important things that we need. So, like it nor not, we are rationing health care. We are arguing that, indeed, we should. That's obvious. But whether we should be more explicit about it, because we want to get the best results we can. We want to save the most number of lives that we can. And the way to do that is to be explicit and vote yes for this motion. We should be rationing health care. Thank you.  "

    "data":"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Sally Pipes' mother's situation is exhibit A for why Americans don't want the government to wind up rationing health care in this country. By contrast, my mom suffered from advanced colon cancer late in life at an older age than Sally's mom. She received aggressive treatment, both surgery and chemotherapy, made a full recovery, and went on to live more than a decade of a good and healthy life, until she finally died at 90 at home in good health in her own bed. Which system would you prefer? Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to make three points, if I may, about why government should not be in the business of rationing health care. First of all, health care decisions should be made at the end of life, just as at any other point in life, at the bedside, by the people involved and who are affected, not by bureaucrats at a remote location. Secondly, that rationing is unethical, because it ultimately devalues human life and inevitably winds up punishing the sick and the dying. Thirdly rationing is the lazy man's way -- lazy man's attempt to balance the budget. It's easier to balance the budget on the backs of the sick and dying than it is to reform your ways of wasteful spending in government and try to wrench money back from the hands of the special interests at home and abroad. So back to the premises, first of all, that healthcare decisions should be made at the bedside. Americans don't want bureaucratic bean counters in Washington making decisions about what kind of care they're going to wind up receiving at the end of life. Decisions about healthcare and how it ought to be administered and when it ought to be administered ought to be decisions that are made by the patient informed by their doctors and by their families. Decisions about what kind of care will be administered at any given time to any given patient should take into account the needs of the patient. In other words, healthcare should be both individualized and particularized to the needs of the given patient. A bureaucrat remote from the bedside, hundreds, perhaps thousands of miles away practicing assembly line medicine simply is not in a position to make those kinds of individualized decisions that are required. These are decisions that have to be based real time, sometimes at 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. in the morning as Dr. Kellermann has pointed out. And it's the people who have their feet on their floor -- on the floor in the hospital and their hands on the patient who ought to be making these decisions. There's simply no way that a government functionary practicing assembly line medicine in Washington can make those kinds of decisions. Healthcare requires the fine edge of a scalpel, not the blunt end of an ax. And patients don't want their doctors straight-jacketed by some bureaucratic straightjacket fashioned in the federal city. They want decisions made by doctors who are taking their interests into account. They don't some interest that was decided in a smoke-filled room in Washington, in a room that was predominated by lobbyists to be the ones who are making the decisions. And, folks, do we really want the men who are wearing the green eye shades in Washington to be making these kinds of decisions? Should cost be the primary driver of such decision, especially in the zero sum environment that prevails in Washington? I would submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that when the tradeoffs are made, we don't want decisions about healthcare to go by the board in preference to a new start in green energy or some other pie in the sky kind of effort. Now, no one is suggesting for a moment that we should not be good stewards of scarce healthcare resources. We absolutely should be. But rationing is not what we need. It's rational care. We ought to be asking ourselves, is the procedure under consideration necessary for the patient? Is it clinically appropriate? Is the cost reasonable compared to similar services? These are questions that ought to be answered by people with their feet on the ground in the hospital in real time by hospitalization -- hospital utilization committees and not by people who are removed from the bedside. Now, folks, make no mistake about it, government rationing represents the first step down the road to the utilitarian philosophy of former Colorado governor Richard Lamb who said, The elderly have a duty to die and get out of the way. This philosophy sees the elderly and the handicapped as resource hogs whose useful life is over and who now costs more to maintain than they produce. They reject the sanctity of life ethics that has long prevailed in this country, and that maintains that every human life is precious and out to be respected and protected under the law. That view affirms equal protection for all, the old, and the handicapped to the very young and to the very old. Instead the quality of life advocates maintain that we should use quality of life calculus and functional capacity studies in deciding who lives and who dies.  Of course, the elderly and the handicapped who suffer from dementia and disability don't score well using those formulas. And isn't that the point? Ladies and gentlemen, what criteria will the all-wise bureaucrats use to pick winners and losers at the end of life? Will they be any more successful than they were in picking Solindra and Bright Source and Abound Solar on whom the government squandered billions of dollars? But then again, what does it matter? At the end of life, we're all going to die, right? Folks, I would suggest to you that there are many places that we can look to find the savings that we need to provide appropriate care for the sick and for the dying. For heaven's sakes, we spent $4 trillion on the Wall Street bailout to rescue businesses that engaged in profligate spending practices. Surely, we can spend the money required to render appropriate healthcare to the sick and the dying. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote against the proposition because by the time you reach the end of your life, you'll be glad you did. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you very much, John. And thank you to the audience. You play a key role here tonight. I want to thank Intelligence Squared for sponsoring this debate. And I want to recognize my opponents, one of whom has written more than anybody else in the world on this topic. And most of all, I want to thank my debate partner, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former CBO director and a senior policy advisor to Senator John McCain. My partner, Douglas Holtz-Eakin is a numbers guy, and he will focus on the numbers. And I believe he will be able to clearly show you that Obamacare both won't work and perhaps more importantly, will put a critical strain on our nation's fiscal stability. Let me begin, however, by refuting two arguments. First, supporters of Obamacare will say that Republicans simply don't believe in healthcare and indeed that they favor the status quo. That is simply wrong. I believe in my tenure in Congress I had written more healthcare reform bills than any other member of Congress. I wrote a number of patients rights bills in the early debate. But I was also joined throughout this with the help of Paul Ryan and Tom Coburn and Jim DeMint and Richard Burr and Dr. Tom Price and Dr. Burgess and on and on. And you would find countless proposals by Republicans to reform our nation's healthcare. Second, supporters of Obamacare will tell you that it will actually save the government money. And they will tell you that repealing it will cost the government money. Now, Douglas Holtz-Eakin will demonstrate with the numbers that those claims are unfounded. But I urge you to begin by just looking at this question with common sense. Obamacare insures roughly 32 million additional Americans, most through Medicaid. That will increase costs. It creates a massive new bureaucracy, some 150 plus agencies and bureaus. That's got to increase costs. And it extends dramatic new mandates over health insurance in America. And that will increase costs. Now, let me move on to one point that I think is very important to understand. The current system is in fact broken. As I said, I have written numerous bills to try to fix it. Costs are way too high, and they're going up too quickly. There are too many uninsured and too many Americans have pre-existing conditions and cannot get affordable coverage. I have a pre-existing condition, and I have an older sister who has -- who is a breast cancer survivor, probably the worst kind of pre-existing condition. One aspect of the current system is in fact indefensible. It's the provision that says your employee-provided care is tax free. It costs them no taxes and you no taxes. But it punishes those without employee-provided care. Indeed, it tells them, we want you to get insurance so much we're going to force you to pay for it with after-tax dollars, making it a third more expensive. That is simply outrageous and indefensible. And stunningly,Obamacare does not fix that problem. Obamacare is simply the wrong answer. First, it addresses symptoms, namely the uninsured, which are too high. But it does not address, I do not believe appropriately, certainly not with incentives, cost. Second, it will not only increase the cost to the government, but it will drive up your premiums. And the experts agree on that point. It moves -- and perhaps this is most important--healthcare decision making away from employers and the insurance companies they hire, and they're making lousy decisions, and they shouldn't be deciding. But it doesn't give those decisions to you and me. It gives them to the government. What we need to do is take decision making away from employers and insurance companies and give it to people. Give it to patients, individuals and their families, and let them consult with their doctor and make those decisions. Republican proposals in Congress do exactly that. Why? Because if the health insurance is yours, not your employer's and not the government's, it's personal, and it belongs to you. You can make the changes. You aren't trapped in a plan your employer picked. You can force the insurance companies to compete, which they don't do now. You can hire the plan of your choice. And because it's yours, you can fire it, meaning you can hold it accountable to you. Briefly, let me touch on why Obamacare will drive costs up. By its terms, Obamacare institutes lots of mandates. One is guaranteed issue, meaning nobody can be turned down. That will increase cost. One is modified community rating. That will increase costs. And a third is an array of new benefit mandates. All of those will increase costs. Indeed, in every state, with guaranteed issue and community rating, and in every state where they mandated more and more benefits, costs have gone up dramatically. In Massachusetts, after adopting a plan very similar to Obamacare, costs have continued to go up at a rate faster than the national average. Let me touch on some of Obamacare's broken promises. The president told us over and over, and quite frankly, over again, that if you like your plan, you can keep it. Not true. He said if you like your doctor, you can keep it. You can keep him or her. Not true. And he said that Obamacare would send the cost curve down. None of those promises, as we examine the plan, turn out to be true. The Medicare actuary has already estimated that some 14 million people will lose their current coverage. Leading experts say few plans will actually survive. How could they survive? They have to meet benefit mandates that haven't even yet been written. In fact, thousands of Americans will lose their employer-provided healthcare because their small employer or large employer cannot afford to continue to offer it. They will lose their healthcare. AT&T, a study was done and provided to the commerce committee that showed AT&T will save $2 billion, $2 billion if they cancel their employees' care and pay the fine.  John Deere will lose $150 million a year. Caterpillar, $100 million a year. 3M, $90 million a year. The numbers go on and on. Those employers will have no choice to their stockholders but to drop that care. They'll be forced. And think about their workers. Their workers will lose their current plan, and they'll lose their doctor. We simply have to do better than that. The new, indeed, one provision of the law is outrageously unfair, as unfair as the tax code is now. It provides, in the new healthcare exchanges, that if you are uninsured, or if you buy in the individual market, you can enjoin the exchange. And if you join the exchange, you can get a government subsidy. But if you have employer-provided care, you cannot join the exchange. That simply isn't fair because it means the cost of your care is subsidized, some with the exact same income cannot get subsidized care. "

    "data":"We should uphold the Affordable Care Act because it is morally the right thing to do and it is in our common interest. And when I first began work on the healthcare back in the 1970s, the official number for the uninsured was 26 million, 12 percent of the population. By the early '90s, it was up to 37 million. Now it's reached 50 million. And if we were to do the kinds of things that the Congressman has advocated, the number will go higher. Fifty million, that's already a lot of people for whom illness is devastating, who may lose everything they have because of illness. For years surveys have shown that anxiety about not being able to pay for the healthcare you need ranks at the top of Americans' anxieties. And Americans are more likely -- much more likely than people in the other rich democracies to put off getting medical care for fear of the cost. Still, the majority of Americans, and I guess most of the people here tonight, do have insurance, and it's tricky to figure out how to help the millions who get a raw deal while protecting the interests of those who already have protection. The Affordable Care Act is an intelligently crafted effort to do that. It extends coverage in two ways, by expanding Medicaid for poor people who've been cut out of that program, and by creating insurance exchanges where other people can easily and efficiently buy a private insurance plan under a new set of rules that, for example, prevent insurers from excluding preexisting conditions, and where subsidies are available to keep the premium for a medium leveled package at no more than eight percent of income. Now, the insurance exchange is not just a hypothetical concept. Massachusetts has a working exchange, The Health Connector, adopted as part of the reforms introduced by Governor Mitt Romney and passed overwhelmingly by both parties. If you move to Massachusetts, you can use The Connector's website and, in half an hour, sign up for an insurance plan, no broker's fees, no hassle. No wonder brokers don’t like the idea of the insurance exchange but we don’t kill off Expedia or Travelocity for the sake of the travel agents, do we? And currently, if you buy coverage individually or through a small business, and if we all bought coverage individually the way the Congressman wants, 30 cents or more out of every premium dollar gets sucked up in administrative and marketing costs. The exchanges are just one way the reform squeezes out costs from the system. In regard to coverage, the Affordable Care Act is modeled on the Massachusetts reforms. It does a lot more on cost containment, and far from being a government takeover, the program aims to create a better functioning market for private insurance. The origins of this idea go back to old Republicans -- Republican proposals, to a plan that Richard Nixon proposed in 1974, and to a bill introduced by Senator John Chafee, with 20 Republican cosponsors, back in 1981 -- 1991, a bill by the way that had an individual mandate in it. And substantively, the Affordable Care Act is bipartisan legislation. We just don’t happen to live in a bipartisan political era. Consider the law's moderate responsible approach to financing. The basic idea is to find most of the money to expand coverage from within the healthcare system. We spend enough on healthcare, we just don’t allocate it well. Healthcare providers and insurers will get more than 30 million new paying customers, and since the law's purpose is not to provide them with windfall profits, it claws back some of the revenue, for example, by reducing the future growth in Medicare payments, and by cutting excessive payments to private Medicare plans. The law also imposes a tax on high cost health plans that really should bring a smile to Douglas Holtz-Eakin because he defended a proposal that was functionally identical when he was John McCain’s Health Policy Advisor. Our Republican friends will tell you that this legislation will explode the deficit, even though the CBO tells us it will reduce the deficit. Now, Jon is my partner in this. Jon Cohn is going to talk more about cost. But while you're listening to the other side, please bear in mind that when Bill Clinton left office we were looking at a $3.1 trillion surplus back then. And Bush came in, cut taxes, passed a Medicare prescription drug benefit with no financing, sent us to war in Iraq without taxes to pay for it and, of course, the deficit exploded. It exploded on their watch leaving us in the end with a financial crisis and the great recession. What happened to health care costs in that period, in the years between 2001 and 2006 when Republicans had control of both the White House and Congress? What did they do about health care costs? Here are the facts. Family health insurance premiums went up 87 percent compared to 20 percent increase in general inflation and a decline of three percent in real median household income. Faced with a potential death spiral in the individual and small group markets, many of the interest groups that opposed healthcare reform in the past, the American Medical Association, the hospitals, the for-profit hospitals, too, even many of the insurers decided that the current situation had to be changed. And that’s why we got legislation in 2010 and not just because of the Democrats but because so many in healthcare saw it was wrong and worked to make it -- to change it. Now just a word on Mr. Shadegg’s proposals. We have low-regulation states, states that don’t regulate the insurance industry. His own state of Arizona is one of those states and their costs are just as high as elsewhere. Arizona has 20 percent uninsured. The high deductible insurance policies combined with tax-advantage savings accounts that he and other Republicans favor and put into law haven’t shown any sign of reducing costs or extending coverage. They are, however, a great tax shelter and in fact if you’re in a high tax bracket, it’s great to have a health savings account. You can put money in the account, don’t even use it for healthcare and withdraw it after age 65 without penalty. So those are proposals that are great for people who are healthy and well-off. They just don’t happen to do much for the low-income workers and the others who really face the difficulties in paying for healthcare. "

    "data":"So thank you very much for the chance to be here tonight to our sponsors and to our opponents. You know, I’m going to ask you to support the motion but in the end, you’ve all realized that what we’re debating tonight is about getting healthcare reform in the United States because there is no dispute about the need for healthcare reform. My own history, John’s history, probably the histories on the other side of the table of which I’m unaware are stark tribute to the need to do things better in the United States. Real healthcare reform has two pieces. Number one, it extends healthcare coverage to Americans, gives them options for insurance and insurance is a product which shifts around the cost of your healthcare. In the end, an insurance system takes the nation’s health care bill and shifts around who picks up the ultimate cost, moving it from some people who are unable to shoulder the full burden of the cost of their care to some others who may be able to. The second piece, the piece that drives everything, is the overall healthcare bill. And the United States has a health care bill which is far too large and certainly far too large for what we get. At one-sixth of our economy, it’s one of the most inefficient pieces of economics that one could imagine. And the key fact to remember in thinking about this debate is that over the past four decades. If you look at income per person in the United States and healthcare spending per person, the resources versus the costs, costs have been winning at two to two and a half percentage points every year for four decades. Republicans, Democrats alike. It is the costs and the spending on healthcare that ultimately has to be covered by insurance premiums. And if you don't control costs, you cannot control insurance premiums, and you cannot deal with extending coverage to Americans, which is ultimately what real healthcare reform is about. I favor repeal because this reform flunks the test of healthcare reform. It does not deal with the cost problem. Now, I don't need to say so. Many people, far more qualified than I, have said so. The Congressional Budget Office, in the aftermath of passage of the Affordable Care Act, put out its new long-term care -- or its new long-term budget projections. Did health spending in the federal budget grow more slowly as a result of this? No, it does not. You can look at the CMS actuary, the administration, the Obama administration's own chief actuary, Richard Foster, who estimates that the affordable care actually will raise national healthcare spending, not lower it, and will actually endanger the future of Medicare, not make it more solid. You can ask Jonathan Gruber. Jonathan Gruber is one of the architects of Obamacare. He's one of the architects of the Massachusetts reform on which Obamacare was founded. And in his article in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, he says, “This isn't about cost reform. This is health insurance reform. There's nothing in it. Much like Massachusetts, it's just about covering people. It doesn't control costs.” And you can look at the experience in Massachusetts where, prior to reform, Massachusetts had costs that were 25 percent higher than the national average. And after reform, they were at 30 percent higher than the national average, no improvement in the fundamental requirement of healthcare reform. So we need to get the healthcare reform. And without that, we will never control the budgetary costs that threaten our nation. Now, I'm a former CBO director. It is my obligation to stand up in public and say apocalyptic things about the budgetary future. I'll spare you the numbers tonight because I like you more than my children. But the bottom line is this nation, looking forward -- forget re-litigating the past. Mr. Starr is good at that. But looking forward in the administration’s budget 10 years from now, after the financial crisis is in memory, after we’re soon to be out of Iraq, out of Iran, after the economy is [unintelligible] back at five percent unemployment, we are running a deficit of a trillion dollars. Nine hundred billion of it's to pay interest on previous borrowing. We are headed to that magical position where we're borrowing to pay previous borrowing and nothing else. Along the road, we will pass the criteria for downgrade as a sovereign nation. We will no longer be a top-rated borrower. This act makes that situation worse, not better. It says that two new open-ended entitlement programs that will grow, according to CBO, at eight percent a year, as far as the eye can see, the economy is not going to grow at eight percent. Revenue's not going to grow at eight percent.  The only way you could make that kind of a move add up budgetarily is smoke, mirrors and gimmicks. And that's what the Affordable Care Act is riddled with, in which the CBO was forced to acknowledge in its score. If you give them handcuffs, they'll come up with any answer that you might want. So we can't afford this as a nation. It is dangerous because it doesn't control costs. It's not really healthcare reform. You need to vote for healthcare reform, not Obamacare. One sixth of our economy is underperforming. If we care about economic performance, we should repeal Obamacare. Forget the mandates, forget the taxes. We had a system that was broken to begin with. One-sixth of our economy is broken. Why not fix it instead of writing checks and papering over it? But you hear some other arguments from the other side, the popular ones, now, the issues of fairness. Let us stipulate this is one of the most unfair pieces of legislation ever passed. There are the inequities between two people similarly situated, making $70,000. One's going to get $7,000 in federal subsidies, 10 percent of their income. The other's going to get zip. That is grotesquely unfair. And if any future Congress acts [unintelligible] pass one, it'll get solved in a nanosecond. They'll give everybody the money. And my first problem will blow up even worse. Terrible idea. And for every young person in this audience, this is a disaster. Through the individual mandate you'll be obligated to be in the pool. The purpose is to put you in there to pay the healthcare bills of people who are older and sicker than you. And at the end of your life, you get to pick up the debt that's been incurred through Obamacare. You'll get it at the front end. You'll get it at the back end. It is one of the most inter-generationally unfair things that has ever been scripted by the United States Congress. Should be repealed on those grounds alone. There are other sort of detours along the way. The insurance companies, that's where all the costs come from. Oh, my God, there are administrative costs. There are profits. The top 10 insurance companies in 2009 made $260 billion. That's a lot of money. I'd like to have it. The cost growth problem every year is $175 billion. So go for it. Nationalize the insurance companies, confiscate their profits. You get about a year and a half's worth of relief, and we're right back where we were. This isn't about insurance companies. This is about fundamental changes to the delivery system so that we coordinate care so that we deliver high quality care at lower costs. And the greatest missed opportunity here was the chance to fix Medicare, which is at the root of our problems. Medicare pays doctors. It pays hospitals. It pays some insurance companies, and it pays drug companies. And it has silos to pay them all. And nowhere in there can you find a beneficiary. Nowhere in there can you get coordination of care. Nowhere in there is the kind of healthcare Americans deserve. We should fix that first. We should repeal this now. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you. I want to thank the audience. I want to thank the foundation. I want to thank my opponents. I want to thank Doug Holtz-Eakin in particular for some of the comments he just made about the dire fiscal straits of the country, the importance of trying to get healthcare costs under control because if we don't get healthcare costs under control, we're not only going to bankrupt our government, we're going to bankrupt our entire society. And you know, I agree with all of that. I do. Where we differ you may -- as you may imagine, is that I happen to think the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, helps us in that regard. Now, you listened to this team over here. You've listened to their argument. And they painted a very dire picture of a program out of control that's going to cost more than anybody thinks. It's going to leave us all paying tons in insurance premiums. And you know, they have to paint an apocalyptic picture because I think the honest truth is most of us, when we hear that -- about the benefits of the plan, that we'll be able to guarantee coverage for people who have pre-existing conditions, the right to appeal treatments when their insurance company turns it down, subsidies for people who can't buy coverage now. People like that. They think that is a good idea. So they focus on this cost question. And, you know, during the healthcare debate, we had all this scare talk about death panels and other things that just were simply not in the [unintelligible] -- with all due respect to my -- to our debating opponents here who I know have spent a lot of time talking about it, I think they're giving you, well, I don't want so say they're making things up out of whole costs [spelled phonetically], but I think they're giving you a slightly, let's say, one-sided picture of things. So I did two things here. First, I want to explain why I have faith that the Obama healthcare bill will in fact reduce costs. And I want to specifically go through some of the arguments they have made and tell you why they are misleading. Now, why do I have faith that this healthcare bill will save money? I mean isn't -- Congressman Shadegg said, isn't it common sense that it won't? I don't think it's common sense. I look around the world. I look at countries like France and Germany and Switzerland and Japan, countries that get just as good healthcare as we do or better, people who have easier access to healthcare, and yet they spend less than we do. Now, is there something about the United States that we're not capable? We're not innovative enough? We can't do that? I don't think so. Certainly it is possible, certainly, to get excellent healthcare, cover everybody and save money. So the question is, will this bill do it? And I believe it will. Let me take a second to explain how the bill is designed to do that. It has three basic approaches. One is to get the low-hanging fruit of healthcare, the waste. A lot of it's corporate welfare. Right now, for example, insurance companies that provide benefits through Medicare, study after study has shown that we pay them too much. They're making too much in profits. So we say we're going to take some of that back. We're going to take back that corporate welfare. Another source of offsetting revenue for the healthcare program is to go and ask people who have benefited the most from our economy, the people who are the very wealthiest in our society, to pay back a little more in taxes. And we get money from there. Now, I don't think either of those propositions are in dispute in terms of that those things will generate money to offset the costs of the healthcare plan. Now, they may not like those ideas. And that's fine. And maybe in the question and answer period they can tell us why they think we need to keep giving insurance companies corporate welfare. Why the richest people in this country, who are enjoying far lower tax rates than they had during the Clinton administration, can't afford to pay a little more. But it's the third part of healthcare reform, the third part of cost control that's the most important. And this is where we really look at the way the American medical care system works. Everybody who is -- every expert left and right says we waste a ton of money in our medical care system. Some of this is administrative waste because everyone's dealing with 10 different insurance companies. Some of this is duplicative treatments because Dr. A doesn't know what Dr. B is doing to patient C. Some of this is the fact that we pay tons of money for treatments that don't work. The Obama healthcare bill, what it does is it tries to attack those, and it tries dozens of different approaches, and it's not a liberal takeover, it is not something crazy extremists cooked up on one side, it's actually the best ideas of the left and the right. It's ideas like not paying hospitals if they run high rates of in-hospital infection. It's things like developing electronic medical records so we can keep track of what patients are getting as they move through the medical system. It's about giving financial incentives to doctors and hospitals that coordinate care and focus on prevention, and efforts like this that together, the smartest people have stated this, all believe will help control healthcare costs. Now, Douglas Holtz-Eakin got up here and said these numbers are crazy, that of course this is going to explode the deficit, and again, common sense, well, the most reliable authority we have on this is the Congressional Budget Office. Congressional Budget Office is the gold standard of accounting. The CBO -- my reading of the CBO report is that they looked at the healthcare bill and they said, You know what? This bill will reduce the deficit. It will reduce the deficit in the first 10 years, it will reduce it by a lot more afterwards. And by the way, the rate of growth in healthcare spending is going to start to slow down. Now, it is true that the CBO, you can say, Well, the CBO ought to use these rules, or whatever. Well, what the CBO rules mean is that we are assuming that the laws that we have passed are going to be implemented, and that is the way -- and that is the way the government accounting system works. Douglas Holtz-Eakin says, Well, that never works because we've never seen it happen. Well, you know what? It's happened before. During the late 1990s we tried to control costs in Medicare and we did for a while. We passed very large cuts to Medicare during the Balanced Budget Act. It was the late 1990s, and you know what? Those cuts stuck, and we were able to reduce the growth of Medicare from where it would’ve been otherwise. It’s entirely possible to do this. Now, in order to do this you have to actually stick with a program. As my colleague mentioned, during the Bush administration they passed a different -- they tried to approach healthcare in a different way. They said, “All right, let’s try a different approach, and let’s have a healthcare bill, let's not pay the cost for it.” Well, that did increase the deficit, and that is the sort of choice we’re talking about facing here. Now, my colleague -- my opponent, Mr. Holtz-Eakin, cited a number of authorities he believed, and he said, “Well, John Gruber of MIT says this is not good,” or he said, “The CMS actuary said this. Well, in fact, if you look at the written record, the people -- the list of experts who have endorsed this, it’s not just the Congressional Budget Office, it’s people like David Cutler, a professor at Harvard University, who won the John Base Clark Medal for the most accomplished economist under 40. It's people like Jonathan Gruber from MIT -- I know he quoted Jonathan Gruber -- Jonathan Gruber has said many times he endorses this bill. He thinks it's our best shot right now to get healthcare costs under control. It's people like Mark McClellan, who hasn said that he believes the Affordable Care Act will start to reduce healthcare spending, and why do we care about Mark McClellan? Because Mark McClellan ran Medicare in the Bush administration, and it’s people like the Simpson-Bowles Commission, the bipartisan fiscal commission said, The cost control in the Affordable Care Act will be affected, and we need if anything to double down on it. This is not my opinion, it’s not some crazy opinion, it is in fact the opinion of the best experts of left and right. "

    "data":"Thank you. To understand why FDA's caution is hazardous to our health, you have to appreciate FDA's growing focus on statistical outcomes over results for patients. Fading at FDA is a mindset of clinical medicine and patient care. And in it is a growing fixation on the statistical results, clinical trials, and a growing rule by math over medicine. This mindset can be seen in the triage that now hamper clinical trials and drug development. FDA imposes increasingly onerous experiments to try to ferret out benefits from new drugs. And FDA reviewers want the results of clinical trials to insulate them from critics; critics who say they're not doing enough about drug safety. But the laborious trials that result come at a very big, human cost. Higher degrees of statistical certainty under FDA's outdated way of designing drug trials require longer, larger, and increasingly impractical studies, especially when it comes to drugs targeted to unmet medical needs. Some promising therapies simply aren't being developed. Let me tell you one story of how this mindset impacts patients. Hunter's Syndrome is part of a family of related and extremely rare disorders. All are inherited. Each robs children of the ability to produce a crucial enzyme that's used by the body to break down certain sugar molecules found in the blood. Missing these enzymes, these molecules end up accumulating in places like the liver, and the spleen, and the joints, with often painful and debilitating consequences. Before treatment came along, parents had to literally sit idly by and watch as these diseases destroyed their children. But by the 1990s, drugs were developed that could function as replacements for the enzymes that were missing in these related disorders. These disorders were so bad and the drugs were so promising that the first of these medicines, a drug for Gaucher’s Disease called Ceredase, was approved on the basis of a very simple clinical trial that involved only a dozen patients. By 2004, FDA had approved enzyme replacements for four other conditions that were each very similar to Hunter's Syndrome. All were lysosomal storage diseases, where kids were born missing one of these crucial and related enzymes. It was understood that if you could replace the enzyme, these children were likely to derive a therapeutic benefit. But when an experimental enzyme for Hunter's Syndrome finally came along, a decade after that original drug was approved for Gaucher’s Disease, FDA's regulatory norms and FDA's regulatory culture had changed dramatically. In an effort to satisfy an increasingly demanding desire for statistical certainty, the FDA trial imposed extraordinary hardships on the children and their families. In order to approve the Hunter's drug, called Elaprase, FDA required that the trial enroll 96 patients. This was fully 20 percent of all the Americans afflicted with the disorder. And instead of testing the drug for six months, as had been done for every other drug, all of these enzyme replacements, FDA wanted a full year of clinical data, 52 weekly infusions in these kids. FDA also insisted that the kids be randomly assigned to receive either a drug or a placebo. There was no need to have a placebo in this clinical trial. The disease follows a very predictable pattern. And doctors already knew the normal decline these kids would have if they were left untreated. But leaving some kids untreated was basically leaving them to become disabled. Yet, including the placebo helped give the trial itself more statistical rigor for FDA. Finally, in past trials, with all these lysosomal storage drugs, these enzyme replacements, drugs targeted to similar diseases, FDA asked companies to measure surrogate markers that the -- the drug was having an impact on disease. Like the ability to shrink organs, like the liver and the spleen. That was interpreted as proof that the drug was breaking down the sugar molecules and they weren't becoming deposited there. And this would mean that the enzyme replacement was working. By looking at these surrogate measures, which you could measure over a shorter period of time, it was a way to accelerate the development of the drug. But in the case of the Hunter's drug, Elaprase, FDA decided to test the ability of the children to walk and to breathe as the clinical outcome it wanted. FDA saw this as a more rigorous way to see if the drug was working, but it came with hard trade-offs. It made the trial much longer than it needed to be. You had to wait years for the kids to become disabled to see if the drug was having its impact and to measure the result. And it tested the boundaries of what was ethical. Yet, this story is increasingly the norm when it comes to FDA review culture and it's played out multiple times in recent years, so much so that observers who follow the FDA now believe that the Europeans have become more flexible when it comes to drugs targeted to unmet medical needs than the Americans. The drug for bone cancer, the drug Pirfenidone for ideopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the drug Tafamidis for familial amyloidosis, all rejected by FDA in recent years because the statistical results didn't meet the agency's requirements, all approved in Europe, all embraced by European regulators. To understand why FDA's caution is, at times, hazardous, you have to recognize FDA's growing resolve to make sure the trials supporting drug approval meet an arduous but increasingly outdated standard for proving efficacy. As my debate partner, Peter Huber will show, this outdated model that FDA uses exacerbates these problems by making trials much more inefficient than they should be and allowing us to learn far less from the results than we otherwise can. Yet surveys of people with life-threatening disorders continue to show that patients want access to promising drugs sooner. They're willing to tolerate some risk. They're willing to tolerate the uncertainty. For patients with unmet medical needs, what kind of FDA do we want; an FDA that advances care, an FDA that gets new science to the patient more quickly? What we can't have is an FDA that's ruled by statistics over medicine. We can't have an FDA that focuses on its process rather than advancing patient care. Americans deserve a less cautious FDA and an FDA that actively embraces advances in science. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you very much. It is certainly the case that FDA, like any big organization, will occasionally not get things right. And I don't know the rare disease that Dr. Gottlieb mentioned, but I think we can all agree that in this very difficult balancing act of, “Is this drug going to help patients, is it going to perhaps make them sicker?” it is not an easy call. But I think the most important aspect of the question before us is, in general, do we want to have an FDA that is thinking very hard about risks and benefits and is requiring that the manufacturers who bring drugs to the FDA demonstrate that, in sum, the drug is going to be better for patients and not run the risk that we have all seen in recent years of a Vioxx or an Avandia that actually caused heart attacks and strokes because those problems were not detected. Now, there are a number of myths that underlie the proposition that I think it's important to just dismiss early on. One is that somehow FDA is the reason that we don't have more new drugs and that FDA is slower than other regulatory agencies. And in fact, these are questions that one can look at with real data. And the real data do not bear out the assertion that Dr. Gottlieb is defending. There is a very high acceptance rate by FDA of new drugs. In an article in Forbes from last December, it documented that 77 percent of drugs are approved the first time around, and a very high proportion of the ones where FDA says, “Please go back and find some more information out for us,” are then approved the second time around. In 2012, the FDA approved 39 new drugs, which was way higher than it has approved in any number of years for the last 16. It was a 16-year high. So FDA is indeed saying yes to drugs, and it is doing so at a rapid clip. That's the other myth that we need to disabuse ourselves of. In fact, the salaries of the FDA staff that review drugs are, for better or worse, half paid by the drug industry, which creates with it some deadlines that, as a result of the so-called user fees, the FDA must have its deadlines met. And for a priority drug, which is an important new drug that brings something to the table that we don't already have, that is needed by patients, that deadline is six months. And in the last year, 33 out of the 35 drugs that were brought to FDA met their standard, whether it was six months for a priority review or ten months for a standard review. You need a lot of time to be able to look at all of the adverse effects that happen, what is the degree of benefit. And again, I'm sure that there are instances where it could have been done better. And there certainly are ways that, as was mentioned in the early presentation by Mr. Rosenkranz, where we would like to be bring in genetics and bring in new molecular theories to approve drugs. And that's great, and FDA is trying very hard to move in that direction. But in fact, FDA is saying yes most of the time. It is approving drugs quickly, as per its requirements. And in a paper last year in the New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Ross and colleagues from Yale, reasonable university, reasonable journal, they look at whether or not the FDA was in fact slower than other regulatory agencies. And so they looked at the European medicines agency, which is the pan-European FDA equivalent, and Health Canada which is the Canadian version of FDA. And it found that, in fact, review times in the U.S. were shorter for FDA than they were for the Europeans and for the Canadians. And in fact for drugs that were approved in both places, 64 percent of the time they were approved first in the U.S. before in Europe, and 86 percent of the time, they were approved in the U.S. before Canada. So the myth that somehow FDA is slowing things down is not borne out by the facts. The reason we don't have as many new drugs as all of us on this stage and the audience would like to have is because the pharmaceutical industry is not bringing a lot of new drugs to FDA to approve. And they can't approve a drug that is not submitted to them. And yet they have this tension because they need to be able to have a drug brought to them, and yet they know, and we know, that manufacturers' enthusiasm, to put it as kindly as we can, about a product that they're trying to market, is perhaps not always going to catch all the down sides. And we've all seen examples of that. So there needs to be an agency that represents the best interests of the American public and can say to the manufacturer, “That does sound promising, but there are some things that you really need to look at, and if it's an important new drug, we'll get you an answer in six months.” I don't think that's too much to expect of a company to do, especially since we know that any drug that is powerful enough to make a difference in patients' lives is also powerful enough to do something that we don't want it to do and didn't expect it to do. And one cannot know that because of enthusiasm or because of medical need. There does need to be a cautious agency out there looking at drugs. And Dr. Challoner later will talk about devices, which is the other piece of FDA's responsibility besides food, which we're not going to get into. And we need to have something interposed between an enthusiastic company, which has billions of dollars riding on the success of its product, and the public health of the American people. And there needs to be a rigorous review. That rigorous review can be done quickly, it can -- and it is being done quickly. It is generally favorable. And just because we can make it better by informing it with genetic and other kinds of biological discoveries doesn't mean that we don't still need to have a traffic cop, kind of like an air traffic controller. We all saw a couple of weeks ago what happens when we have big government back away from having enough air traffic controllers. The FDA is the air traffic controller for our drugs, and that is why we need their caution. It is not the case that it's causing public health problems. In fact, they have gotten faster and faster over the past decade. And as a result, they are proving that they can help the American people be protected from drugs that have bad effects. And that's exactly what we need them to do. And that's why I think that it is important to vote against the proposition that FDA's caution is hazardous to our health. Thank you. "

    "data":"Well, in case you didn't know, our side actually won the first round of this debate in 19 -- no, in 1992, when we persuaded the FDA to adopt what is called the accelerated approval rule. Now, I must confess that the rule has been applied not very widely, but in two particular areas and not with whole-hearted enthusiasm, especially of late. But I intend to persuade you that this rule is, in fact, the only place that FDA today for we are actually making use of the very best, modern pharmacological science that we have. It is in fact the protocols that the FDA uses much more often, the un-accelerated approval, if you will, where we are actively obstructing the use of those technologies and is, therefore, in the standard protocols that the FDA has been using for a very long time that the FDA is actually hazardous to your health. Let me begin by giving you some brief context and a description of where this rule has been applied. Go back to 1988, a couple of biochemists from the United States and one British win a Nobel prize for their mastering of what is called a structure-based design. And this is one of the two processes that they've been using ever since to design, precisely, targeted drugs that can hone in on a molecule that is associated with some disease. This is some years after HIV arrived in town. And they quickly developed several drugs that can target different parts of HIV's chemistry, which, until very close to that time, had been completely incurable. The FDA licenses these drugs at absolutely record speed, applying its accelerated approval rule. And it soon becomes apparent that not one of them is going to be any good; not for long, not on its own. Because the virus mutates so fast that you throw any single drug at it and it very quickly develops a resistance to it. You just can't beat it with one drug. But doctors at this point, because the drug's been licensed, are now free to work things out on their own. And they very quickly began assembling these drugs in cocktails and that does the trick. The other -- the second area where the rule has actually been applied quite aggressively for the last 20 years, is oncology. And it's -- here's a brief picture of the kind of medicine that has emerged in that area. There are at least 10 biochemically distinct breast cancers out there. It's not one disease. We treat some of them with estrogen blockers. We treat others with estrogen itself. Okay. One of the estrogen blockers performs well only if you have the right liver. It depends -- it has to be metabolized by your liver. You know, some patients have the right liver, others don't. There are at least two other major receptors and two classes of drugs in breast cancers. And you mix them all up in various ways to try and beat the disease in the individual patient. We're finding similar levels of complexity and diversity in almost all of the major intractable diseases we're facing now: the neurological, the autoimmune diseases, and indeed, in many very common diseases like diabetes; they just aren't going to be beaten with one size fits all drugs. The underlying chemistry isn't going to allow it, which is bad news for the FDA, because the FDA's standard protocols are actually pretty good at getting licensing one size fits all drugs. But they are worse than useless, it turns out, when they encounter complexity. Using accelerated approval, the FDA can, in fact, handle complexity reasonably well. And it's going to do it even better. In your book, Dr. -- I'd surmise you'd not like this rule at all. You attribute its origins to AIDS activists who terrified the agency with a massive sit-in. Here's another view. The rule has allowed for the development of pioneering and lifesaving HIV and cancer drugs over the past two decades. That quote’s from President Obama's Council of Scientific Advisers in a report issued last September; and the report recommends that the FDA use accelerated approval much more systematically and broadly for all drugs that address an unmet need in treating a serious illness.  Notice -- this is why we have one lawyer for three doctors. Notice that the report did not endorse accelerated approval because it got drugs to patients sooner. It said that the rule allowed for the development of those pioneering drugs. But for the rule, we probably wouldn't have many of those drugs at all, which means that the benefits of that rule have absolutely dwarfed anything that our opponents here can possibly tell you about the rare side effects that might have been missed when that rule was applied. HIV has killed an average of about 20,000 Americans a year in the 30 years since it's surfaced in the United States. The numbers would have been horrendously worse if for the last 20 years we didn't have some good treatments for the disease in the place. We owe 40 cancer drugs and 15 new treatments to accelerated approval. They have given years of additional life to many patients. There is no story about safety and side effects that can possibly approach those numbers. So this magic rule doesn't just get us the drugs we need licensed faster. It gets them licensed when the other -- the FDA's other rules, the slow rules, just won't license them at all. How? In brief, it -- what it does is it loosens the FDA's grip on -- throttling grip on the process just enough to let doctors get involved and work out the really good drug science using the very best tools available. I want to briefly take the time to tell you how this is working, because, you know, it's not really that complicated and you can make your own judgments about how whether it makes sense. First of all, ordinarily, the FDA won't license a drug until it sees clinical symptoms. Accelerated approval will let you license a drug based on, say, its ability to lower HIV loads in the patients' blood. And by the way, it works in only one in 10 patients. The FDA can still license it. It'll make an ad hoc: “Oh, gee, that looks promising. We want it.” Okay? Under accelerated approval, therefore, the drug gets licensed much sooner. But it also gets licensed on a very different kind of evidence. The White House report makes clear that this is exactly what we should do. We should start with the premise that when we have a new drug, it may well be only one piece of a solution that's giving only partial benefits to a minority of patients involved in the -- you're sort of enlisted in the drug trial. The FDA standard protocols allow nothing of the sort. Under the current application of the rule, the FDA, again, in a very ad hoc way, says the drug company -- says to the drug company implicitly and doctors explicitly, “Look, work out the stuff -- the rest, you know, once you got the drug out there,” as they did with HIV. The White House report would systematize it. You know, you would gather torrents of information during the trials. And you would -- and you would use those to work out a drug -- molecular information. You'd use those to work out how the patients are doing and why some are faring well on the drug and others aren't. That kind of screening of patients and active rearranging the trial as it progresses is anathema under the standard FDA protocols. You're not allowed to do it at all. When you do it, you actually get to precision molecular medicine. You work out how a drug can be precisely prescribed to patients and used just right. The FDA is frozen in the headlights. It can't deal with these torrents. It has no experience with them. You need big computers to do it. It is hazardous to your health because it can't use the science. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you, John, and members of the audience. I will be speaking, as was said, against the motion that the FDA's caution is hazardous to your health, in particular, as it relates to the device side of the equation. The FDA is a public health agency. It is responsible for the safety and efficacy of the devices that are used by you, on you, and put in you. If anything, the anecdotes of the last decade would indicate that we need more caution in our systems. The evidence -- I think this will reverberate with most of you. The Shiley heart valve, implanted in patients, many patients, begins after several years shattering and embolizing to your brain and to your peripheral body and killing some patients before they could be replaced. The Dalkon Shield IUD: put in women, causing perforation of the uterus, pelvic infections, some deaths, much trauma. Chemotherapy infusion pumps, which were poorly calibrated so that the operators could make mistakes and would infuse drugs, toxic drugs, at ten times the rate that they should have because the wrong button was pushed, killing patients. Surgical mesh, vaginal mess. You've all seen these ads from the legal firms, I'm sure, soliciting your business. This was a surgical mesh that was used for hernia surgery and then was transformed to be used and promoted to be used in pelvic surgery for women with disastrous infection, and prolapse, and a variety of other results. Radiotherapy machines -- a liner accelerator. Again, without maximum controls, 10 to 20 times the dose is given to a patient for a pulmonary tumor and drills a hole through them. Pacemaker leads: put into you to manage your cardiac rhythm. And then after two or three years, widely distributed, many people not knowing they have them, breaking, and arrhythmias and other cardiac rhythm disasters were occurring. Metal on metal artificial hips. None of you could have missed that. Removed poorly, monitored in this country, used widely. Now, giving medical -- a metal embolism into patients and causing resurgeries and removals. Biliary stents that were approved for use in a very low pressure environment began to be used widely, and promoted widely by industry, for use in veins and arteries elsewhere in the body, in which they collapsed or did not work. So I'd say, with this kind of evidence, that the case is almost closed, and we could vote now. But I think the audience needs to understand exactly how we got to the point we're in. What is the process that has produced these problematic results? Well, the vast majority of medical devices used in healthcare in the United States are reviewed by the FDA before entering the marketplace, and are cleared. That's a very important word. They are not approved for human use in a process called premarket notification, or the 510 clearance process, which is named after the section of the authorizing legislation in 1976. And the FDA has to comply with this because it's legislated that they do so. And this was done 35 years ago in the face of rapidly evolving technologies. Then, stimulated by reports of problems, the public, legislators, the general accounting office, the DHHS inspector general and the courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States, have all questioned the value and logic of this clearance process which is being used by a federal agency charged with protecting and promoting the public's health. What are the major elements of this process? Well, premarket, before a device goes out and is sold to you or your doctor or your hospital, for no-risk devices such as tongue depressors or manual wheelchairs, for instance, there are about two-thirds of those that are considered by the FDA and go to market directly and are considered basically of no- or low-risk. The high-risk devices comprise about 1 percent of what the FDA device regulatory folks must deal with. And they do have to have costly and time-consuming premarket trials before approval. There's some question whether, in the device case, they are as powerful as those which already exist for drugs. The moderate risk 510(k) is the large middle ground. That's about 4,000 applications a year, and it's about a $3 billion a year industry, a very significant business. The 510(k) process was put in place by Congress and is not intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of devices. It cannot be transformed into a premarket evaluation of safety and effectiveness as long as the standard for clearance is substantial equivalence to a previously cleared device perhaps as early as 1976 or prior. So these are called predicates. And there's no assurance that a predicate is safe and effective. There's no practical way to remove these undesirable predicates, and you therefore have a daisy chain of approval requirements in the process. "

    "data":"Thank you. So I’m an economist which means I’m supposed to talk about efficiency, but I actually want to start, by talking about morality. And in fact I don’t want to start by talking about health care. Let me talk about something that’s going on right now. As we sit here there are several million people in the Houston metropolitan area, who are without electricity or running water. Been hit by disaster, they didn’t do anything wrong. They stayed in their houses because that was what they were advised by the governor of Texas to do, it was the right thing to do given the impossibility of evacuating a city that size and now, a lot of them are in trouble.Some of them can manage, some of them can now go and stay with relatives, some are in good health and, others are not, they’re in a lot of trouble. Now, do we think that the people who are in trouble, who are elderly, who are in poor health, who just don’t have the financial resources, whatever, to get themselves out of that situation, do we believe that, well look, you know, it’s not a government responsibility to help them, they should be left on their own. Well of course we don’t, I mean, I imagine there are some people who do believe that, but not many. They certainly don’t show their heads in our American politics. We do believe that if our fellow citizens suffer misfortune that is no fault of their own, and we can help them, that we should. Now imagine, some American who is in poor health and can’t afford medical care. Some American who is elderly and in need, trouble, or maybe not elderly, something’s gone wrong, someone who is trying to work but can’t get a job that has health insurance, someone who is in difficulty. Do we believe that that’s their problem, that we should not be taking care of them. And by the way, we’re not just talking about the 45 million without health insurance. We’re also talking about the roughly 75 million people who have inadequate health insurance. Health insurance that basically crumples, whenever it’s put to the need, we’re talking about a large part of this country, that does not have adequate health care coverage. Well I would submit to you that actually as a nation, we don’t believe that it’s appropriate to leave these people on their own. That we actually believe that the right thing to do is to help people, we don’t think that people should be protected from all of the risks of life but when there is something you can do, we believe that we should do it. And in fact by and large, if you ask people, should people have health coverage in this country, should people be guaranteed health care, most polls I’ve seen say that a heavy majority of the public thinks that they should. So then the question would be, well how is it that we don’t actually have that, how is it that we haven’t actually taken care of our citizens in the way that overwhelmingly, as a nation, we believe is the morally right thing to do, that as a matter of values, we think we oughta do. And the answer is of course that we’re told…well actually we’re told two things. We’re told first of all, that we already do it. That we already take care of everybody, and we’re also told, that it’s impossible to take care of everybody. Now you might think that it was impossible to believe both those things at the same time but, that’s why these guys are paid the big bucks. So we’re told that, well, look— And I can quote the President there. “I mean people have got access to health care in America. After all you just go to an emergency room.” And of course--I think we probably have a fair number of doctors here right--you know, it ain’t the same thing. First of all, going into emergency is no substitute for continuing care. And secondly, if you go to an emergency room, they will bill you. Now if you’re indigent, we’ve got the care all the same but you will get the bill and if you’re indigent maybe that doesn’t matter, but, for working Americans who don’t have good incomes, they’re terrified of emergency room coverage, and it’s—there’s something sick about our debate, that anybody can even claim that the emergency room is a substitute for universal health care. But the other argument is that it’s impossible. That if you try to have some form of universal health care, it’ll be terrible. It’ll be lousy quality, it’ll be wildly expensive. So people are told that a government insurance system can’t possibly work. It will be lousy insurance, it’ll be awful, it’ll lead to awful care… Which, now we’re going to hear a little bit I think later on about some of the international evidence, we’re going to hear about other countries. But you know, I—there’s a secret, I don’t know if people know about it but you know, there’s this program called Medicare. Covers every American 65 and older. It is, horrors, it’s a single-payer health insurance system run by the federal government. When it was being proposed, people said it would be terrible. You may have heard of something called Operation Kaffeeklatsch. Or you may not have heard of it. Doctors’ wives were urged to hold kaffeeklatsches, in which they would try to convince the doctors’ patients what a terrible idea this proposal called Medicare was, and they would play a recording by a fellow named Ronald Reagan, explaining what a terrible idea Medicare was and how it would lead, not only to destruction of health care, but actually the destruction of freedom, it’s quite something, you can listen to it online and, at the end, it basically says Medicare is the root to a totalitarian state. Well, it’s become as American as apple pie. Famous quote among, in the health care field is the, constituent who accosted Senator John Breaux saying, Senator, don’t let the government get its hands on Medicare. The fact of the matter is we have universal health coverage for our elderly already. The other thing that people say is that it would be impossibly expensive. Now, the truth is, a little-known other big secret, really have to go in deep research and actually look at a couple of official statistics that are easily available to find this out— In this country, the government already pays more health care bills than private insurers do. Medicare and Medicaid together, are already a bigger program than private insurance, all private health insurance. The reason is that we already cover the expensive cases. We already have the expensive cases. The elderly, the very sick who end up being bankrupted and therefore end up poor enough to get Medicaid are covered by public programs. What’s left, are generally lower-income working adults, and we pay an enormous amount to not cover them. The fact of the matter is that our health care system is wildly inefficient, largely because we have an insurance industry that devotes enormous resources to try to identify who really needs health insurance, so as not to give it to them. And we have health care providers devoting enormous resources, fighting with the insurance companies, to actually get paid. And the result is a wildly inefficient system. It would be cheaper, by far, to just cover everybody. We pay this huge price because we’ve managed to convince ourselves, or be convinced, that somehow, something that every other advanced country does, and that every other—that we do ourselves for the elderly, is impossible. Thank you—"

    "data":"It is intuitive to think that it should, that we have…very poor and helpless people and it’s the job of government, to help them, and, actually we have that, we have Medicaid. If you are poor, you are covered in America. It’s not a good system. It’s tempting to think that a wise government could step in. Paul Krugman has just said look at Medicare, people like Medicare. And that’s true. But, of course they like it, because, it gives you stuff free. People like that. But it’s unsustainable, it’s $35 trillion in the hole. That’s the unfounded liability of Medicare. They made promises to cover us when we’re 75, when the panel is 75, there’s no way they can possibly do that. Right now it’s working, because there are lots of young people and relatively few older people, but there’s just no way it can be sustained, if a private company tried to run its pension system that way I bet they’d throw the owners in jail. It’s a Ponzi scheme. Now, some people will talk tonight about the widely publicized data that America spends the most on health care, and we do, and studies have found that we have the worst result. But those studies are deceitful. They compare us by how long we live. But Americans are different. We drive cars more. We kill each other more often. Our accident rate, deaths on the highways triple that of the United Kingdom, we murder each other 10 times as often as the United Kingdom. When you take that out, we live longer than those other countries. And that doesn’t even include, diet issues, because we eat more and that kills people. A lot of these studies are skewed to make America look bad. Now many people say that the perfect system is in Europe where you have universal health care, and it’s true—most other countries do have systems like that. And it gets rid of the horrible anxiety that some people have in America, will I be covered. And that is horrible, and that does make people sick. But it’s better to be anxious, than to be in horrible pain. Or to be dead. And these universal coverage systems, they don’t guarantee universal access to actual care. In Canada, more than a million families can’t get a doctor. We taped in one town in Ontario where they have a lottery, they have a little box, everybody puts the family name in and, the town clerk pulls out a name, oh, you get to see a doctor this week. There aren’t enough doctors to go around, in Britain, one in eight patients waits more than a year for treatment in a hospital. The journal Clinical Oncology says 20 percent of potentially curable lung cancer patients, become incurable on the waiting list. Now why does this happen, well, because when everything is free, when the government pays for it…everybody wants everything. But the government doesn’t have infinite money so the government then must ration. And they do it by not giving you the latest, most expensive stuff, or they make you wait in line. In one town in England they opened a, a new office where you could get dental treatment, people lined up for blocks. Now most of them didn’t get in, so people pull their own teeth. The dental tools are pliers and vodka. This is not a good way to live. Still, despite the fact they spend less, European care is not remarkably inferior, it’s pretty good for most people. But that’s true only because they freeload off of us. Because most of the innovation comes from America. From the greedy profit-driven companies that want to take as much money from you as they possibly can, they’re the ones who gave us so much good stuff, the MRI’s, the CT scans. ACE inhibitors to lower blood pressure. The statins like Lipitor, to reduce cholesterol, coronary bypass surgery, hip replacement, knee replacement. What will the world be like if we have universal care and we don’t have America to invent those things? Yes, the private market is awful in many ways and wasteful. Health insurance companies waste all this money on advertising, paperwork, duplication, claims officers trying to make sure you’re not cheating ‘em. It is intuitive to think a single payer would be more efficient. And Michael Rachlis who will speak shortly has written that, a public bureaucracy is cheaper. And, I used to believe that, when I attended Paul Krugman’s university I was taught that, that the wise elites in Washington and state capitol can plan these things better than these competing companies. But then I became a consumer reporter, and I watched the market work. I watched government and private greedy companies trying to deliver services to people. And now I say that’s nonsense, government can’t do anything even close to the efficient way that private companies do it. When government pays for things, people don’t change, they don’t innovate, they keep doing the same thing they did to get paid.So, as an example look at the inefficiency of the private carcompanies. They waste millions in advertising on my program,I’m glad they do. And they run these gross ads, they sell cars notbased on their engineering perfection or safety, they sell sex andmuscle cars. They have these competing dealerships and pushy salesmen selling things like rust-proofing that we don’t need. Despite all of that, what’s the worst you get when you buy a car in New York? The worst you can get, is betterthan this, this is what the planned economies…universalcoverage gives us, and I apologize to those of you on the radio,you can’t see I’m holding up a picture of the Trabant, that East German car. This was the best those brilliant East German engineers could produce, it was an awful car, you had to put the oil and gas separately and shake the car to mix ‘em together. As soon as the Berlin Wall went down, this disappeared, because it couldn’t compete with the mediocre products that produced—were produced by our competing companies. I don’t want to have this kind of health care, and that’s what we’ll get if government runs it, at the beginning, government could do things well, you get the Peace Corps, New York’s public schools. But after a while it deteriorates because they don’t change, they don’t improve, maybe once every 12 years they change a little. If we have universal health care, this is what we’ll get."

    "data":"Thank you very much, John. And I’d like to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation and Intelligence Squared very much for inviting me to New York, I’ve had a wonderful time while I’ve been here. I also have a strong personal connection to the United States, my wife is an American and I visit her family on a regular basis and see the great health care that the United States has, and the terrible health care that this country has. And one is given to her father and one is given to her uncle, and the difference is insurance coverage. I’ve also slept overnight, I don’t want to give the impression I sleep around but, I’ve slept overnight in 23 US states and I have a pretty good idea of the health care system in this country as even my daughter has used it when she had a catfish spine through her palm in Florida. Now, as Paul has said, that this is very much a question of values. And it’s actually a case where you can have your cake and eat it too, in fact, you can only eat your cake if you have it, in other words, you can only get cost control if you—if you have equity. And as Paul has said, as we’ve heard others say, the US system costs the most in the world, it denies care to tens of millions of Americans and I have seen that personally. And the international performance and quality is just so-so. Does this really reflect American values. Is this really what you want out of your health care system. In Canada, our values for health care go back to Tommy Douglas, the premier of Saskatchewan between 1944 and 1961. And when Tommy was a boy in my hometown of Winnipeg, Manitoba, he developed osteomyalitis, an infection in his leg. There were no antibiotics at the time, the recommendation of the doctors were that his leg should be amputated. Fortunately Dr. Robert Smith, a noted surgeon, saw Douglas, told him that because he was an interesting case, he would treat him for free if he allowed teaching students to--allowed Dr. Smith to teach with him. Douglas was left with the impression all his life if he hadn’t been fortunate enough to run into Dr. Smith and be interesting, he would’ve lost his leg. Then a few years later, after Douglas’s government in Saskatchewan had implemented universal hospital insurance and universal medical insurance, despite the fact that in the 1940s being the poorest province in Canada, Justice Emmett Hall, a Supreme Court justice in Canada, and if anything a conservative, was asked by our then- Prime Minister, John George Diefenbaker, to review our health care system. His conclusion, was that we should move ahead with medical insurance ‘cause we already had hospital insurance. The main reason he gave was, efficiency. He said that it would be a lot cheaper to have a single-payer system, than to have multiple private payers. And so his vote was for efficiency. And those are the values on which our system are based. Equity and efficiency. What are the results? Fifty years ago we had the same as your country. We had the same health status. We paid the same amount for health care. Fifty years later, all Canadians are covered for hospitals and physicians service. In the United States millions have no coverage, and tens of millions have, have inadequate insurance. We actually get more of most services than Americans do. We have more visits to doctors every year, more days in hospital, more days in nursing homes, we take more prescription drugs than you do. I mean, not all of these things are good, too much health care can kill you. But even though there are some services we don’t get as much of, like nobody in the world does as much cardiac interventions as you do, the Belgians are close, but nobody really else is close, we actually do more bone marrow transplants. We do more lung transplant surgery. Toronto is an international center for lung transplants. And that, far from lacking innovation, we’re the country that brought you insulin, we developed bone marrow transplantation. When Paul Tsongas was telling the electorate years ago that he wouldn't have got his service in Canada, it greatly offended the two people, two doctors in Toronto who had developed the procedure. And all of this costs way less, ten percent of our GDP compared to sixteen percent in your country. How does that happen? Well, half of the extra expense is administration, because of the extra expense of this multiple payer system. The other half is due to higher prices because you don’t have effective cost control because you don’t have a single payer. Now, this must cost us a fortune, we must be basket cases. The Canadian Federal Government has run surpluses equal to one to two percent of our GDP for eleven years in a row. There’s no problem affording health care when you do it because you're concerned about other people. Then you can make it affordable. And our health status, of course, is not a true reflection, but in other, but from what you’ll hear, perhaps, from these panelists and others, you’d imagine Canadians are dying in the street waiting for medical care. In fact, we now live three years longer on average than you do. This is over a fifty year period, we’ve now got a three year longer life expectancy. Our infant mortality rates are twenty to thirty percent lower than yours. And finally, it’s a great boon to business in our country. The province of Ontario has, the last couple of years, has been assembling more motor vehicles than any US state including Michigan. The costs to manufacturers are nine percent of payroll for health care costs in this country, one and a half percent in Canada. That our manufacturing center is under pressure, but it would be gone without our health care system. So, Canada has done well, but Canada is not the outlier. Canada is the outlier in North America. Around the world wealthy countries, all wealthy countries that Americans would think of when they think of other countries they could live in, with a comparable standard of living, all other countries have a mainly public system. And Canada does have problems in its system, just as every country has its problems. Our problems are second order problems. We’ve dealt with coverage, and we’ve mainly dealt with affordability. So we, we have waits and delays in Canada, they're improving, but we do have them. But France and Germany have much shorter waits for care than you do in this country. So, despite the individual anecdotes that you're going to hear, health care in Canada or Germany or France are remarkably similar to the US. A recent letter to the editor by Lou Holman [PH] from Rochester New York reported on his heart attack in Toronto while he was visiting, and he was having his surgery within one hour of calling the ambulance. So, let’s get serious. Health care is pretty standard in most developed countries, we have similar problems in delivery, you are the only ones that really have problems with coverage and affordability. So, it comes back to values. If you focus on equity, you get a bonus. You get cost control. If you focus on cost control, you don’t get equity or cost control. And I strongly encourage you folks to vote for our side. Thank you."

    "data":"And I'm still Canadian, and proud of it. I am against the proposition that universal coverage should be the responsibility of the federal government. I do think that everyone here would agree that the key goal for America is affordable, accessible, quality health care. The question is, how do we achieve that goal? There are two competing visions for health care reform in this country today, and also for achieving universal coverage. One focuses on government, mandates, and taxes, while the other focuses on free markets, innovation, and empowering consumers. Today that government vision is on the rise. The long term goal of most liberals is a Canadian-style, single payer, Medicare for all, health care system. These liberals tell us that socialized systems like those in Canada and Europe are better and cheaper and can provide universal coverage for all of us. They also site, as Michael did, life expectancy and infant mortality as evidence of the superiority of these systems. Well, let’s look at life expectancy. People who make this claim usually note that life expectancy is higher in Canada and Europe. The World Health Organization ranking does not measure, though, the quality of a health care system. The World Health Organization ranks systems that treat people equally higher than those that treat people well. Now let’s look at infant mortality. The US does have a higher infant mortality rate than Canada, hence their government system is rated better. The reality is that the United States, with its superior neo-natal care facilities, has allowed more high risk babies to live. But this also pushes the infant mortality rate higher because of a greater number of at risk births, babies being born. And in other countries many of those at risk babies do not live and are not counted in infant mortality statistics. Earlier this year, a woman in Calgary was expecting quadruplets, there wasn’t a single neo-natal unit for that woman to deliver her babies. She was airlifted to Great Falls, Montana, a city of fifty-five thousand, where she successfully delivered her quads. I'm from Vancouver, Canada, I was home three years ago visiting my mom, and the front page story in the Vancouver Sun was, “Pregnant Mother with Twins Airlifted to Edmonton, Alberta.” When they came back, the husband, in the interview, on the front page of the Sun said, the Canadian Health Care System is that of a third world country. Now let’s look at adult cancer survival rates. A study published in the August, August issue of the British Journal Lancet Oncology said that America is much better at treating cancer than Europe or Canada. Researchers found that Americans have a better survival rate for thirteen of the sixteen most prominent cancers. For example, breast cancer survival rate among American women is eighty-three point five percent, whereas in Britain, seventy percent. American men and women are thirtyfive percent more likely to survive colon cancer than their British counterparts. Now, I have discussed the data, but let’s look at the reality of universal coverage systems in Canada and Europe. Michael Moore, in his movie Sicko, where I have a cameo appearance, points to the wonderful health care systems in Canada, France, England, and Cuba, and he says they're all free. The US does spend, as has been pointed out, sixteen percent of its gross domestic product on health care, while Canada spends on the range of ten to eleven percent. The reason that Canada spends ten to eleven percent is because the government sets a global budget and says, that’s what we’re spending. And what is the result? Long waiting lists for care, rationed care, and a lack of access to the latest technological equipment. Today in Canada there are eight hundred and twenty-seven thousand Canadians waiting on a waiting list for procedures. There are three point two million, or ten percent of our population, waiting to get a primary care doctor. The average wait in 2007 from seeing a primary car doctor to getting treatment by a specialist was eighteen point three weeks. That’s over four months. Canada ranks thirteenth out of twenty-four OECD countries in MRI’s, and eighteenth out of twenty-four in CT scans. When I turned fifty, I know it’s hard to believe that I turned fifty, but I did, my doctor in San Francisco said, you have to have a colonoscopy. And I said, well, there’s nothing wrong with me, I don’t need a colonoscopy. Well anyway, I had one. But my mother in Vancouver, Canada, three years ago, July, started feeling ill and was convinced she had colon cancer. But her doctor kept saying, you're old, there’s nothing wrong with you, go to bed, sleep more. Finally in December my mom started hemorrhaging from her colon. Her doctor said, you have to go to the hospital in an ambulance to get service in the emergency room--I could not take her. After being in the emergency room for a number of hours she was then transferred to the transit lounge where she waited for two days to get a bed in a room. But she was not counted as waiting in an emergency room because she was in a transit lounge. The issue is that she was too old, it was decided by the health care system, to have a colonoscopy, when she was convinced that she was ill. And what about people with government coverage wait and wait in socialized systems, except the politicians. Belinda Stronach, former Canadian MP, opposed any privatization of Canadian health care. And yet, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in June of 2007, on the advice of her doctor, she flew to UCLA and had her breast surgery and paid for it herself. As my friend in Vancouver, Dr. Brian Day, orthopedic surgeon, and head of the CMA, Canadian Medical Association, told the New York Times, Canada is a country in which your dog can get a hip replacement in under a week, and in which humans wait two to three years. Is this the kind of government run health care system Americans desire? Think about the post office. Think about the DMV and the handling of Katrina. A majority of Americans rate the quality of our, our system as excellent, or good. In Canada, according to Decima, only thirty-three percent rate the system as a grade A or B, and twenty-two percent say it’s failing. Canadians intuitively know that long waits are the outcomes of government run systems. While we can no longer deny there are problems in health care, markets, consumer choice, and innovation will solve them, rather than putting the government in charge."

    "data":"Thank you. Actually, I'm not a surgeon, I am just an ER doc, and I don’t have the distinguished background of my fellow panelists, but I have treated thousands of patients, insured and uninsured,and I’ve also broken bad news to hundreds of families. I want to tell you about one of them that I’ll never forget. It took them two hours to reach Atlanta from the north Georgia mountains. I faced them across the outstretched body of their son. The ventilator hissed rhythmically, ten breaths per minute. I spoke first. Your son was in a terrible crash, I said. The ambulance crew could tell he was severely injured and called a helicopter. He reached us about three hours ago. He has several injuries, a collapsed lung, internal bleeding, but these aren't his most serious problem. His brain injury worries us the most. That’s when his mother interrupted me. She said, doctor, I don't know how to ask you this, but I must. My husband lost his job six weeks ago, I work, but my employer doesn't offer health insurance. Is my son going to get the care he needs? Momentarily taken aback, I replied, ma'am, you're at Grady Hospital, one of the finest trauma centers in the south, I swear to you, we will do everything in our power to save your son. I meant what I said that night, but I didn't tell her the whole truth. I didn't tell her that our best probably wouldn't be good enough, and that if her son survived he’d probably be disabled for the rest of his life. I didn't tell her that she and her husband would be billed for the helicopter flight, and the days or weeks to come in the intensive care unit, and that the total would probably reach a hundred thousand dollars, maybe a whole lot more. I didn't tell her that she and her husband would empty their savings and mortgage their home in an effort to pay the bill, and that it wouldn't be enough. And that the coins put in a coffee can at the local diner wouldn't come close to covering the difference. I didn't tell her that the unpaid balance of her son’s bill will push Grady hospital closer to insolvency, closer to its own crash, and if Grady closes, north Georgia, a region of more than five million people, will lose its only level one trauma center, its only burn unit, its only poison control center, its only emergency psychiatric unit, and seven hundred and fifty inpatient beds. And that’s not all. If Grady closes, metro Atlanta’s private hospitals, already overburdened by population growth, will topple like dominos one after another. Ladies and gentleman, for me his debate is not an idle intellectual exercise, it’s about lives. Three hundred million American lives. I support this resolution for three reasons. First, because our failure to cover every American is a national disgrace. Second, because we’ll never achieve universal coverage if we don’t make health care in this country more affordable. And third, because the only way we can make health care more affordable and cover everyone is through a well-regulated health care marketplace, and to do that the Federal Government must be involved. Now let me be clear, the majority of Americans do not want a government-only health care system, but they absolutely want the government involved, as a referee, as a cop, to make sure that everybody plays by the rules. The other side of this debate will try to convince you that rising health care costs are due to government interference. Well, they’ve got it backwards. The problem is not government interference with the health care industry, the problem today is health care industry interference with government. That’s why the business of medicine is booming. Record profits, huge executive salaries, bonuses, health care costs spiraling out of control year after year after year. But the caring side of medicine is failing. On the front lines, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals are nearly as frustrated as you are. The nation-wide crisis in emergency care is a case in point. Every major challenge we face, ER’s packed with patients, dangerously long waits to be seen, a half million ambulances a year turned away to more distant hospitals, and fewer specialists than ever willing to take ER call. All of them are due to the fact that the economics of health care encourage hospitals to favor elective cases over emergency cases. Good for business, bad for patients. And it’s terribly expensive. Country music star Dolly Parton once quipped, you have no idea how much it costs to look this cheap.The same can be said about American health care. You have no idea how much it costs to run this poorly. We spend two trillion dollars a year on health care, and a trillion dollars is a lot of money. Put this in perspective, a million seconds ago was last week. A billion seconds ago Jimmy Carter was inaugurated president. A trillion seconds ago was thirty thousand BC. For two trillion dollars we can take good care of everybody in this country and have a lot left over, and you don’t have to look outside the US for proof. If everybody practiced medicine as efficiently as they do in Rochester, Minnesota and Salt Lake City, Utah, Medicare could pay thirty percent less to doctors and hospitals, and everybody would get better care. But it won't happen on its own, because one person’s waste is another person’s revenue stream. That's why we need a cop on the beat, and the only cop with the clout to get the health care industry to play by the rules is the federal government. My side has given you several reasons to vote for tonight’s resolution, but the most compelling one of all is your own self interest, because a health care system that doesn't work for everyone may not work for you when the chips are down. Take it from me, an ER doc, no one can predict when a life threatening emergency may strike, but if it does, you’ll want your hospital to go the extra mile, not your ambulance."

    "data":"Thank you. We do have a moral obligation to care for those who are in need of medical care, but that’s not where the disagreement lies tonight. Where we disagree is over whether universal coverage is going to help us fulfill that moral obligation, or as I will argue, make that moral obligation harder to fulfill. So, you’ve heard a lot of things about how wonderful universal coverage will be. You’ve heard that it will probably be all things to all men and women. They’ll make us taller and thinner and it’ll save us money. So let’s look at a couple of the actual likely effects of adopting universal coverage here in the United States. First off, it’s not going to save us money. Yes, other countries do universal coverage, and they do it on the cheap, or they do it for less money than we do, but there’s absolutely no way that can happen in the United States, and here’s why. Expanding insurance coverage means more people are going to go to the doctor, more people are going to use medical services. That costs more money. The urban institute estimates that it would cost at least a hundred and twenty billion dollars. That’s at least, it’s going to cost a lot more than that. Now, with the government in control, it’s tempting to think that we would be able to ratchet that spending down over time so that we’re more in line with other, other nations. But with the government in control of the, whatever universal coverage scheme you can dream up, the industry is going to prevent the government from doing just that. Art Kellermann is right, the industry does have too much influence over government spending in the Medicare program. And they use that influence to prevent the government from reducing, from reducing spending, from eliminating inefficient spending, wasteful spending. They’ve done it for Medicare’s entire history. So although it’s tempting to think that we could do health, we could do universal coverage, and we could have, and we could save money on it in the process, we would have an easier time moving the uninsured to Switzerland than we would have moving Switzerland’s spending levels here to the United States. Now, you’ve also heard that universal coverage would improve the quality of care. We actually have some pretty systemic problems when it comes to quality here in the United States. I'm not a big proponent of the US health care sector. The experts tell us that if you have, the uninsured only get recommended--what the evidence says, is the best recommended care about half of the time. But you know what, quality problems are so systemic that people in Medicare, in Medicaid, and people in the United Kingdom’s national health service, which is their universal coverage system, also only get quality, what the evidence says is best care about half of the time. Government, and then the reason is that government doesn't pay for quality, and it’s been lagging in the private sector in coming up with quality improving innovations. Now in the private sector we have the same quality problem, but I’ll have more to say about that in a moment. One big quality problem is that we have alarming rates of medical error here in the United States. Universal Coverage is not going to help to prevent these medical errors. It’s not going to help nurses read doctors’ chicken scratchings and avoid the errors associated with those. It’s not going to encourage physicians and other clinicians to wash their hands between patients so they're not passing on infections. Nor is it going to prevent errors by encouraging doctors to follow standardized protocols when inserting a central line. The same institute of medicine, I'm surprised this statistics hasn’t come up today, but I’ll bring it up, the Institution of Medicine, the commission where Dr. Kellermann served, estimated that eighteen thousand Americans die every year from lack of health insurance. I believe that. That seems plausible to me. The same Institute of Medicine, however, estimated that up to a hundred thousand Americans die every year due to medical errors in hospitals. All universal coverage is going to do is bring more people into that system, broken system, it’s not going to do anything to fix that system. And yes, we might save the one, this one life over here, from this person who didn't have health insurance. We’d be ignoring these five deaths over here. Another quality problem that we have in the United States is we have alarming disparities in health outcomes. We have disparities between different racial groups of fifteen to twenty years in terms of life expectancy. And some Americans face mortality risks similar to what you see in Russia and sub-Saharan Africa. Universal coverage is not going to do anything to solve that problem. Sherry Glied, who’s the head of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University wrote recently, quote, socio-economic differentials in health are large and growing, and appear to be growing, uh, in countries that have universal coverage as well as those that do not. End quote. Now, it’s true, universal coverage may save some lives. It may save this one life over here. So that seems to be something in its favor. But actually here the news isn't even all that good, because health economists tell us that if you have a dollar to spend on improving health, there’s absolutely no evidence that spending that dollar on universal coverage is going to get your more of an improvement in health than spending that dollar on any number of other things, including clinics, reducing medical errors, improving nutrition, fighting poverty, or even improving education. So, ironically, to vote for universal coverage does not show how much, how much you care about your neighbor’s health, it actually shows how little you care about your neighbor’s health, because you're willing to forgot he added health benefits that might come from some of the, from spending that dollar on some of those other strategies. Now there is something very wrong with America’s health care sector, something that universal coverage will not solve. You can see what’s wrong, you can see what it is, I think, when you look at the Veteran’s Health Administration. Now I can't remember if this has come up already, if Professor Krugman mentioned the Veteran’s Health Administration. But this is hailed by people who support universal coverage as how, as exhibiting the superiority of government when dealing with the problems presented by health care. I think that the VA story is very important, but I don’t think it tells the story that supporters of universal, of universal coverage think that it tells. The VA has made impressive strides, using electronic medical records, to focus on preventive care, improving quality, avoiding medical errors. The reason is not some inherent superiority of government, the reason is really just two features of the way the VA is organized. They're called integration and pre-payment. If anyone cares we can talk about what those mean later on. But those features are not unique to the Veteran’s Health Administration. They exist in private health plans all over the country, you know them as plans like Group Health Cooperative, Kaiser Permanente, and those plans are using health information technologies to reduce costs, improve quality, and reduce errors. Now why don’t you have electronic medical, electronic medical records, like you have electronic financial records? Why doesn't the hospital remember your medical history, your child’s medical history, your allergies, and these sorts of things? Well, the biggest reason is America’s pursuit of universal coverage. Medicare is America’s great experiment with universal coverage, and it’s also the largest purchaser of medical care in the nation. And Medicare actually penalizes doctors and hospitals if they use electronic medical records to reduce costs, or to avoid medical errors. Electronic records help avoid duplication, but Medicare pays for duplication. So, if you adopt those, you make less money. Health information technologies avoid, help to avoid medical errors, but Medicare pays for medical errors. So, if you adopt those health information technologies, you lose money. So, providers make less money if they do these things that are in patient’s interests. Meanwhile, supporters of universal coverage are trying to keep those private health plans that use these things from participating in Medicare. With doesn't Medicare stop paying for duplication and errors? Because government resists change. So, I don’t think the VA success, the VA success has demonstrated government’s brilliance so much as how government actually impedes the support of quality affordable health care. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you. Everyone in this room uses performance-enhancing technology and drugs. We use cars and computers to make our work more efficient. We use caffeine, alcohol, and Viagra to improve our performance. We send our children to fancy schools and Suzuki lessons to improve their cognitive skills, and enhance their musical ability. And every athlete in recorded history has used performance-enhancing drugs. Babylonians and Romans used herbs to improve their performance in battle. Naked Greeks put on shoes to run faster. Kenyan runners trained at altitude to improve their oxygen-carrying capacity. And runners everywhere carbo-loaded before races to enhance their performance. Why then, do we have a replay of the Salem witch trials? To discredit, humiliate, and incarcerate, uh, elite athletes for doing what has been a standard practice for millennia? And why, out of the thousand and one ways in which athletes enhance their performance, have steroids and growth hormone been selected for particular vilification? The short answer is that they’re illegal and that these athletes are breaking the rules and perhaps the law, and therefor it’s immoral. But this begs the question, as Mr. Rosenkranz said, why are they banned in the first place? We contend that the reasons given are morally incoherent, wreak of hypocrisy, and are based on ice cold wrong information. I will identify six reasons that are offered why we should ban these drugs. Number one, critics say that they confer an unfair advantage. But advantages are only unfair if they’re unequally distributed. The usual solution is to expand access. When Bob Seagren showed up at the ’72 Olympics in-, with a fiberglass pole, it was not banned, but, a-, uh, there was a time to allow others to practice with it, and it was incorporated. When Kenyan runners were found to enhance their performance by raising their hemoglobin by training at altitude, the reaction was not to ban abnormally high hemoglobins, or to prohibit others from training at altitude, but to encourage everyone to do it. The unfair advantage aim, uh, the unfair advantage claim is further undermined by rampant hypocrisy. In the ’88 Olympics, when Ben Johnson lost his gold medal because of steroid use, on the same day and the same press den, Janet Evans, the American swimmer who had won the 5k swim, bragged about the greasy swimsuit that we had kept secret from the East Germans. Johnson used a drug that was available to everyone, although illegally, virtually on the training room tables. Evans used a secret technology available to none of her competitors and bragged about it. The press cheered American ingenuity and made Johnson a pariah. Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, preaches about a level playing field, but presides over a league where the Yankees’ payroll is three to four times that of most competitors, including my beloved Brewers, and guess what? The Yankees always make the playoffs. Two, critics say these drugs are harmful, but they rely on information that’s wiley-, wildly exaggerated or just fabricated. We are told repeatedly that these drugs use heart disease, cancer, and stroke, while human growth hormone has been given to almost a million children for fifty years, and there’s still no real serious side effects that have been discovered. Oral testosterone dis-, did cause liver cancer, but for twenty years athletes have been using injectables, which have never been associated with cancer. Lyle Alzado the football player, was a poster child for the horrors of steroids. He died of a brain tumor. Then the New York Times and Sports Illustrated told us on cover stories that this was due to steroids without a single quote from an informed physician or a single source showing any association with steroids, because there is none. But still, Costas, I mean, excuse me, uh, Alzado…eh…Alzado is constantly rolled out as a poster child for the horrors of steroids. I ask you in the audience to quickly name, in your own minds, a single elite athlete who’s had a stroke or a heart attack while playing sports. It’s hard to come up with one. Anabolic steroids do have undesirable side effects: acne, baldness, voice changes, intrangent infertility. But sport itself is far more dangerous, and we don’t prohibit it. The number of deaths from playing professional football and college football are fifty to a hundred times higher than even the wild exaggerations about steroids. More people have died playing baseball than have died of steroid use. Three critics say that allowing their use is coercive, that you’re forced to use them. But the first year that baseball did universal testing, anonymous testing, only six percent of the players were positive. From those numbers, it seems that 94% were able to play at a very high level and didn’t feel coerced at all. Coercion is the use or threat of force that's never occurred in this country to the best of my knowledge. There is no entitlement to play professional sports; it’s a privilege requiring an enormous sacrifice and taking on enormous risks, with or without steroids. Many walk away from it and choose not to do it, and no one is forced to take it on. Four, critics claim that steroids undermine fan interest, and this is simply empirically false, baseball attendance has ridden steadily in the steroid era, professional football is even more popular, and Barry Bonds, widely assumed to be a steroid user, is the biggest draw in sports, adding ten thousand fannies in the seats everywhere he goes. Chicks love the long ball, guys love the long ball, they don’t care what they're using. Fifth, critics claim that steroids undermine the integrity of records. This is naïve, the records arenot comparable with or without steroids or growth hormone. Baseball fences are shorter, the mound is lower, the ball is livelier, and Coors Field is a mile above sea level. By one estimate, Babe Ruth playing in today’s ball parks would hit a thousand home runs, not the mere seven hundred and fifty that Hank Aaron and Bonds have hit. The only valid comparison is with peers playing in the same arenas with the same equipment against the same opponents, and Ruth hit more home runs in one season than any other team. He is in a league of his own, and no one has come close. Finally, critics claim that steroids present bad role modeling for children—Everyone agrees these drugs should be banned for children. The adverse effects are different, they stunt growth, they are not competent to make informed choices. I support testing in schools, not to punish the kids, but to catch the peddlers. Anyone caught selling drugs to children should be hung, followed by a fair trial. In closing, when you go out to dinner tonight, enjoy the wine that relaxes you, or start your day tomorrow with a double mocha latte that gets you going, but please be less critical of others who, like you, try to enhance their performance in a variety of ways. Thank you."

    "label":"health",
    "data":"Thank you. This evening’s debate deals with one of the most important problems facing sport today: doping, the use of performance enhancing drugs and methods. It’s important because it affects the health of the athletes who practice it, and those who emulate the sport heroes thought they admire. It’s important because it goes to the very heart of sport and its integrity. I want to focus on two elements in this portion of my remarks: health and integrity. So let’s start at the beginning. Sport, like this debate, is governed by rules, to which the participants agree. In fact, the rules are the essential element of sport as we know it. Some of them may seem arbitrary, why the race is a hundred meters as opposed to ninety-five or a hundred and five, but they are the rules, and they are the rules on which we agree. One of those sport rules is that participants do not take certain drugs or use certain methods for performance enhancement. And also, we should be clear here, until there is a rule against the use of something, it may be foolish, it may be of conduct. Don’t get led off into the wilderness by examples from ancient Greece and so forth that preceded the rules that we now face today. Once there is a rule, however, that becomes the deal, and part of the game, whether the rule relates to drugs, equipment, or anything else central to the sport. And those rules become our deal with each other’s, other, as participants. If you don’t like the rules, unlike society in general, you're not obliged to participate. You can find somebody who wants to play by the rules that you prefer. Almost all of the prohibited substances and methods have the potential to damage the health of the athletes. In the 1950’s and 1960’s before there were rules, veterinary products were used to beef up the human cattle. Shot putters went from throwing from sixty feet to seventy feet. It’s true, they had terminal acne, testicles the size of jelly beans, a sperm count of zero, and were in a perpetual rage, but boy, they could sure toss the shot a lot further. The initial anti-doping rules were adopted mainly as a result of concerns regarding health. A Danish cyclist died during the 1960 Olympics in Rome, that was the Olympics in which I participated. And he died as a result of drug use. He didn't just get sick, or incur a long term health problem, or fall off his bike and skin his knees. He died. If a particular sport rule proves to be no good or unnecessary, or in need of amendment, the sport can change it. There’s no problem about that. But you as a participant cannot do it unilaterally and clandestinely. Why do you suppose that no one, no one with any responsibility, let me underline that, is willing to say let the athletes do whatever they want? Even the professional leagues don’t say that. They know perfectly well there’s a danger to health. With the rules comes a question of trust. We have expectations of each other that we play in accordance with the rules that we agreed upon as part of our participation, including rules prohibiting drug use. We’re ready to demonstrate that compliance at any time, that’s also part of our deal. We don’t hide behind spurious claims of privacy. We agree on the penalties if there’s a breach of the rules. And the sport rules on drug use are no different from sport rules regarding such things as gambling. Pete Rose has been kept out of the Baseball Hall of Fame because of gambling, because nobody was really sure whether they were watching real sport. In the, in more modern times, my, my view is that Henry Aaron has a record, Barry Bonds has a number. When there’s a breach of that trust, you have to see what it is. And drug use in sport is no more or no less than cheating, and in most cases, dangerous cheating. Remember that, that athletes don’t take these drugs to level the playing field. They do it to get an advantage. And if everyone else is doing what they're doing, then instead of taking ten grams or ten cc's or whatever it is, they’ll take twenty, or thirty, or forty, and a vicious circle simply gets bigger. The end game will be an activity that’s increasingly violent, extreme, and meaningless, practiced by a class of chemical and/or genetic mutant gladiators. The use of performance enhancing drugs is not accidental, it is planned and deliberate with the sole objective of getting an unfair advantage. I don’t want my kids, or your kids, or anybody’s kids to have to turn themselves into chemical stockpiles just because there are cheaters out there who don’t care what they promised when they started to participate. I don’t want my kids in the hands of a coach who would encourage, condone, or allow the use of drugs among his or her athletes. I was always struck by Vince Lombardi, a wonderful coach. There’s one thing he said that I wish he hadn't, when he said, Winning is the only thing.” It’s not. I liked it much better when he said, If you're not fired with enthusiasm, you will be fired with enthusiasm.” That’s a much better message. So, going forward, what we need is an increased change of attitude. Cheating in sport destroys everything—…that the athletes set out to accomplish. It turns them, among other things, into liars. Marion Jones persisted with a lie for more than seven years. Ben Johnson lied to me in 1988. I was really looking forward to having him here tonight, twenty years later. It’s too bad his lawyers pulled him out of this at the last minute. But attitudes can change, even big attitudes like this. If, if ten years ago I had said that in ten years from today it would be illegal to smoke a cigarette in a restaurant in Paris, you’d have laughed. So, it’s important for me to keep up, keep the question of doping and drug use from becoming banal and being turned into various shades of gray. The issue of cheating is not gray, it’s black and it’s white. Drug use may not affect fan interest, but it should, and that's our failure as fans, compounding the failure of drug-using players in the leagues. Are these really our personal values, that dangerous cheating is what we stand for? Bishop, let me finish with Bishop Fulton Sheen, he had a great thing. He said, if it’s wrong, it’s wrong. Even if everybody is doing it. And if it’s right it’s right, even if nobody’s doing it."

    "data":"Well, let me start by saying, for those of you who might be confused, I am not Ben Johnson. On the train ride from DC this morning, we passed through Baltimore. Doing so reminded me of one of my favorite authors, Baltimore native H.L. Mencken, who I think would have had a good laugh at the hypocrisy, the posturing, the uh, moral prudery that’s associated with this steroid controversy. Eighty years ago Mencken aptly summarized this debate when he wrote, quote, The urge to save humanity is almost always a false face for the urge to rule it.” So why are we here tonight? Is this about saving sport, or is this about some people imposing their view about what sport should be? If we’re here to talk about fairness in competition, I'm dubious. Take representative Tom Davis, one of the more cam-, camera hungry politicians to demagogue this issue. After the 2000 census, Representative Davis maneuvered to have his Congressional District gerrymandered to include as many Republicans as possible, ensuring his continual reelection, eliminating the real number of options for his constituents to vote. He ran the next year unopposed. Davis also snuck a, a provision into an unrelated piece of Federal legislation preventing an apartment complex from going up in his district because, he told the Washington Post, he feared it would bring too many and he’s lecturing baseball players about fairness. If we want to talk about the health risks of professional sports, we might discuss the ballooning weight of NFL lineman over the last twenty years, or the corresponding life, drop in life expectancy that’s come with it. Or you might talk about the particularly hellish world of thoroughbred horse racing jockeys, who subject themselves to sweat boxes, diuretics, suppositories, and intentional eating disorders. In fact, any world class athlete subjects his body to stresses it wasn’t really designed to endure. And as we’ve seen with government bans on consensual activity, from alcohol to gambling to cocaine to prostitution, prohibitions not only don’t work, they make the activity in question more dangerous by pushing it underground. So what about the children? Survey data actually shows that teen steroid use has mirrored the use of other elicit drugs over the years. It went up mildly in the 1990’s, and has since either dropped off slightly, or leveled off since 2000. It’s likely that the same trends that govern cocaine or marijuana use govern teen steroid use far more than what’s happening in the sports pages. In fact, a study released last year, and one of the few studies to actually attempt to find out what motivates teen boys to take steroids, found that the most reliable indicator of steroid use was a teen’s own self, self esteem and body image. The suggestion, and I think we can all agree it’s pretty intuitive, is that teenage boys who do take steroids do so not because they want to look like Barry Bonds or Mark McGwire, but because they want to look good for teenage girls. So what is this debate really all about? I’d suggest it’s about paternalism, and it’s about control. We have a full blown moral panic on our hands here, and it’s over a set of substances that, for whatever reason, has attracted the ire of the people who have made it their job to tell us what is and isn't good for us. Our society has an oddly schizophrenic relationship with pharmaceuticals and medical technology. If something could be said to be natural, we tend to be OK with it. If it’s lab made or synthetic, we tend to be leery. But even synthetic drugs and man-made technology seem to be OK if the aim is to make sick people better, or broken people whole again. And so when we talk about expanding or transcending what we consider to be normal, uh, then a certain uneasiness starts to set in. There was an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education last month about university professors taking stimulants like Adderall to increase their academic productivity. Oddly, the article quoted, quoted several professors who considered this cheating at academics. I have to confess, I really don’t understand this way of thinking. Academics is the search for truth and knowledge, if a drug can make that search more productive with few side effects, why in the world wouldn't you take it? It’s also important to note that what we consider completely natural and acceptable today was quite out of the ordinary not too long ago. A hundred years ago life expectancy in the US was fifty, today it’s seventy-eight. Thanks to technology, medicine, and pharmaceutical, we’re today taller, stronger, faster, healthier, and expecting to live longer than ever before. Genetically advanced agriculture, anti-aging technology, and other advancements we’ve yet to see today will likely push our longevity even farther. It’s an old cliché that sports is a metaphor for the human condition, but there’s a lot of truth to that. As technology helped humanity obliterate a lot of these milestones, and helped us move beyond what, until a hundred years ago, had been a long, bleak history, similar advances over the years in nutrition, training, and using technology to improve technique have enabled sports records to fall with astonishing regularity. Sports is about exploring and stretching the lengths of human potential. Going back to even the pre-modern Olympics, when athletes ate live bees, and ate crushed sheep testicles to get a leg up on the competition, uh, sports has never been about physical ability alone. It’s been, been about ingenuity, innovation, and knowledge about what makes us faster and stronger, and avoiding what might do us harm. It’s always been part of the game. It shouldn't be surprising, then, that many of the biggest proponents of banning performance enhancing drugs in sports are also suspect of some of these continued advancements in human achievement. Leon Kass, former, formerly President Bush’s top advisor on bio-ethics, this is the same Mr. Kass who champions rigorous sports testing, has also spent much of his career actually lamenting the fact that human beings are living longer than ever before. He considers this contrary to some odd concept of natural order. Uh, of course there have been luddites and naturalists like Mr. Kass standing athwart the tide …of human progress for much of human history. The essence of the agreement today I think is what people like Mr. Kass and some of our opponents tonight, they have a decidedly different definition of what’s pure, natural, and human than what I do. I think the difference is that I'm sort of willing to take a live and let live approach and let everyone sort of explore their own boundaries and their own potential. Um, whereas I think some of our opponents are more interested in opposing their view of what is natural and what is, uh, human on everyone else, which of course brings us back to Mencken. I think, uh, our opponents want to legislate away what they believe are bad decisions, and if a free society means anything, it means we should be able to all decisions, including the bad ones. Thank you."

    "data":"To, to accept this motion would simply set us back. Accurately just mentioned, studies, recent studies are showing that young athletes and high school kids are, are using performance enhancing drugs to a lesser degree. To legitimize, um, the performance enhancing drugs in sports I feel would send the wrong message to young athletes. There are certainly legitimate uses for human growth hormone and steroids, um, as, as we all know. That’s why they’re a controlled substance under a doctor’s orders. But to hit a baseball further, or to run a hundred yard dash faster is not the reason and the legitimate use of these, uh, of these drugs. Um, Dr. Fost mentioned that at one point in time there were six percent that were using, um, performance enhancing drugs in the major leagues. It really makes my point exactly. Ninety-four percent of the guys were not using, then that tells me that you don’t need these things to be the best athlete in the world, that there are plenty of legitimate ways to get bigger, stronger, and faster that everyone has access to, equal access to. Um, if accepted, what about those, for instance, in Major League Baseball, what about those who do not want to use it? The playing field, then, once again, is, is not level. Um, the only way, someone said earlier, the only way you could probably make this work is that if you forced everybody to take performance enhancing drugs, which um, we all know wouldn't work. Um, people do not want to see, I would argue the point that people do not want to see performances, uh, based on, uh, false premises, that it is, it is their ability, athletically or psychologically or mentally, alone, um, that if it’s being enhanced people do not want, accept that. You mentioned Barry Bonds adding, um, seats, um, fans in the seats every game he played. I would have to say that in San Francisco he was, um, generally accepted, but everywhere else he went, I think those ten thousand extra went there to jeer him and his accomplishments. After the season, after all this has come out with Mark McGwire, I think most of us look back now and say we got caught up in something that we really didn't want to support. If there was no alternative, I could understand us giving into this problem. Certainly there are a lot of problems that young people have and society has. But this is one of them. If, uh, if there are a, a percentage of young athletes still taking performance enhancing drugs, to me it’s still a problem. Um, and if there was no answer to, uh, this problem I think I would understand giving in, and voting, uh, in favor of this motion. But I believe that there is a pro—there is an answer to the problem. And, uh, as was mentioned earlier we look at smoking in public. Uh, we— most of us grew up with that being totally acceptable and now it’s against the law, there’s truly been a culture change. There can be a change in culture in professional athletics, and I believe that it is starting. We need, uh, better testing, harsher punishments, and, and people will decide not to get involved with performance-enhancing drugs. Uh, gambling in baseball is the perfect example. Um, the culture of, uh, professional baseball players is the one thing they know, and, and one thing they learn from the minute they sign a professional contract, is that if you gamble on the game in any way, shape or form, your career will be over. Uh, my understanding is, uh, I don’t have any statistics to show this, but once one of the greatest hitters, uh, is kicked out of the game because he gambled on the sport, that reinforced the culture in baseball that you don’t gamble on baseball. I believe we can change the culture, and to accept this motion, really would set us back with the progress that we have made. After tonight, I think you will see—you will feel, uh, as you listen closely, that, you feel as I do, that there is no sustainable, logical, reasonable, um, uh… reason, for these things to be accepted. If you put any of these, uh, alleg—these, uh, positions under scrutiny, I think you will all come to understand, that we simply do not need this in sports at any level. Let alone the high school kids that see professional athletes and are tempted to use them. If you put an age limit on use, you’re still gonna have abuse at the younger ages. To me it’d be much better…to change the culture and the idea and the thinking about competing in sports. And we are making progress, and studies have shown that. Certainly we don’t want all of our athletes to look like the American Gladi—Gladiators or professional wrestlers. Um…if, if that’s what we want, with all of our ath—athletes, um, then I can understand that but I don’t think that’s what the public wants. As far as baseball is concerned, certainly people like the long ball. Um, but, uh, this, this past year was, in the la—in the last 10 years, this past year, had the seventh fewest home runs of the last decade, and yet we broke records again with attendance. Attendance is good, home runs do not have to be up. People love the game, they appreciate the game, they appreciate finesse. Um, again, we don’t all want to look like professional wrestlers out there and I don’t think that’s what the fans want. Um…uh…I think the, uh, um…the thing too you need to be careful about is drawing, uh, as—as was mentioned earlier is drawing, um, the opposing side, drawing, drawing analogies and conclusions, with things that really are not, uh, are not comparable. For instance— um, um, comparing, uh, anabolic steroids or performance enhancing drugs to the Greeks wearing tennis shoes. Or to the ancient Greek athletes, uh, eating bees. This is not what we’re talking about and that is not—to me does not compare, what we’re talking about, is drugs that are a controlled substance that have very many good, legitimate uses. As was mentioned over a million kids take human growth hormone, they don’t take human growth hormone without exhaustive studies to make sure that they are not already producing enough on their own. When kids abuse these drugs, and athletes abuse these drugs, I don’t think there’s any question that we know, uh, that there are side effects. And some of ‘em we do not know now. Especially with our use. What concerns me is the example that the athletes at the highest level set for our youth. I feel like we’re making progress and a vote in favor of this motion would, would, uh, be definitely a step backward, backward, in our efforts to, uh, correct this problem. Thank you."

    "data":"First, let me again thank you for inviting us to this debate. I think it's a critical issue for the country. I'm delighted to be on the same stage with such distinguished scholars and authors. I think, though, if I'm not mistaken, that the other side has essentially conceded the proposition for which we are arguing, and that proposition is that freedom of the press has to give way to state secrets. Now, nobody is arguing that the proposition means everything that the government has in its possession is a state secret, nor are we arguing that simply having a single public official asserting that something is a state secret ends the analysis. But I think where the dispute has come down to is who actually makes the decision. Is it the government and the government process, which is what our contention is and our proposition is, or is it the press. Does the press get the final say? Now, I will agree with Professor Dershowitz that in the first instance, the right way to deal with this problem is for the government to control its own secrets. And most of the time, the government succeeds in doing so. Although the press is constantly making the argument that as a matter of law, they ought to have access to those secrets. And those arguments are relatively routinely rebuffed. But the reality is that there are times people do leak secrets. And sometimes they do it for what they may conceive to be noble motives. Sometimes they do it for purposes of settling scores or personal advancement. And sometimes they do it perhaps because they want to hurt the United States. And in those instances, it is not enough to say that because the government has failed to keep the secret, the secret ought to become public and ought to be published widely. National security and human life cannot be the subject of a cat and mouse game. And so I would argue that actually the existing system, which does require freedom of the press to give way to genuine state secrets is pretty much the correct balance. How does that work? Well, first of all, if the press wants to get a secret in the possession of the government, it's very difficult to do so. And there's a very strong presumption against simply open access to very significant classified material. But we do have cases where the material gets out. And there, I believe the law allows, if the facts are there and the intent is there, a prosecution to take place as a way of deterring somebody from publishing that secret. And that's in fact what the law basically is. There are statutes in the books that permit those prosecutions. When the courts have been confronted with those prosecutions, and those are relatively rare cases, the courts have upheld the principles of those prosecutions. Even in the Pentagon papers case, at least five of the justices and probably seven, indicated that there were instances where a prosecution might be appropriate even if not in that particular case. And even with respect to prior restraint, the issuance of an injunction to prevent publication, most of the justices on the court have acknowledged in the case of a very strong and dangerous release of information, for example, the proverbial publication of information about the movement of a troop ship, it would be appropriate to rejoin the publication of that material. And that's because the courts recognize that in the government process, a combination of executive action, congressional action and judicial action is the best mechanism for balancing between state secrets and freedom of the press. Now, the press often argues we ought to be the judges. And the difficulty is that the press is sometimes a flawed judge of what is in the public interest. First of all, the press is not a monolith. As Professor Dershowitz pointed out, we're not concerned about The New York Times. We're worried about people who blog. But the First Amendment doesn't distinguish between The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and al Manar, which is the news organ of Hezbollah. Or extreme blogs on the right or the left. All of those are part of the press. Nor do we want to have the government start to license particular organs as organs that can be trusted and organs that can't be trusted. The fact is if we say that state secrets have to give way to the press when the press gets hold of them, then we mean it has to be any member of the press, a blogger, a Hezbollah journalist, somebody who works for a news organ run by the government of a foreign country. And I don't think any of us believe that would be prudent or safe. Is the press right even when we deal with the venerable institutions that we're so familiar with? Well, the press sometimes also makes mistakes. Several years ago, there was a publication by The New York Times. I know David Sanger knows about this, of information about a program that allowed the United States government to see what was going on in the financial transactions that were being executed through a program known as Swift.  And this was critical in tracking the flow of money that was used to support terrorist activity. Precisely one of the recommendations that was made by the 9/11 commission against the very strong request of the Bush administration, that material was published. And the original argument was, well, this is something people need to know about because it's potentially illegal or requires some kind of oversight. But what emerged after a period of time is it was completely legal and that there was nothing wrong about it, and nobody's privacy had been improperly invaded. Everything was done according to an appropriate process. And therefore, the public ombudsman of The New York Times had to write a retraction. He had to write a piece in the Times saying that while he had originally endorsed the publication of the Swift material, he had changed his mind, and it was not appropriate because it turned out that there was nothing wrong with it, and there was no powerful interest served in releasing that material. And then he made an interesting and telling confession, that he had originally endorsed the disclosure because he didn't like the administration and the way the administration was treating the paper. And I suggest to you that that's the problem with having the press make the decision. The press is no more in a position to separate itself from its interests than anybody else. But unlike the organs of government which are accountable to the public and to each other, the press is accountable to nobody. And that's why I strongly urge you to support the proposition that we're advocating tonight. Thank you very much. "

    "data":"Thank you very much. And it's wonderful to be here and to be with such a great panel. In Schoenfeld's book, if you haven't read it, it's a wonderful accounting -- historical accounting of the tension between the press and the government. Michael Chertoff has done a fabulous work and we have talked over many years on many different subjects, and I agree with almost everything that my partner here had to say except when Alan Dershowitz declared that you shouldn't necessarily trust everything that you read in The New York Times. We’ll take that aside later on. I come to this as a practitioner, not as a legal expert. And I come to this knowing that the tensions that we are discussing here today are as you've heard as old as the Republic. The New York Times among other newspapers had reporters embedded with Civil War troops, Union troops, and at one appropriate moment or another, several generals having read the reviews of their strategy, took those reporters and put them in the brig. I've been around more than a few government officials who have suggested to me over the years as we have debated various stories that we were getting ready to write that what was good for General Sheridan would be perfectly good today. I would argue that in fact it is impossible, it is impossible to separate out state secrets from what appears every day in The New York Times and other major newspapers around the world. It is impossible because you cannot discuss the subject of whether or not we should have gone into Iraq, or how quickly we should get out of Afghanistan, or the issues surrounding cyber war that we deal with each and every day now, without daily venturing into territory that is classified somewhere and somehow. The problem is, as a reporter, I probably don't even know when much of that material is classified. And I can tell you as someone who went through the WikiLeaks material for many months before The Times and other newspapers published them that I was pretty surprised by some things that were stamped “secret.” I came into the office one day and asked if anybody knew why every American embassy that collects the morning news accounts that would appear in the Spanish press or the Chinese press and collates them and sends them off to Washington so that they would have a sense of what's appearing in those press reports each day. Somebody on the way out the door, as they are putting that cable over to Washington, stamps “secret” on them. They had appeared in the newspaper that morning. What does that tell you early on? It tells you that you cannot have a system in which you keep state secrets from being published if almost everything is a state secret. And my friend, Michael Chertoff, points out that the press is a flawed judge of the national interest. That is absolutely true, but a better judge than the U.S. government because when you read the U.S. government's own regulations for what gets made classified, what that stamp goes on, the rules only discuss national security considerations. There is no category that makes the person who's got that stamp in the hand weigh a public interest. Only the press can do that and only after the information is out. Now, there's a second issue around this which the other side pointed out, which is that only the executive, they said, really has the full knowledge to make those decisions. But in fact I think what you heard in the discussion of the constitutional origins of all of this is that the founders believed that to give the executive complete discretion in this area is to create a country that isn't like the America that we know. You would get Egypt under Mubarak; you would get the Chinese press today. And Americans feel that deeply. Just think about the criticism directed at The New York Times when we failed to go as deeply as we should have into the evidence concerning the justification for going into Iraq. It would have been wonderful if we could have published more about what the U.S. government knew about whether weapons of mass destruction existed. Eventually, we were able to. But at the time we were doing that reporting, it was all deeply classified, except for those tidbits that the U.S. government decided to release to support its own case. Now, we are hardly indifferent, as reporters, to the question of what the consequences of these actions are. We live in New York and Washington. Our kids ride the subways. We have reporters who are out all across the world. Many have been kidnapped. A couple, unfortunately, have been killed. A wonderful photographer for The New York Times lost both his legs just a few months ago, stepping on an improvised land mine in Afghanistan. We know that the violent jihadists, who we write about each and every day, have no interest in a free press. And we're not here to side with them.  We are also not here to be propagandists for the U.S. government. And you don't want us to be. If you think, briefly, about some of the stories that we have held back on, we held back for a year on the story on warrantless wiretaps that President Bush authorized. Eventually, we published it. Congress decided to rewrite the law. We held back for three years -- on a story I worked on for some time -- about a secret U.S. government program to help secure Pakistan's nuclear weapons. We held the story because the government was fearful that if we published it too soon, we would be giving al-Qaeda or the Taliban directions into how to get to those weapons. And we published stories that are quite controversial including one earlier this year about Stuxnet, the computer virus that many believe the U.S. government had a role in developing. It was used against the Iranian nuclear program. What possibly could be the interest in that? Very simple. If the U.S. government -- if any other government -- is starting off a cyber war, well, we are the country that is most vulnerable to that problem. And we could be subject to attacks in response. So, these are central policy issues. These secrets are not merely published because they are cool stories. They are published because there is a debate that the public has to conduct. Thank you. "

    "data":"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. The gravity of the issue we're debating here tonight cannot be overstated. At stake is nothing less than preventing a reprise of the kinds of attacks that befell our city and our country nearly 10 years ago. To keep our country secure, our government inevitably generates a great many secrets of many different kinds. We cannot disclose all of the methods by which we track terrorists. We cannot publicize the vulnerabilities of our bridges and tunnels and buildings. We have an absolute duty to conceal things like the blueprints for nuclear weapons or the formulas for substances like aerosolized anthrax. But equally at stake is the character of our democracy. We live in an open society, and secrecy is antithetical to the democratic idea. Secrecy can be used as a cover for corruption and wrong-doing. And we depend upon a free press to keep us informed about what our government is doing in our name, including the things that it's doing in secret, or at least some of them. And indeed the foreign affairs pages of our major newspapers are filled with stories based upon reporting drawn from state secrets. And that's the way things are, and that's the way they ought to be. But even as we have a press that we want to be delving into state secrets, it must do so under the rule of law. That is the press must be vulnerable to prosecution when it violates the laws governing secrecy. Now here, as Robert Rosenkranz mentioned, we run head long into the First Amendment. The First Amendment says that Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech or the press. But, of course, we live with numerous abridgments of free speech and free press, all widely accepted by the public and upheld by the courts. We can't libel one another. We can't engage in false advertising. And of course, it's forbidden to yell, Fire -- falsely yell, Fire in a crowded theater like this one. Now, Congress has enacted several statutes that criminalize the publication of state secrets. The Espionage Act was mentioned but one might also point to the Atomic Energy Act that makes it a crime to publish classified material pertaining to the design of nuclear weapons. Or the COMINT Act which makes it a crime to publish classified information pertaining to cryptography, or code breaking, or the Intelligence Identities Protection Act makes it a crime to publish the identities of undercover CIA officers and other intelligence officers of the U.S. government. Now, these laws are all in obvious tension with the First Amendment, but no court has ever struck them down. And it is a statement of fact, ladies and gentlemen, the proposition under debate here tonight, the freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets, is inarguably true. Valid laws are on the books that criminalize the publication of certain state secrets. Now, does the existence of such laws mean that every time a journalist like my colleague here, David Sanger, publishes a state secret he should be prosecuted and marched off to prison? Absolutely not. That would be foolish in the extreme. That's why we recognize that our government is promiscuous with the secrecy stamp. It marks lots of things secret that need not be. And back when I was an editor at Commentary Magazine, I myself published classified information and I would do so again. The real question raised by the proposition is whether the press can and should be prosecuted in those instances when it places the country in danger. Such danger is not purely hypothetical. Back in the 1970s there was a magazine called Counterspy that began to publish the identities of hundreds of CIA officers around the world. In 1975, it outed Richard Welch as the CIA Station Chief in Athens. And no sooner was his name disclosed that he was murdered by a Greek terrorist organization as a direct result of that revelation. Today we have WikiLeaks which in the name of transparency has indiscriminately dumped thousands of secret diplomatic and military cables onto the Internet. Now, some of those documents are innocuous. And many of them without question help us better understand what our government is doing around the world and what other governments are doing, but some of them are outright dangerous. One WikiLeaks document, a U.S. Army document that they put on the Internet, describes the technical details of the jamming devices used by our soldiers in Iraq to scramble the signals that insurgents were using to detonate roadside bombs. Now, I ask you is there any reasonable person who believes it should be legal to publish the secret countermeasures used by our soldiers to keep from getting blown up on the battlefield? Is there any reasonable person who believes it should be legal to publish blueprints for making nuclear bombs -- or should it be legal to give out the recipe for -- to publish the recipe for making aerosolized anthrax? Those are questions that I hope we will receive straightforward answers to tonight from David Sanger and Alan Dershowitz. If they believe those things should be allowed, I hope they'll fully and frankly acknowledge the costs, and if they think those things should be prohibited by law, well, then they'll be agreeing with the very proposition that they supposedly came here to oppose. Ladies and gentlemen, freedom of the press does not, cannot, and should not extend to state secrets. Not all government secrets warrant protection, but some clearly do. And if you in the audience agree with what Justice Robert Jackson once memorably said, that the Constitution of the United States is not a suicide pact, I urge you to vote for the proposition at issue here tonight.

    "data":"Thank you. It's a distinct pleasure to be arguing with two such distinguished people -- Gabriel Schoenfeld, whose book I reviewed for The New York Times, and reviewed very favorably. And I admire much of what he writes, but we disagree, and you'll hear the disagreements. And Judge Michael Chertoff, whose work as a public figure deserves all of our appreciation. He has helped protect us for so many years. And of course, my distinguished colleague who will be arguing on my side. The proposition is far too broad. “State secrets” encompass far too much. And even the criteria used by my opponent -- quote “places the country in danger” -- is far, far too broad. Let me start with a story that one of my dissident clients told me in the 1970s, when I was representing Soviet dissidents in the bad old days of the Soviet Union. The joke went around during Stalin's time that a dissident was arrested for the crime of calling Stalin a “fool.” And he came to court and he said, “I didn't commit a libel. I want to defend myself. I will prove that what I said is truthful.” And he said, “You don't understand. You're not being charged with libel. You're being charged with revealing a state secret!” And that's precisely the kind of state secret that we often seek to protect. Now, you don't have to be Stalin. Remember, everybody knows -- every newspaperman memorizes the famous quote of Thomas Jefferson that he made before he became a president. He said, “Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.” That was pre-presidential Thomas Jefferson. Now let me read you a quote six years into his presidency: “A man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them. And as much as he who knows nothing is nearer the truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors.” Thomas Jefferson sought to censor the press. We all know that he opposed the Alien and Sedition Act. Of course he did, because that was federal legislation. But he supported state legislation that would have censored the press and protected him from embarrassment. Now, you just have to look in today's New York Times to see how foolish some of these state secrets that are protected tend to be. Finally, finally, the Pentagon papers are about to be declassified and released. I defended Senator Mike Gravel against the charges of reading the Pentagon papers -- what was it -- 40 years ago! And Daniel Ellsberg, in today's Times, I think aptly states the reason why the Pentagon papers were censored for so long. He said, “The reasons are very clearly domestic political reasons, not national security at all. The reasons for the prolonged secrets are to conceal the fact that so much of the policy making doesn't bear public examination. It's embarrassing or even incriminating.” You don't have to be as cynical as Ellsberg -- and Ellsberg is not one of my heroes. I agree with Gabriel Schoenberg's analysis of Ellsberg for the man. But the point is a very, very important one. Secrets get disclosed all the time. And the issue is not whether secrets will be disclosed. If you read The New York Times, if you read Bob Woodward, if you read Seymour Hersh, you understand the question is who decides which secrets are disclosed to whom? When? Secrets get disclosed. Bob Woodward has its sources. Why do people talk to Bob Woodward? Why do they give him classified information? Why do they give Seymour Hersh classified information? Because those are secrets that government officials want to have revealed. So the question is not “Should state secrets be subject to the First Amendment?” The question is, “Should the government -- the executive branch of the government -- be making the decision as to which secrets to withhold and which to reveal?” Secrets should be kept. And the primary responsibility for keeping secrets lies with those who have those secrets. If you look, for example, at how WikiLeaks got disclosed, the alleged culprit there is man -- a private named Bradley Manning -- who have never should have had access -- such easy access to the material that he disclosed. That was negligence on the part of the government. As Julian Assange, I think, aptly put it, “The best way to keep a secret is not to know it.” And if the government wants to keep secrets, they have to do a better job of preventing them from being leaked -- and not put the burden on the press. And by the way, I mean not only leaked WikiLeaks style, but leaked Bob Woodward, Seymour Hersh style, the kind of selective leaks that we've come to grow accustomed to. There are very limited numbers of secrets that deserve to be protected. And they can be listed and catalogued. You listed some of them. I agree with some. I disagree with others. The names of troops, of the nature of weapons. But you mentioned a couple, for example, methods used to track terrorists, vulnerability of bridges. Those are very complicated. We have a right to know, at least in broad terms, what kinds of methods are being used, whether they're constitutional or not. We have a right to know if our bridges are vulnerable, not how they're vulnerable. These are very, very hard judgments. So you can agree with our side of the proposition while conceding that there are a limited number of things that should be kept secret. And I believe -- and here we have a real disagreement. You wrote in your book that you would prefer to leave this to the good judgment of prosecutors, the discretion of prosecutors and the common sense of jurors. What I would prefer to see is a complete starting from scratch with the Espionage Law of 1917. Scrap it. It tells us nothing. And draft a very narrow statute that says you cannot disclose the nature of certain kinds of weapons. You cannot disclose the movement of troops. You cannot disclose the names of spies. That is not state secrets, broad general concept. That's a limited number of things that need protection, not protection from The New York Times because the Times won't publish them, but protection from Internet people who will publish almost anything without any kind of accountability. There must be a strong presumption in favor of freedom of speech and sunshine as the best disinfectant. The government says, Trust us. No. Don't trust the government. The New York Times says, Trust us. Don't trust The New York Times. Trust the process of checks and balances, whereby the government tries to keep secrets. The press tries to release the secrets. That process is the best guarantee of liberty. Thank you. "

    "data":"Well, thank you. I think largely what we have tonight is a debate about the First Amendment and what it means and whether we still value the First Amendment. Do we want to keep the First Amendment the way it was written, or do we want it to say something else? And who will say what that something else is? First, let's review what it says. It's pretty simple actually. The part that we're talking about tonight is Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech. Well, I'm sorry to inform that we have a lot of laws abridging freedom of speech and regulating speech. The Supreme Court has said there are now 30 different types of regulations on political speech. We have laws and regulations that come to -- close to 400,000 words. But these words are not clear enough so the Federal Election Commission has already issued close to 1,900 advisory opinions that you must review to know what the law means. And on top of that, there have been nearly eight -- 7,000 enforcement actions by the Federal Election Commission during its history. To really understand the law, you need to understand all that. And the fact is no one does understand what the election law means. In fact, if you want to speak out about politics and elections you have to hire a lawyer like this one over here. I don't know how much he charges, but most grassroots groups probably can't afford it. And if they don't have a lawyer, they're probably going to make mistakes. I lived under this, working at a political committee. I saw the regulations firsthand, and we -- a lot of this we're getting very upset with how complicated it was and the fact we couldn't get an answer to many of our basic questions. On top of that, in 2002 Congress passed the McCain-Feingold Act, and for many of us that was the last straw. A portion of that -- not all of that law was bad, but there was one portion that many of us found offensive no matter what our views on politics. Part of it said that within 60 days of an election, a group that you were a member of could not run an advertisement mentioning the name of a congressman if it aired on radio or TV. That was illegal. Now, the court has overturned that, but it took them a number of years to do that. I thought that was outrageous. And there is no group fighting on the political front for the First Amendment. We hear about groups fighting for Second Amendment rights but not First Amendment rights. That's why I started SpeechNow.org because I think we need a group to fight for our political free speech rights. Now, I designed this group in a way that I thought would allow us to be effective. In fact, one of our panelists who doesn't support free speech -- unfettered free speech has adopted the SpeechNow.org model, which is now called a super PAC. And basically here's how it works. It's Americans getting together and pooling their money. I talk to you. I make the case as to why you should donate money, so then we can talk to other Americans. That's what the SpeechNow model was. There was only one problem with it. It was illegal to do that. So the SpeechNow.org with the assistance of a couple of public interest law firms sued the FDC, to make a long story short, we won. That case, SpeechNow.org versus FDC, is what created the super PAC. Now, let me explain how these groups are actually functioned, because these are different from normal PACs. These are different from political parties. These are literally Americans getting together independently. The Federal Election Commission calls these groups independent expenditure only committees because that's all they can do. We don't make any donations to candidates. We don’t make any donations to political parties. We don't coordinate our speech with the candidates. We don't coordinate our speech with the political parties. All of our donors over $200 are disclosed to the public on the Internet on the FDC website. And all of our spending is donated -- is reported as well. That is what the media has come to call a super PAC. So when you think about it, what's wrong with that? It's basically a group of people getting together and saying, Hey, we want to speak to our fellow Americans about what direction we think the country should go, what leaders we should elect, who should represent us, and we're not going to give any money to the candidates or the parties. That's what a super PAC is. Now, this model has been so popular that there are now 805 of them that have formed since June of 2010 when super PACs first became legal. Now, I want to tell you a story of how important money can be in making speech. And I will go back to 1967, when a U.S. senator named Gene McCarthy wanted to run for president. The incumbent president, Lyndon Baines Johnson, was a very powerful political figure. Today most people would think it'd be impossible to take down a sitting president in a primary, especially if you started in November previous to the election year. But Gene McCarthy did it. And you know how he did it? He went to a handful of people, about five people, and they gave the equivalent in today's dollars of $10 million, $10 million. Now, that's the kind of money that we're talking about in super PACs, but back then, the money went directly into Gene McCarthy's campaign committee. Gene McCarthy was opposed to the Vietnam War. He wanted to make his run for president based on opposing the Vietnam War. And he wanted to help build a movement to help end the Vietnam War. He couldn't have done it without those contributions. He couldn't have done it. And you know what? He did it. He didn't win the nomination, but he forced LBJ out of the race. And it's the only time since -- since we've passed these campaign restrictions, we have never seen a sitting president removed by a challenger. And I daresay it probably won't happen for many, many years. So if you believe in the right of the people to change their government, we have to give people the right to do everything they can to speak to other Americans. And independent political groups are the way to do it. Thank you. "

What we have learned over the last 200 years, by sad experience, is that our government can be corrupted by campaign money so that it primarily responds to the sources of money that fund elections -- special interests and big political contributors and spenders -- rather than representing the people and seeking the common good. So tonight I'm going to look at how campaign money can corrupt our government and why, for 100 years, there have been limits on money spent in politics to try and control that corruption. Then, my debating partner Jonathan Soros will explain why super PACs and their related nonprofit C4s and C6s only make the possibility of corruption greater. Theodore Roosevelt began this national discussion in 1905 after being elected president with huge contributions from Wall Street. He actually had Mark Hanna. And Mark Hanna had what we would call super PAC money, unlimited contributions from corporations that elected Roosevelt. Afterwards, those corporations came to him for their reward which they expected would be less government regulation. Roosevelt responded by saying to Congress, All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law. Directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes. Later, he said, Every special interest is entitled to justice, but none is entitled to a vote in Congress to a voice on the bench. Congress reacted to Roosevelt's call by passing the Tillman Act in 1907 forbidding corporate political contributions in federal elections. Later in 1947, the Taft Act extended this prohibition to labor unions and to independent expenditures. Roosevelt and the Congress believed that the election of representatives of the people to Congress should be left to individual citizens and voters, not corporate or union interests almost always seeking special legislative favors in return. Under President Richard Nixon, these prohibitions were violated because of a lack of disclosure. Then in the Watergate scandal, these hidden violations became public. We learned that the Department of Justice had dropped an antitrust case against ITT in return for $400,000 given to finance the Republican convention where Nixon wanted it. We might never have known that except an ITT lobbyist wrote it all down in an internal memo which then saw the light of day. The result was that after Watergate, Congress passed new reform laws and tried to require the disclosure of all money given for political purposes. These laws were later revised and strengthened in the McCain-Feingold law in 2002. As Senator Alan Simpson said at that time, too often members' first thought is not what is right or what they will believe, but how it will affect fundraising. Who, after all, can seriously contend that a $100,000 donation does not alter the way one thinks about and quite possibly votes on an issue? The goal of each of these laws was to prevent actual corruption, the selling of government action or inaction in return for financial support for candidates and campaigns. Just as important, though, has been the goal of avoiding the appearance of corruption. As the Supreme Court said in the Buckley case in 1976, Congress has the right to deal with the reality or the appearance of corruption inherent in the system, permitting unlimited financial contributions. The Supreme Court also recognized one other reality in that case which is central to our debate today. There is a significant difference between my speaking myself or giving my money to someone else for their speech. My own speech and my own words has higher First Amendment protection than a contribution. That brings us to the world of super PACs. They were created, as we heard, by the Supreme Court Citizens United decision and the DC circuit's SpeechNow case. The majority in Citizens United, overturning previous decisions, said that in their view of the First Amendment, corporations had the same right as individuals to make unlimited, independent expenditures in federal elections because such spending does not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. The court based this new somewhat novel view that independent spending can never corrupt on two important predicates. The spending must be totally independent of candidates and political parties, and it must be fully disclosed so that in the words of Justice Kennedy and Citizens United, the public can see whether elected officials are in the pockets of so-called money interests. So are their spending totally independent of candidates? Do we have full disclosure? Jonathan Soros will tell us in a few minutes. "

    "data":"Thanks. I feel a little bit under qualified for this debate because I think I'm the only panelist who has not created a super PAC. Although I briefly contemplated starting an anti-anti-super PAC super PAC. It seemed too complicated to me, but maybe Trevor could help me out. So I'm talking instead from the perspective of somebody who has been writing about civil liberties issues for about 25 years now. And I see this as fundamentally an issue of freedom of speech. Consider the legal situation before the Citizens United case. Wealthy individuals were free to speak without limit. Jonathan's father, for example, spent about $24 billion during the -- or excuse me, million dollars during the 2004 election season to defeat George W. Bush. And more power to him. Media corporations such as the ones that own FOX news and the New York Times were also free to speak without limit. Parties and candidates could spend as much as they wanted on political messages, although the contributions for them were limited. By contrast, unions, businesses and nonprofit advocacy groups such as the NRA or the ACLU, could not talk about their issues on the air close to an election if they happen to mention the name of a candidate for federal office. Furthermore, as David mentioned, people of lesser means could not get together and pool their resources to use for election-related messages unless they registered with the FEC and were subject to strict contribution limits. People often overlook what was actually at issue in the Citizens United case. This was a documentary that was produced by a conservative group, Citizens United. It was called Hillary: The Movie. They wanted to air it during the 2008 election season, and they were prohibited from doing so. Why? First of all, it mentioned a candidate for federal office. She was running for the Democratic presidential nomination at the time. And two, it made her look bad. Now, whatever you think about Hillary Clinton or about this particular movie about her, how can that possibly be consistent with a constitutional provision that says congressional shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech? The Supreme Court concluded that it could not. And it also concluded that the First Amendment made it -- forced it to override an earlier rule that said you cannot engage and express advocacy if you are a corporation or a union, meaning you explicitly were advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. You frequently hear a couple of arguments in response to this decision from people who didn't like it. First of all, they say, money is not speech. Well, that's literally true. But you do need money in order to get your message across to a mass audience. So I suppose Congress passed a law saying newspapers can exist, but they can't spend any money. Or newspapers can exist, but they can only spend up to this amount of money. Clearly, that would be abridging the freedom of the press. Similarly, if Congress said, you can spend as much as you want if you're a newspaper, but we're going to limit how much you can take in from advertisers and readers. So once you understand that this is really controlling -- money in effect is controlling speech, I think you also have to recognize that loosening these regulations on speech does not mean empowering people to buy elections. Why? Because the messages that you pay for still have to persuade voters. You're still talking about convincing people to vote a certain way. There are a number of striking illustrations from recent elections that show you that money can't buy you love. And I'll just give you a couple of them. One from 2010, Linda McMahan is trying again this year. She spent $46 million of her own money on a Senate campaign in Connecticut. It was nearly a hundred dollars for every vote she received. She lost by 12 points. This year, Jeff Lake won the Republican nomination for the Senate in Arizona. Even though he was outspent two to one, he won by 48 points. So clearly, money is not the whole story. It is, nevertheless, true that in general, the people who win tend to spend more. But it's also true that stronger candidates tend to attract more money. Well, what makes a candidate strong? There are various characteristics that you can imagine that would make people both better able to raise money and better able to get votes, charisma, popular policy positions, but one of the most important is incumbency. And incumbency gives people tremendous advantages in terms of visibility, the power to dispense pork, name recognition, and the reelection rates for members of Congress are insanely high. I mean, historically, in the past few cycles, 90 percent or more even in the last -- in the 2010, when Democrats lost a bunch of seats, it was still about 85 percent. So incumbents have this huge advantage and they use campaign finance regulations to reinforce that advantage. One great example is the so-called Millionaires Amendment, which was part of McCain-Feingold Act. It said that if you face an opponent who is spending his own money, he's financing his own campaign, then we're going to lift the limits on the contributions you can get. So this is clearly designed to help out incumbents who are facing self financed challengers. Another argument you often hear is that corporations are not people. Well, that's also literally true, but corporations are created by people. I mean, they're not created by robots or dolphins or extraterrestrials. I mean, they're created to achieve certain goals. The question in Citizens United was whether people lose the right to freedom of speech when they organize themselves as corporations. I think people tend to think when you hear the word corporation of these huge businesses like Wal-Mart or Exxon Mobile, but, you know, every one of us works for a corporation. This debate tonight is sponsored by a corporation. The groups that are complaining that corporations have too much influence over politics are themselves corporations, right? So you have to understand that corporations overwhelmingly consist of small businesses and nonprofits, not these huge businesses. And they represent all sorts of points of view and take on all sorts of issues. Our moderator, by the way, works for a corporation, Walt Disney Company, correct? And he had this privilege before Citizens United that most corporations did not, they were allowed to talk about politics on the air even if it meant mentioning a candidate for federal office. Now, that was an exemption, a media exemption for media corporations, that journalists took for granted, but it's very hard to justify under the First Amendment because when you talk about the freedom of the press you're not talking about the freedom of members of professional news organizations, you're talking about the freedom to use technologies of mass communication. That's a freedom that we all have that's guaranteed to all of us by the First Amendment. So by lifting the restrictions on the money that people could collect and spend on political messages, these two decisions, Citizens United and SpeechNow, signal that freedom of speech is not a privilege that's reserved to billionaires or to media corporations or to politicians, it's a right that belongs to all of us no matter how we choose to organize ourselves. And I think we're seeing benefits from that in terms of diversity of voices and greater competition in elections that we can talk about later. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you. I can see that we're going to have a lot to talk about tonight, but my partner, Trevor Potter, laid out the case for why in response to the First Amendment we still have an important interest in mitigating the corruption that can result from even independent political activity but from in particular from contributions to candidates. I'm going to take us on a closer look at the proposition, itself, Two cheers for super PACs, and suggest that we don't even have the rules that super PACs were premised on. Mr. Keating laid out a very rosy picture of what super PACs are, but that doesn't really resemble what they are in fact. After 40 years of Supreme Court intervention, what we have is more loophole than law. Let's start with the issue of independence. As my partner mentioned, the Supreme Court has repeatedly said that speech that is independent of campaigns can't be corrupting, and, therefore, can't be restricted. Let's set aside for a moment how ridiculous that statement is, that if somebody showed up and said, I'm going to spend a billion dollars to support candidates who favor position X or position Y, that that's not going to have some influence on candidates or elected officials. We'll leave that aside for a moment and just look at what independent really means today because the rules around what independent is for super PACs are basically nonexistent. There are in effect only two rules that apply. One, candidates may not share inside information from what they're thinking and what their resources are with a super PAC, and the super PAC may not give a contribution directly to the campaign. Obviously, they can give lots of things of value indirectly, like spending lots of money on television. There are more rules about what Goldman Sachs' partners can say to each other than there are about what super PACs can say to candidates. We've all seen the jokes that this leads to. My partner's super PAC, Americans for a Better Tomorrow Tomorrow, has been referenced several times. It's one of the best pieces of political theater that has happened in the last 24 months. I would strongly suggest, if you haven't seen it, you go online and find it. It's really funny. But what we're seeing in that -- and they've provided a tremendous example -- is that there are, in effect, no lines between super PACs and candidates. Let's just give a couple of examples. Candidates can raise money for super PACs. They can show up at their fundraisers, and they can raise money, at least up to the $5,000 federal limit. But then what happens after they leave? Who knows? We all know, at least in the presidential election, the super PACs are being run by long-term aides of the candidates, in both instances. Candidates can endorse super PACs. You hear Mitt Romney talking about my super PAC. And just in the last couple of weeks, since we've watched the conventions, we heard about Karl Rove, who, of course, was senior advisor to President Bush and to many other Republicans, getting briefings about his super PAC around Tampa. And last week in Charlotte, Rahm Emmanuel, who had been, at one time, White House chief of staff, and was the honorary chairman of the Obama campaign, left that position and the next day was giving interviews on the floor of the convention about how he was now tapped to be the lead fundraiser for the Obama-aligned super PAC. So, clearly, independence under the current rule is a joke. That, in effect, leaving aside what's happened in the super PAC, has undermined something we thought we had before. We thought we had contribution limits, again, as my partner described, for very good reason, to avoid the issues of political corruption that come with large contributions to candidates. Now, those rules still technically exist. You can still only give $2,500 to a candidate. You can only give $25,000, or whatever the limit is, to a party. But you can then turn around and give $25 million to a super PAC that's working, essentially, as a surrogate for the campaign. Though, let's remember that those $2,500 and $25,000 are irrelevant to most of the population anyway. It's only 1 percent of 1 percent of the population that's giving north of $10,000 a year to those entities. Well, now, with super PACs, we've seen that shrink even further. So 200 people account for 80 percent of the money that was raised for Super PACs, at least as of the last filing. Lastly, let's talk about transparency. It's true; super PACs do have to disclose their donors and their expenditures. Transparency is something that the Supreme Court speaks glowingly of in Citizens United and other cases. But there's a loophole that you can drive a billion dollars through, right? You don't have to give your political money to a super PAC. You can give your political money to a so-called social welfare organization, or corporations can give them to industry groups, and those can do almost exactly the same thing as super PACs can do, and they don't have to disclose their donors. So when people say, How much money is being spent in this election? the answer is, We actually don't really know. We know that it will be more than ever before, but we don't know exactly how much, and we don't know exactly where it's coming from. These are problems that can be addressed. We can have rules on transparency that address disclosure of all political spending that's related to the election. We can have rules, coherent rules, around independence that require that super PACs are at least an arm's length distance from the campaigns. We need a functioning enforcement agency, and I hope that we'll have a chance to talk a little bit about the dysfunction of the FCC later on. But none of this will make a difference without an alternative. A friend of mine likes to say that transparency alone is like the webcam that was at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico showing us the Deep Water Horizon well, right? Shows you everything that's spewing into the Gulf, but it doesn't do anything to fix it. We need an alternative. We need a system of citizen-funded elections that allow candidates to run for political office without dependence on large contributions and big donors. That's commonly known as public financing, but when you think about it as a system that is designed to change the incentives of candidates, then it becomes something slightly different. If you think about a system we have in New York where, if you're participating in the system, $175 contribution is matched six-to-one. What's the result? It's transformed the way that funds are raised for city offices here in New York. Instead of going to the Plaza or the Waldorf, you're going to people's living rooms and dining rooms talking to normal folks, constituents about what the interests of their community are. So if the premise of this debate had been money and politics is badly regulated, I would have happily switched sides and sat over there and argued that case. But the answer to the current lawlessness is better rules, not less of them. "

    "data":"Well ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great pleasure to be here with you, this is a fascinating topic at this particular moment in American history. And I would’ve thought maybe that people were tired of it by now but I can see that that is obviously not the case. Now as the chairman said, in fact I don’t think this— you can decide that question other than in the context of what it—whether or not you’re going to succeed, other than in the context of what American policy is and what the stated foreign policy of the President of the United States is with regard to this question. That’s— I had the fortune or misfortune to go to any number of Army service schools, one of them was the Army War College, where they taught me a lot about the strategy of planning… itself, you started with the mission, national purpose, you have a policy, and then you devise a strategy from that. then you implement that strategy. That’s how it works. Now, last March I listened carefully when President Obama announced that our policy in Afghanistan was to disrupt, destroy, and disorganize our enemies, our specific enemies who were a danger to the United States. That’s a nice… clear policy, you know, it’s not too hard to understand that. And to that end, General Stanley McChrystal was put in command out there, and sent out to make what is called a commander’s estimate of the situation. Which he did, with a lot of help from various people for several months and it is now as you know, the object of great contention in the Washington world. And the problem with his estimate, I think, that is causing so much trouble, is that it is normal in an estimate of that kind for a commander to propose several options to his superior, among which the boss can choose. To present only one option, in this case the option of a large-scale counterinsurgency campaign, across all of the really hostile parts of Afghanistan in the context of their ruined, if ever alive economy, and their obviously rather feeble political system, is a daunting task. But somehow it has become-- what we would call an implied task for General McChrystal, that the pacification of large parts of Afghanistan and the most hostile places are in fact a necessary thing. And for that reason, he has opted for counterinsurgency. Now, I am happy to see so many members of my generation out here in the audience. There are usually too many young people for my taste. But— I started in the counterinsurgency business —in the church of the counterinsurgents, really. In 1964, if you can believe that, when the Army sent me down to Fort Bragg to study this subject with intensity and at the feet of the most learned French and British exponents of this theory of warfare which had been created as a result of the experience of the former colonial powers in World War II in fighting against the wars of national liberation as they were called then. And the Communists had gotten involved in all these wars so we were against all this as well, so we studied up on this in a big way, and one of the most interesting of the guys who taught from the stage there was a great, a great scholar named Bernard Fall. Bernard Fall. Some of you undoubtedly know who that is. And I remember watching him, I— of course I had no real idea who he was at the time but I remember him, watching him write—write on a blackboard on the stage, “Counterinsurgency equals political reform plus economic development plus counter-guerilla operations.” “Counterinsurgency equals political reform plus economic development plus counter-guerilla operations.” And that’s really all of it right there, that’s all of it in a nutshell. And it is in that context that when you look at Afghanistan, this huge place that’s the size of Texas with 35 million people of very disparate origins, many of them speaking languages that are not mutually intelligible, and who don’t like each other, a lot of them, very much, in fact you can see, that this is a very difficult thing to do. We tried applying this theory of warfare, counterinsurgency, across the world in the 1960s and ‘70s and ‘80s and I did it myself in South America, in East Africa and Southwest Asia and all kinds of places, and of course Vietnam, how could I forget that. And we found that in places where the task wasn’t too big, you know, the country wasn’t too big, the problems weren’t manageable one way or another, or people weren’t thoroughly converted to some ideology that demanded revolution, that you could do this, by enough good works and suppression of guerillas you could turn this around, and I could name places if we had time. In places that were eerily big and where none of those conditions applied, we—you could struggle like the devil but you wouldn’t get very far, you know. And I—this is the problem I have with the idea of the application of counterinsurgency, those three things, to Afghanistan, I know that was four things. In fact, I think that is too big a task for us. We have been fighting for eight years, Afghanistan is a huge place, it has terrible problems, economic ones, political ones. And the combat problem, from the point of view of a guy who fought in several wars like this including Vietnam, is really very difficult And I would submit to you that if what we’re going to do as General McChrystal says, we’re going to try to protect the people, which means essentially, control the population because that’s what counterinsurgency is about, just like insurgency is about controlling the population either with positive means, or means not so positive, sometimes, you’re going to have to have a lotta troops to do this. I mean General McChrystal evidently wants 40,000 more people. Well I would say to you that that’s just the beginning. That’s how we started in Vietnam too. This is a big problem we’re facing in Afghanistan. And in fact, this slice of the pie will be followed by further slices of the pie. And my objection to all this is, and the reason why I don’t think we can win with a counterinsurgency strategy, is in fact because I think that, three or four years down the pike, if we apply that strategy, all you good people, and your fellow citizens across the country are going to look at this, going to say, are the Taliban, or whatever it is we’re calling the Taliban, are they really our enemies, in the sense that al-Qaeda was? Is this really what we want to do? And when that happens, I suspect that what’s going to happen is you’re going to tell your members of Congress that you’ve had enough of this, and then they will vote the end of the war as they did in Vietnam. So I don’t think we can do this, I don’t think we can do counterinsurgency in Afghanistan, there are other methods that could be applied, that would control the situation there over a long period of time, I don’t think we can withdraw altogether. But counterinsurgency in Afghanistan I find to be a very difficult idea. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Thank you. Thank you all very much, thanks for coming out, I’m very pleased to share the stage with my friend and colleague Steve Clemons. To give you a little taste of hallway life at New America Foundation, I notice a few of my friends and many of his friends but I’m trying to suppress my concern that this is going to turn out like an Afghan election. Um…  So the question before us is whether the United States can or will succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan and I thought the chairman said it well, this is obviously an elastic question that depends on your definition of success. So let me offer my own. That US policy contributes to the persistence of an Afghan government that is not forcibly ruled by the Taliban, and a Pakistan that does not completely fail as a state, or fall into the hands of Islamic extremists. Well by that definition, which captures the bare minimum of US interests at issue in the war, I think the answer is obvious, you can construct such a policy. Whether or not we will is another question I’m sure we’ll talk about, but we certainly can. There are two basic reasons, one is that there is still time to define our goals more modestly and allocate our resources more realistically. And the second is that the situation in Afghanistan and the surrounding region is not as dire as many of you may fear. So I want to concentrate my time now on the second argument because it’s the less familiar one. I hope there are some Afghans in the audience. They can tell you better than I that we as Americans diminish ourselves and—when we talk about Afghanistan as we too often do as a primitive land of savage tribes that has been at war for centuries. Afghanistan between the late 18th century and 1979 was a coherent and mainly peaceful independent state. Although very poor, after the 1920s it enjoyed a long period of continuous peace with its neighbors, secured by a multi-ethnic Afghan national army and unified by a national culture. That state and that culture were badly damaged, almost destroyed, by the wars ignited by the Soviet invasion of 1979, wars to which we in the United States contributed disruptively. Yet after 2001 Afghans returned to their country from refugee camps, and far-flung exile to reclaim their state. Not to invent a brand new western-designed democracy, but to reclaim their own peaceful decentralized, but nonetheless unified and even modernizing state. Despite the manifold errors of US policy during the Bush administration, a strong plurality of Afghans still want to finish that work. And they want the international community to stay, to correct its errors, and to help them reclaim their country. After three decades of continuous violence most Afghans are sick of war, and afraid of the Taliban’s return. We have an obligation and a national interest and we certainly have the capacity to stand by them. About three times as many Afghans today still have a more favorable view of international forces in their country than they do of the Taliban. Millions of Afghans risked their lives to vote in the recent Presidential election. American, international and Afghan government failures have certainly handed the Taliban momentum. But the Taliban are hardly unstoppable, or even as successful as many Americans today apparently believe. Today we regard Iraq for example as passively stable. Yet the per capita rate of violent death in Iraq today is four times greater than the similar rate in Afghanistan. At the peak of Iraq’s war it was 20 times greater. We’ve heard much anxiety about the allegations of fraud in the recent Presidential election and for good reason. Fractured politics, corruption and weak leadership present some of the most important challenges to US policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan alike. These challenges do argue for a new strategy that places much greater emphasis on political approaches, than on violent military action. But consider what has not happened since the Afghan Presidential vote. No opposition protesters have taken to the streets, not a single rock has been thrown through a single window. The opposition leader has spoken freely and offered pointed criticism of the sitting—sitting President, but he’s done so within the constitutional system. In Kenya a couple of years ago the incumbent President stole his reelection and the entire country burned down. The Afghan response to similar evidence of fraud has been entirely pragmatic. The great majority of Afghans continue to show they want security and normalcy, they’re willing to talk their way through this crisis, we should get ourselves organized and help them. Finally we can succeed at this course correction because we do not have to do it all ourselves. Our presence in Afghanistan is entirely legitimate, under international law the United States is—the United Nations is present, every government in the region other than Iran’s wants us to stay. Russia is supporting our supply lines, China wants a stable Afghanistan, India’s Prime Minister has announced his intention to seek a transformational peace with Pakistan. Some of our allies it’s true, including Russia and Pakistan, are sullen and ambivalent. But unlike in Vietnam or Iraq, this neighborhood is united in its desire for stability and security. And it’s united also in the conviction that American persistence in Afghanistan, corrected and recalibrate, is required. The ultimate exit strategy for the United States from South Asia is Pakistan’s success. This is not assured but the prospects are improving. Pakistani public opinion has now turned sharply against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The best way for the United States to support this momentum is to stay in Afghanistan, stabilize that country, marginalize the Taliban through population security and negotiations, and broaden and deepen its engagements in Pakistan. The best way to assure the failure of Pakistan on the other hand, a state with scores of nuclear weapons, would be to allow the Taliban to return to power in Afghanistan, or to conduct a narrow war of terrorism that takes no account of the aspirations or long-term security of the Afghan or Pakistani people. I’m astonished when I hear American leaders advocate a counterterrorism war that amounts to an indefinite campaign of remote-controlled assassinations by flying robots. This is hardly the face of America that we should be emphasizing. Our record in Afghanistan and Pakistan should humble all of us. It should bring humility to the way we define our goals and realism about the means that we—that are required to actually achieve them. It should lead us to choose political approaches over kinetic military ones, urban population security over provocative rural patrolling, and Afghan and Pakistani solutions over American blueprints. But it should not lead us to defeatism or to acquiescence in a violent Taliban takeover of either Afghanistan or Pakistan. We have the means to prevent that, and it is in our interest to do so. Thank you."

    "data":"Thanks— Thank you, while I have a chance to pay tribute to my boss and colleague, Steve Coll, on the blogging front, Steve writes the blog “Think Tank” for The New Yorker, you should go check it out, I hope Steve writes about this. Steve was commended the other day by Senator John McCain at a forum in Washington. John McCain said to everyone go read Ghost Wars, and as it turns out Barack Obama’s been carrying a text of Ghost Wars around for about 11 months. I think it’s the most carried-around book that Obama has had, if he would just finish it we might get somewhere. I also want to take a moment to pay tribute to Kati Marton who’s a member of our board of directors and happens to be married to one Richard Holbrooke. Richard Holbrooke is in my view one of the most tenacious and effective results-deliverers in the global justice community. I put myself somewhat in the realist community, but I don’t—I generally criticize some of the goals of the global justice community, for not being able to set priorities, not being able to set plans, not being able to pursue things to their end. And Richard Holbrooke does do this. My problem, and why I’m on this side of the aisle from my friend and colleague Steve Coll, is that very few people in the Obama administration are like Richard Holbrooke, or can frame the debate in Pakistan and Afghanistan like Steve Coll just did. And this concerns me. If you speak to people of responsibility within an administration, clarity of objectives and how you’re going to get there, the game plan, being not only able to explain to the American public why we’re doing something, but to be able to create internal plans that help you execute consistent direction is vital. And that clarity of direction has not been in place and it wasn’t until the leak of General McChrystal’s report, in my view, that you began to see higher prioritization of the Afghanistan question. That is a lousy way to tell the world that we’re under good management in the United States. A few years ago I was in China. I went to see the equivalent of the policy planning staff in China, said what are you folks working on. And they said how to keep you guys distracted in small Middle Eastern countries. And as we’ve moved from the problems in Iraq, we now have moved to a problem in South Asia, and very often we talk about as Steve Coll did, the drama that envelops the South Asian region, the very important promise the United States has in possibly trying to achieve a new equilibrium there. But let me ask you all a question, how many of you look at China, whether you’re concerned about its security forces or indebtedness, as a major issue for the United States, just raise your quick hand. Okay, how— hands down. How many of you look at in the Middle East, what is unfolding with Iran, Iran’s nuclear intentions, as a significant, really giant hurdle for the United States. How many of you look at Russia, some of you look at Russia and what’s been unfolding in NATO as a major issue. Probably a fewer number, but they’re out there. I am seeing lots and lots of hands go up, lots of concern. And let me tell you— The issue, the issue here today, is one, whether the United States after eight years of failing to move the needle, in fact seeing the needle come back on itself very dramatically, is convincing the world today that it can achieve the objectives it sets out for itself. I think Barack Obama has inherited one of the worst economic and national security portfolios of any President in American history. We are not starting out at the same starting point that George Bush was starting out. You’re starting out in major—in a major hole, in a major deficit. And how we conduct our primary goals and objectives, has huge consequence on the way our allies see us, and whether they depend on us or not, and it also has consequences on our foes and their behaviors, and I would argue today, that the equilibrium, the general equilibrium that the United States had around the world, has been broken, and the tectonics of global affairs have shifted around so dramatically, that as we find ourselves bogged down, into very large goals, which I think are commendable goals, but we’re not achieving them, we’re convincing Iran not to negotiate in a fair and honest way, we are convincing Russia to continue to move its objectives. We are convincing China, that we’re increasingly a basket case. We— China would have to finance this war. We’re paying $65 billion a year at current levels. And that’s before the add-ons, just in military terms in Afghanistan today. That does not include what our allies are spending militarily, nor does it include the nonmilitary expenditures. Ladies and gentlemen, that number is bigger than the entire GDP of Afghanistan. We could buy the whole place, we could put everyone to work. We could do a Marshall Plan in the region for something very different. My worry about a lot of the steps that we’ve taken in Afghanistan is that we’re finding ourselves increasingly in a civil war, in which the Pasthun opposition which is the home base for the Taliban, actually sees us increasingly as occupiers and controllers, and I worry about our inability to disentangle that. Now there are others who have written, and Les Gelb did so recently in a Daily Beast article, Les Gelb the former, well-respected head of the Council on Foreign Relations, said it’s time for the United States to find a way to turn this not just into a NATO war, and an American war, but an Afghan war with other stakeholders. Particularly countries like Russia and China and other stakeholders in the region where they can come in, and actually feel as if this matters to them too. That the instability there is happening, we are right now back into, while we have allies, back into a sense that this is our game. And we have some slightly reluctant fellow travelers from NATO helping us, and we’re achieving none of the big, progressive goals that I think that we should be able to. And so as we look at this, we look at the cost and we look at how we’re operating in Afghanistan, I think it’s very important to look at the consequences on US society and what it’s achieved elsewhere in the world. Jim Jones, President Obama’s national security advisor, just said, that we have succeeded in diminishing al-Qaeda’s resonance and its robustness, both in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and he said, that there is no imminent threat of a Taliban takeover. Now, this is quite different than General McChrystal’s report and I have to say, that General McChrystal has probably written in my personal view, one of the most stark and realistic and probably accurate assessments of the mess in Afghanistan today. I disagree with the prescription because I don’t have confidence and faith in the ability of the Presidential leadership to get this right. My colleagues on the other aisle, are going to argue that it can. But, at some point you have to pull the plug, and say that it is time that we begin to move in a different direction. We need a consistent voice, consistent leadership, that is not happening. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Thank you, it’s a great pleasure to be here tonight to argue about a subject that I think should concern us all and I’m very pleased that the American people are so closely engaged in this discussion that concerns the safety of the country, the safety of all of us, as well as the fates of many of my friends and I’m sure many of your sons and daughters and friends as well, so, it is well worth the time to invest in thinking hard about these questions and what it is we’re trying to accomplish in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Steve focused on why it is that we should succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and talked to a certain extent about why it is possible for us to do so, that the situation is not as dire as perhaps has been presented. It is my task then to talk about part of the way we can succeed, part of the how. And I’d like to start off if I can by pointing out that, there has been an acceptance so far in this debate of what it is we’re trying to accomplish, of what success means. And success has been defined as a pretty minimal standard. An Afghanistan and a Pakistan that are not ruled by terrorists, a Pakistan that still has security over its nuclear arsenal. I would contend, that if we cannot as a nation achieve that success, if it is impossible for the United States to ensure that Pakistan retains control of its nuclear weapons from terrorists…that that is a very, very dire situation. And that’s why we have invested so much as a nation to date, and why I believe we need to invest even more, because the stakes are so very high, the consequences of failure are potentially so catastrophic. That’s the bad news. The good news is that we can in fact succeed in this endeavor. And this book tells us how. This is the Counterinsurgency Field Manual written under the direction of General Petraeus and General Jim Mattis. For those of you who didn’t bring it along, I’m not going to read the whole thing. But to quote from Chapter 5… the way to conduct a counterinsurgency campaign is to do a number of different things, to do them all well, to coordinate them together. Our opponents say that it is impossible for the United States to help our friends and our allies do this, I would disagree, I would say that it is enormously difficult, but that we have a learning army, a learning State Department, we have adapted and we have developed the capability to do this reasonably well. We have a number of extraordinarily talented people, continuing to try to help our Afghan partners. And they do it by conducting combat operations against our enemies. This is a component of counterinsurgency, this is the counterterrorism part, killing or capturing identified enemies of the government of Pakistan, the government of Afghanistan, and that happens and that will continue to happen, and we are in fact, getting far better at that. Training and equipping host nation security forces is an essential part of a lasting counterinsurgency strategy, and it is essential for us not to have to conduct counterterrorism forever. So, if you want at some point the United States to be able to depart from Afghanistan, then you have to support raising and training Afghan security forces who in time, will be able to secure their country on their own, something we have not done very well to date. We have to provide essential services to the population, water, electricity, most of all security. We have to provide them with good governance, something that, we have not helped with as much as we should. We have to provide them with good economic development and opportunity to have their sons and their daughters earn a decent living, so that they cannot be attracted away by the insurgents, many of the insurgents I fought against in Iraq in 2003 and 2004, many of the Taliban insurgents today, are economic insurgents. That is, there is no other way for them to feed their families, than to take money from the Taliban, in order to conduct attacks against us, against the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan. So, for a very few dollars, well-invested, we can peel away the less committed parts of the insurgency, and we can provide them with an economic opportunity. We were able to do this in al-Anbar late in Iraq. The process started early but really came to fruition in late 2006, early 2007, and large numbers of the insurgents turned away from fighting against us, and started fighting on our side against al- Qaeda. We’ve done this before, the same people who made that process happen, who inspired that process in Iraq, are working now to do it in Afghanistan. So you can peel away insurgents and reduce the number of people you’re fighting, gain additional support for your effort. So we have done this successfully in the past, it is not easy by any means, but we have a track record. It is also important to note that Pakistan is now succeeding in its efforts. In March the Pakistani government decided because of extraordinary American pressure, to fight against the insurgents who had taken the Swat River Valley, just 60 miles from the capitol of Pakistan. And in a not very sophisticated but very effective counterinsurgency strategy, they cleared the Taliban out of the Swat River Valley, and the people of the Swat River are now returning home. Pakistan is about to do the same thing in south Waziristan. They are conducting an effective counterinsurgency campaign to relieve the danger to their government, and to make their weapons, and, and, and their country more safe. The most important thing we can do to help them in this effort, is to continue to conduct counterinsurgency on our side of the Durand line in Afghanistan. It will be enormously difficult for us to encourage Pakistan to continue conducting its counterinsurgency campaign, if we decide not to do so in Afghanistan. And the implications of that decision are enormously important. The single most important step we have to take, to build a secure Afghanistan and a secure region, is to raise and train an Afghan army that is sufficiently sized, and sufficiently well-equipped, to secure Afghanistan on its own. In my last job on active duty in the Army, I worked with Afghan soldiers, I trained Afghan soldiers. These are people who are willing to fight for their country. They are disappointed that we have not provided the resources to get enough of them to fight for their country, in order to enable us to begin to depart. Putting more effort into that, is the single most important step I believe, to helping America succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you. Looking out at this crowded house I’m really happy that I’m almost over my swine flu. Ladies and gentlemen. So far this evening, you’ve heard quite a range of opinions. Let’s look at the facts.We have been in Afghanistan for eight years. We have committed enormous amounts of treasure and quite a bit of blood. And eight years on, the Taliban have no trouble attracting volunteers…in fact their numbers are swelling. They are willing to take up primitive arms, and fight against the most powerful military in history, to stand with a Kalashnikov, or to attack a US outpost and stand and fight, despite the helicopters and the aircraft coming in on them, and killing them. And we can’t get the Afghan army to show up. Eight years. How much training does it take. Sophisticated weapons? What sophisticated weapons do the Taliban have. Bombs, rusty Kalashnikovs and grenade launchers. The Taliban are willing to give their lives for their cause. The Afghan army and police are not willing to die for the woefully corrupt and incompetent government of Hamid Karzai. That is simply a fact. Now my Army colleague John Nagl said, well, the Taliban are hiring, they’re economic soldiers. Ladies and gentlemen, you do not sign up to stand against the greatest army in history, and give your life, for the Afghan equivalent of a minimum wage. And we pay better than the Taliban. Why aren’t they lining up, to join the Afghan army and fight? Why do our soldiers and Marines have to go into battle alone? Or, worse, watching over their shoulder to see if the Afghans with them, are going to betray them or shoot them in the back, as has happened repeatedly. This matters. How many Americans should die for the government of Hamid Karzai? And we can—and Steve Coll said, well, you know, we’re going to fix that. When, how? Eight years. Ladies and gentlemen, we have the power to stay—and the wealth—to stay in Afghanistan forever. Certainly beyond our lifetimes, if we wish. But strategy is about asking what we get out of it. And is it doable, strategy isn’t about what’s nice to do, it would be nice to turn Afghanistan into Vermont. But it is not going to happen. Because, one thing we cannot do— we can fly in in our helicopters, dismount, arrive in an Afghan village and get the elders to nod their heads, until we leave. We can bribe them for a while, they won’t stay bribed. But we cannot make Afghans want what we want. A brief history. We’ve been in Afghanistan before. We had major development projects, in Helmand Province, down where they’re fighting now, in the 1950s and ‘60s. Nothing came of it. The Soviets, had at their peak 140,000 troops, tens of thousands civilian advisors. Their interagency process worked because they could order people from other departments to go. They have thousands of Dari and Pashtun speakers. They built hundreds of clinics and schools and factories, it’s not like just the bad Soviets killing people in the movies. Their Afghan army was over 300,000 trained with helicopters and tanks. And they lost. Because the people of Afghanistan didn’t want what the Soviets wanted them to want. Now think of this as an investment. We’re investing our blood and treasure. What is the possibility of a positive return, for that investment. For the past 200 years, every foreign investor has lost. Are we truly exceptions to history? Is it worth the gamble? Afghanistan is not a country, it is an accident of where other people’s borders to ended. You cannot nation-build where there is no nation to build. In a tribal society, you work with tribes. Now we may know that it would be wiser for all the tribes to get along. But we do not want what Afghans want. General McChrystal’s report is fascinating. In many respects it’s an objective view. But you know what it leaves out. Religion is barely mentioned. In the Counterinsurgency Manual, religion is barely mentioned. This is even more foolish than trying to deal with the war in Europe in World War II—and ignoring Nazis. Religion may be politically incorrect to talk about. It’s difficult, it makes us uneasy. But to write a 66-page report about the Taliban, and not mention the power of religion and fundamentalist Islam, seems to me that we are living in a dream world. Now. This debate--  Thank you. This debate, the terms of it make me uncomfortable. Because I’m in the middle. In a world of very strange bedfellows, I find myself aligning with Vice President Joe Biden, or, I’d like to think he’s aligning with me. But the choices aren’t all in or all out. There are rational choices. Ladies and gentlemen, why did we go to Afghanistan in 2001? Because of al-Qaeda. To punish them, to smash them, and to punish those who harbored them. Afghanistan was a low-budget terrorist motel. So the feds raid the motel, kill some of the bad guys, capture some, and others escape. And instead of going after the ones who escaped, we decided to renovate the motel. Now, I would just close by saying, I believe there is still a purpose in maintaining a compact, lethal force, focused on destroying our enemies, helping Pakistan to the extent Pakistan deserves the help, but not allowing ourselves to be blackmailed by the Pakistanis, as we have allowed ourselves to do. But at the end of the day, this is about flesh and blood, Afghans of course, and our young men and women in uniform. Now, I am not a pacifist. Wars have to be fought. But let us ensure that they are true wars of necessity, and not wars of inertia, and bad habits. Let’s—when we ask our young men and women in uniform to die…if they must die, let it be for sensible strategy, and attainable goals."

    "data":"To convince you on your second vote, to support this motion, I think the other team has to convince you of either one of two propositions. The first is, that we don’t have any serious interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and therefore we should walk away. Or, they have to convince that we do have interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but they’re too costly to achieve. And therefore, we should walk away. Although I just heard a new one from Steve Clemons who says, well, we may have interests, they may be costly but we can achieve them, but we should walk away perhaps because the President can’t make up his mind. I think that Steve and John together have made a very persuasive case, for the interests that we have—we have, in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. That these interests are not just America’s interests but these are shared by our allies. And that we have the capacity, through the intelligent application of counterinsurgency doctrine, to achieve those. And listen very closely to Ralph Peters’ argument, the smash them and leave argument, I believe, and to still vote for this proposition requires you to go through a kind of a contortion known as remote-control counterterrorism. Remote-control counterterrorism, that’s where, presumably, you track and you deter al-Qaeda from offshore, maybe with precision munitions, maybe from satellites, maybe like that. I think that’s a fundamentally flawed proposition, I would submit to you. And it’s flawed for a couple of reasons and let me share those with you. With some realistic talk about how you actually have to deal with al-Qaeda. Counterterrorism operations require two things, it requires intelligence, and it requires the ability to offensively strike against them. You need to know where they are, what they’re up to, and you need to be able to strike at them. There are only two sources of intelligence, if you’re tracking al-Qaeda folks up in the borderlands between Afghanistan and Pakistan. And I’ve spent a good deal of the last two years, in those two countries. One is by signals intelligence, where you try and track where they are by their cell phone. Even as texting New Yorkers have found out that cell phones can be dangerous to your health, the al-Qaeda guys have gradually stopped revealing themselves by the same notion, which leaves you, really, relying upon human intelligence. Spies, in other words. We don’t have a lot of spies on the border areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the intelligence that we get about al-Qaeda and their fellow travelers compassed from the intelligence networks run by the Afghans, and the networks run by the Pakistanis. If we walked away, why on earth would they share that intelligence with us. Let’s assume for the moment that you did have the intelligence about where a cell was who were planning another attack in New York or in a London subway. How do you strike at them. Right now the way we do it is with UAV Predators. They have a flight range of about 400 miles. It’s 600 miles from Waziristan to the Indian Ocean. Which leaves you the option maybe like the Clinton administration did in 1998, with launching a Cruise missile at them, but in the hours that it takes to target and launch a Cruise missile, the target’s probably gone, and worse, since it’s not accurate, you have a lot of collateral damage, a lot of dead civilians, and the cycle continues. Fundamentally, to protect this national interest, that I believe even the other team agrees, to protect ourselves from terrorism, we need access, and cooperation, in Pakistan and in Afghanistan. We don’t need Vermont. We don’t need to stabilize the whole country, you don’t even need to engage in counterinsurgency activities across the whole landscape. But you do need cooperation, you do need access, and this is about as stark a statement of national interest that I can think of. Thank you."

    "data":"If you need more time I’m afraid I can’t help you. I’d like to thank Bob Rosenkranz and Intelligence Squared. I feel like I’ve spent most of the past year watching Presidential debates, it’s nice to finally be in one. Please don’t change your minds, Bush was obviously the worst President of the past 50 years. Yet the task Simon and I have tonight is extremely difficult. We have to convince a small fraction of you, at least if you’re anything like the people who have given Bush the lowest approval rating of any post-war President, who still resist that conclusion. And to be honest I’m not sure that people who still defend the Bush Presidency are entirely open to persuasion. But I wanna try, by talking a little about how much Bush has done wrong and how little he’s done right. Let me first just tell you a little bit about my own perspective on this, I am not a Bush hater. I’m not someone who can be described as a partisan Democrat, the way Mr. Kristol and Mr. Rove are partisan Republicans. I’m a centrist liberal, I’m fairly hawkish on security issues, I’m in favor of limited government. And let me just state up front, I think George W. Bush was a fine governor of Texas. I think Ronald Reagan was a successful President, and I think George H. W. Bush, 41, understood foreign policy better than all but a few Presidents in the post-war era. About two years ago, I started writing a book about the Bush Presidency. And I was gonna spend a lot of time on Bush’s successes and accomplishments. And I’ll admit that I wanted to do that not just to be fair, but so I would look fair. And, I looked for the successes and accomplishments, and I looked, and I looked, and I came back totally empty-handed. There were a number of areas where I expected to stick up for Bush, but I really found it impossible. For example, I was sympathetic to his approach to education reform. But even from a conservative perspective, Bush didn’t allow— provide enough resources to allow for any real mobility or choice in public schools. Instead of national standards which we needed he let the states write their own tests. That’s what the conservative base wanted. They don’t believe the federal government should be involved in education at all, and in caving in to them Bush ensured that he’d make little meaningful progress on education and in fact, he has made very little meaningful progress. I thought Bush was right about the need for immigration reform. And then I watched him surrender to the xenophobes and nativists in his own party. I thought Bush was right to spend a lot of money fighting AIDS in Africa. And then I watched him save far fewer lives than he might have, because of religious extremists, again in his own party, who believe abstinence propaganda’s more effective than condoms. I thought Bush was right about free trade, and then I watched his lack of leadership lead to the collapse of the most important item on the global trade agenda, the Doha development route. So, those are the partial successes. I can’t hope to cover all Bush’s failures tonight. What would be a top failure for a President doesn’t even really make his top five. So, never mind his incompetent response to Hurricane Katrina, it doesn’t make the cut. Never mind his denial of climate change and eight lost years on global warming, that doesn’t make the cut either. I’m just going to give you my top five. Number one is the invasion of Iraq. This was the most important decision of the Bush Presidency and he made it on the basis, as I think we all know, of the false premise that Saddam Hussein was threatening America with weapons of mass destruction, and consorting with al-Qaeda. Now I’m not someone who believes that Bush deliberately falsified the evidence. But I believe he was totally uninterested in the evidence. This war would never have been fought, if Bush had been interested in the truth as opposed to finding a pretext for something he wanted to do. I think his second biggest failure is the mismanaged occupation of Iraq. Bush refused for more than three years to change a failed military strategy. And almost the whole time people like my friend Mr. Kristol here were desperately insisting, rightly in my view, that Bush needed to move to a counterinsurgency strategy. Bush said, essentially, don’t bother me with the details. He delegated the strategy to Rumsfeld and he ignored the failure. I think the surge has helped tremendously in Iraq, the outrage is that Bush moved to it in 2007, not in 2003 or 2004. His third biggest failure is undermining Constitutional rights, and American ideals. Now I can’t go into detail here about all the ways he abused his authority, and disregarded the rights of both foreigners and American citizens. But he and Vice President Cheney opened the door to torture, which led directly to the horrors of Abu Ghraib. He effectively suspended habeas corpus, holding suspects for years without charge or trail, and he took a perverse view of his office, claiming that virtually limitless executive authority was part of the inherent power of the Presidency. His fourth failure was sabotaging American unity after September 11th. The day after the attacks, the front page of La Monde in Paris said “We are all Americans.” The whole world was with us. But Mr. Bush and Mr. Rove saw September 11th as a political opportunity for what Spiro Agnew called, “positive polarization.” Now Simon is gonna speak to the harm, that this did to America’s image in the world. But I would just say, with a new administration coming into office, never in more than 200 years of our history has restoring America’s around the world been such an urgent project for a new President. Number five, my last, is Bush’s catastrophic economic mismanagement, which is so current we hardly even need to spell it out. It remains to be seen whether we’re facing a depression, whether Bush will stand in for Herbert Hoover. But I think it’s clear that we’re living through the direct result of an ideological refusal to sensibly regulate financial markets. Bush says he’s sorry about all the lost jobs, if you saw his interview on ABC last night. But, as he loses his, the interesting question is whether he ever understood, or understood now, his own contribution. Now our opponents this evening, may try to argue that Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter was worse. But neither of those Presidents failed as badly as Bush. Carter had the Camp David agreement, and despite Watergate, Nixon left historic accomplishments including opening relations with China, and creating the Environmental Protection Agency. Neither of them rivals Bush for sheer, all-pervading incompetence. But if our opponents tonight. Thank you. I’m closing here, if our opponents tonight wish to argue that Bush was only the second worst President of the last 50 years, that’s not much of a defense. This national nightmare, I would suggest, has been the deepest and longest of all."

    "data":"Well, thanks, John, I’m still happy to argue that and it’s the truth— It’s good to be back on the Upper West Side, let me say I grew up just a mile from here, Bella Abzug was my Congresswoman. And that made me a conservative. Right.  A decision I’ve not regretted, since then. Bush was not my first choice, George W. Bush was not my first choice for the Republican nomination for the Presidency in 2000, I’ve had my quarrels with the Bush administration, but he’s been a pretty good President. He’s, it’s—Well…As we sit here safely, seven years after 9-11, having won a war in Iraq, we can snicker and laugh with the US economy having grown 18 percent over the last eight years, faster than any other Western advanced country, with the prescription drug benefits having been passed that has benefited many seniors which Bush gets no credit at all which he took on his own party for, on issues like immigration he valiantly took on his own party and did an awful lot to try to get that through. Bush has actually been a pretty impressive President, it’s unfortunate that the public has, for various reasons, some of them good, soured on Bush, and he’s done a horrible job, his administration, of explaining what they’ve done and what the choices were. In the real world the choices are not, you know, perfection, and a pretty good Presidency, in the real world he’s made a lot of tough decisions, most of them correct. When he became President al- Qaeda was ascendant, Saddam Hussein was contained but unsustainably so, unless you think we could’ve had sanctions and inspectors for the last eight years. North Korea and Iran were secretly working on nuclear weapons programs, A. Q. Khan was dispensing nuclear material and know-how all over the world, Pakistan had exploded a nuclear weapon, in 1998. Then, 9-11, Bush reacted to that correctly, basically. We have been protected here since then, we have al-Qaeda on the run internationally. People can talk all they want about—there are a couple of things he did that he shouldn’t have done, these have been— they were fixed by people in his own administration. Jack Goldsmith, Attorney General Ashcroft, Attorney General Mukasey, have fixed some of the mistakes that were made under the pressure of trying to defend this country against a ruthless terrorist group that had taken 3,000 lives, history will look kindly on Bush’s performance as a national security and homeland security President. And one piece of the proof is that Obama is not going to change much. As the Obama people get briefed on the threats, they see that the surveillance program is necessary. I suppose Obama will close Guantanamo and move, in effect, Guantanamo here to the United States and put the people at Fort Leavenworth but he’s not going to release these people into the US. Enhanced interrogation techniques which McCain and Obama oppose, so I guess I’m a lonely person in defending those, saved an awful lot of lives when used on Khalid Sheik Mohammed and I’m not willing to second-guess the decision, to use those techniques. Bush was a strong President on national security, the decision to go into Iraq was necessary I think. The Middle East today, with Saddam in power, or his sons in power, with terror connections, redeveloping the weapons of mass destruction programs presumably, since I don’t think we could’ve kept sanctions on, and inspectors in for eight years, would’ve been a much more dangerous place. The decision to go with the surge was a courageous decision, made in December 2006, January 2007 under great adverse pressure, with very little public support, very little support from the Republican establishment, no support, obviously from almost any Democrats except Joe Lieberman. It was the right decision, it’s been utterly vindicated. Have we ever seen really, this kind of real-time test. Bush said let’s do this, here’s what will happen, here’s how we’ll work, these critics said it can’t work, it wasn’t working, you’re crazy, more lives are gonna be thrown away, and we had a real-time test of who was right and who was wrong. And now Barack Obama of course being an intelligent person, admits that the surge worked, and we are now beginning to draw down in a position of success in Iraq, not leaving a country that would’ve been a breeding ground for terror, I mean the degree to which Bush does not get enough credit, for refusing to cut and run in 2007 in Iraq, the degree to which people don’t appreciate the strategic, the geostrategic disaster that would’ve been, remains kind of amazing to me. We have a pretty good outcome in Iraq, a very important ally in the Middle East, that has sacrificed a lot in fighting terror groups, that is standing with us against Iran, that has signed just a Status of Forces agreement with us, that will be a strategic partner with us. In a way this could be a strategic victory that could be the flipside of the strategic defeat that the Iranian revolution in 1979, was. The rest of Bush’s foreign policy has been…I have my quarrels with some of it, but most of it’s been pretty successful, the relationship with India, the management of the China and Japan relationships. The Europeans have been annoyed at Bush at various times, on the other hand we’re working more closely with Europe on Iran than we ever have before, and for all the talk about the US image in the world, the truth is, Barack Obama’s not going to change those policies much at all. And I think it’s good as an America, if we get a lot of credit now with Obama and people decide they like us better but the actual policies, the NATO policies, the Afghanistan policies, the Iran policies, the Pakistan-India policies, the China policies, are not going to change much. Because they’re sensible pollicies. On the economy, obviously that’s been terrible in the last few months, I do think Bush could’ve done some things differently but to be fair, it’s not as if the Democrats had one prescription and Bush had another, and we went down one road and that’s where we are. There were bipartisan mistakes, on some of the institutions like Fannie and Freddie. I’d say Bush was more correct than the Democrats, on others, he might’ve been somewhat less correct. We did have economic growth over these eight years, on the other hand, the big piece of deregulation that everyone loves to site as being the kind of key that unlocked the derivatives and the other instruments that have turned out to be, that spiraled out of control, the key that unlocked that was presumably the 1999 deregulation of financial institutions signed by Bill Clinton. Bush didn’t sign any big deregulatory bill. So he gets a bit of a bum rap on the economy but, I won’t, I won’t make that my leading argument, for why Bush was a successful President, but the prescription drug benefit has worked very well. It has preserved competition while coming in under budget and helped a lot of seniors, aid for Africa has worked well, Bush has fought for free trade against a Democratic Party that has tried to turn its back on free trade and would…hopefully Obama will follow Bush and not some of his fellow Democrats in that way. The proof is in the pudding. Obama is not going to change many Bush policies. So it’s a little ridiculous to say, Bush is the worst President in 50 years, Barack Obama’s an intelligent, impressive man. He promises change, I hope he brings some change. But the fact of the matter is, Obama’s Presidency will be in most major respects, a continuation of the Bush Presidency, and that’s a good thing for the country."

The only thing I think that might make you, or many of you at least, not agree that George Bush is the worst American President of 50 years, is to hear somebody say it in a British accent. I’m acutely aware of the sensitivity of international comment. I am a deep skeptic about my own government, and I will not say much good of Gordon Brown, I won’t say a lot of good about hereditary monarchy. But if I hear someone with an American accent insult my Queen I’ll hit them. There is something about foreign accents on these subjects, that gets people’s backs up, so I beg your pardon. The point I want to make is this. That there are really two American Presidents. There’s a President of the United States of America, and that is entirely your business. But there’s a second American President. And he is the President of the Western Alliance, and in many senses since the end of the Cold War, is seen as a sort of President of the rest of the world. I’ve just been in Syria and Lebanon. A lady speaking at a meeting made a rather moving remark. She said every single one of us round the world, went to the polls on November the 4th, but only some of us were let in. The vast majority disenfranchised, sat outside, while America decided on their economy, on their diplomacy, on their politics, in many cases on their lives. And it’s to that American President that I want to say a few words tonight. I’ve spent almost all my life cheerleading for America. I’m second to nobody in this noble cause. And I can tell you it’s not been easy this past eight years. But until the last eight years, I have always felt, that each American President, in some small sense, pushed uphill the great boulder of democratic freedom. Every single one, I felt at the end of it, yeah, America’s done it again. We’ve made a bit of progress. I felt that was one of the great strengths of America, that it could push that boulder a bit uphill. It may have been a military intervention, it may have been a trade agreement, may have been a single example. Whatever it was, somehow or other, there was progress forward with what I call the great American crusade. When George Bush came to power I was rather in favor of him. I rather admired the program he put forth with this foreign policy. Condoleezza Rice’s famous article on a humble foreign policy, definitely appealed to me. I liked the remark about America setting the world an example by what it did at home, rather than by getting the 82nd Airborne to lead kids to school. This seemed to me to be a refreshing, unbombastic, unostentatious diplomacy. Then came 9-11. And I’ve always remembered those few weeks after 9-11, when the whole world was pro-American. Yasir Arafat gave blood for New Yorkers. Many people forget that. Almost nobody, almost nobody, was not on America’s side for those two or three weeks. And the disaster that followed, going to war in…true retaliation for it, is something from which I don’t think American policy has ever recovered. I’ve recently been touring around that arc of instability, and the consequences of the consequences of 9-11 really have been catastrophic. To pretend that Iraq is a success is obscene. Iraq today is more or less back to what it was like in 2004 and if Karl or Bill want to walk hand in hand with me down Haifa Street in Baghdad, as you could still in 2004, well, I can tell you they won’t. Afghanistan is heading in exactly the same direction, I think Afghanistan’s going to be a far worse mistake than Iraq. But in every single theater that you look, with the possible exception of Japan which had been eccentrically mentioned, you will see what I can only describe as the wrong decisions taken. Iran should not be a at the moment, it should much more like Egypt, and it could’ve been. There’s no reason for undermining the Pakistan government to the extent it has been undermined by American military intervention there. Russia, a putative friend eight years ago, is now a serious menace. Wherever you look, you see what I call the crashes down the road of neoconservatism, littering the highway of world affairs. This was unnecessary, it was not required by circumstance, it was choice, it was decisions made in Washington. Now those of us who feel very strongly about America, always regarded the basis on which America operated out of its area, America went abroad to do things, was that it had a sort of moral superiority. There was behind what it did, a backbone. And that backbone was the backbone on which those people who approved of American intervention abroad always relied on. I’m afraid under the leadership of the last eight years, that backbone has snapped. It has been simply impossible to tell countries elsewhere in the world that the American example, that the American intention, that the American execution of its intervention has been for the best. People just don’t see it that way. If you go round many of these countries today, and I mean today, you see the most extraordinary faith put in the next American President—If you go round the world today, you will find the most extraordinary faith in the person you’ve elected as your next President. I have never come across anything like it. A totally naïve belief, that this is the messiah, Barack Obama, has come to save not you, but everybody. He will solve the Middle East. He will get out of Iraq, he’ll get out of Afghanistan, he’ll pacify Pakistan, he’ll make friends with Iran. Ludicrous expectations are placed on the shoulders of this man. The reason why that’s happened is because people simply have despaired over the last eight years. The reason why, I think, unrealistic but possibly disastrous expectations are made of Barack Obama, is that, George Bush, for better or for worse, George Bush, has caused such a catastrophe in so many countries around the world. I congratulate you on voting for Obama, I hope you will vote for this motion, thank you."

    "data":"Thank you, John. Thanks to Intelligence Squared for having me here tonight. Simon, I know what you mean about the problem with foreign accents. And I noticed it didn't take you all long to vote, did it. I'm going to make an appeal to the open minded people of the upper west side. And for those of you sensitive to sulfur and brimstone, I apologize, nothing I can do about it. I’d like to spend my time talking about the drive-by’s we just saw. Let’s start with education. We say a drive-by on No Child Left Behind. Sure, we said states should set standards. We didn't set one national standard, because we wanted the people in New York and the people in New Mexico to be engaged in setting standards for their states, and to be involved in setting up a system that they would buy into. And in the five years since No Child Left Behind has come into force around this country, which requires every state to set standards, and to test every child grades three through eight to find out if the children are meeting the standards for reading, writing, and other material, we have seen more improvement in reading and math and science scores in those five years than we’ve seen in the twenty-eight previous years combined. And the scores have gone up most… The scores have gone up most among minority communities, black and brown and poor and rural. We heard about immigration, with a, a line that said, somehow or other the President threw in with the immigration restrictions. You know what, I don’t think that bill we brought to the floor of the United States Senate was an immigration restrictions bill. It was a bill that resolved the problem in a comprehensive way, and the President showed courage by standing for it and making it possible. PEPFAR. I heard a dismissal of this incredible effort, by the generosity of the American people, that is today providing over two million people in Africa with life saving retroviral drugs. Now sure, we insist upon encouraging programs to have to educate people about abstinence and faithfulness within marriage, and how those can help break the cycle of the spread of AIDS. And it’s working. And free trade, I love this one, I love this one. I sat there and was part of the team that bled to win trade promotion authority, and you know how many votes we won it by? One. We got CAFTA, which was a no-brainer, should have been a no brainer. You know how many votes we got it by? One. I sat there in that room, in the cabinet room with twenty-two Democrats who voted for NAFTA, and China, and TPA under Clinton, who could not bring themselves to vote for free trade under this President. Why? Politics. So, I appreciate the enthusiasm that some of our adversaries here at tonight’s debate have for free trade, and I'm looking forward to working with them in common cause on behalf of every free trade measure that comes before the United States Congress. And why don’t we make a pact that we’ll start with Columbia? Why don’t we do that. Now, about that invasion of Iraq, I appreciated hearing about how it was done on a false premise, and hearing those words come from the mouth of somebody who wrote eloquently about the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power, I appreciate your support at the time. Nice of you to flip flop now. Easy to flip flop now. Look, do we wish we had the, that the weapons were there? And it was justified under those terms? Yeah. You know what? You know what, though? Smart people, like Bill Clinton and Al Gore and John Kerry and our new Secretary of State designate sat on the floor of the Congress or at the White House in the nineties, or in the Congress in the 2000’s and said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. And we now know that there was a reason why he didn't have them, but he wanted us to think he had them. He told his interrogators he felt it made him look big in the neighborhood, and he, and we know from two reports by, by Kay and Duefler, that Saddam Hussein was intent upon recreating these programs the moment the West lost its interest in him. So he literally siphoned tens of millions of dollars out of the Food for Peace Program to do two things, to keep together the engineers and the scientists and the technicians to reconstitute these programs, and to keep the dual use facilities to rapidly reconstitute particularly the chemical and biological programs. Now, I loved also being lectured about sabotaging unity after 9/11. I sat there in those meetings on Homeland Security, where we had a great consensus about the need to defend the homeland by reorganizing our government, and the Democrats insisted on one thing, that the Department of Homeland Security should not be subject to the same constrictors regarding union membership that John F. Kennedy put in place for the rest of the government in 1961, and that Jimmy Carter signed into law in 1979. They wanted the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Transportation to be governed by strictures that said, in a time of national security, certain elements of the agency could be declared off limits for union organizing, but they didn't want that same rule to apply to one department in the government, The Department of Homeland Security. Because they saw it as a sop for their union allies. That was not national unity in the aftermath of 9/11, and it was an absence of national unity, because there were Democrats in the Congress who never accepted the legitimacy of this President. Talk about the mismanagement of the economy. Let’s talk about it. The Dow down thirty-eight percent, the NASDAQ down seventy-eight percent. The S&P down fifty percent. Six trillion dollars lost in value in one year. I'm not talking about today, I'm talking about March 2000, when the markets started to go down and bottomed out in October of 2002. Thank God this President had the wherewithal and the political capital and the moxie to pass a large effective stimulus package of one point six trillion dollars over ten years that got the economy growing again by long lasting tax cuts that benefited everybody in America who pays taxes. Even the critic Ray Fair at Yale, who forecast that in 2000 his model said George Bush would get thirty-four percent of the vote, he was just a little bit off, said that without this one out of every twenty American workers who were employed in 2001 and 2002 would not have been employed were it not for the tax cuts. Now, we’ve heard some other things, Fannie, and we’ve heard about Yassir Arafat, giving blood in the aftermath of 9/11. Well, as long as America wasn’t going to throw over Israel as our ally and friend, that was going to be a temporary act of friendship, and an enduring life of hate. And Iran, it’s somehow our fault, Bush’s fault, that the Ayatollah’s, and the Mullah’s, and the lunatics are pursuing a nuclear weapon in Iran? I think that has to do with their decision to pursue a nuclear weapon, not us making them do it. And Pakistan? I loved it, being lectured about undermining the government of Pakistan. After all, haven't we just elected a President who promised to invade Pakistan if it didn't comply with America’s wishes? Now look, I will defend the President, and I will defend the record of the last eight years. Not always successful, but enormously successful over the long term and the long sweep of history."

    "data":"Well, thank you very much, I appreciate Mr. Rosenkranz putting this on and it’s an honor to be invited here and the introduction was overly generous. But guns cause bad things to happen and makes—and guns make it easier for bad things to happen. But guns also make it easier for people to protect themselves and prevent bad things from happening. Guns make it easier for you to harm somebody, but guns also make it easier for you to deter criminals from attacking to begin with, and turn out to be the most effective way for somebody to go and defend themselves when they’re having to face a criminal by themselves. It’d be great if police were there all the time, my research finds that police are probably the single most important factor for reducing crime. But I think one thing the police understand themselves is they virtually always arrive on the crime scenes after the crime’s occurred. And the question you have to ask is what do you advise someone having to do, when they’re having to confront a criminal by themselves? Even if they’re able to call 911, you know, fast response times are measured in eight or nine or 10 minutes. And that can be a lifetime for many people. I think, as Mr. Rosenkranz was mentioning to begin with, a lot of people have a pretty good idea of the bad things that happen with guns. He mentioned the number of suicides. But you also have, if you look at surveys done by the Justice Department you’ll find maybe about 400-450,000 crimes are committed each year with guns. By contrast, you have similar types of surveys that indicate that people use guns defensively about 2 million times a year. So about four to five times more frequently people use guns to stop crimes than guns are used in the commission of crime. And yet, I assume for exactly the reasons why Mr. Rosenkranz mentioned earlier, people are if anything like to guess the opposite. I mean if you have—if you’re the editor of a newspaper and you have two crimes that you’re talking about, one, there’s a dead body on the ground, sympathetic person like a victim, and another case where a woman’s brandished a gun, the would-be criminals run away, no shots are fired, no dead body on the ground, it’s pretty obvious which story’s gonna be considered much more newsworthy. Now, we all want to try to take guns away from criminals. I mean one thing that’s been tried many times is to go and have gun bans. The problem is that when you go and pass something like that, the question you have to ask yourself many times is who’s most likely to obey the rule. If it turns out that it’s the most law-abiding citizens who obey the rule and turn in their guns, relative to the criminals, you can actually see increases in violent crime. And Washington D.C. is one important example of that. In 1976, September of ’76, D.C. passed a ban banning handguns, it didn’t go into effect until February, uh, ’77. Uh, but only once after ’76 was D.C.’s murder rate as low as it was in ’76. Only twice in two years after that was D.C.’s robbery rate as low as it was in ’76. And D.C.’s crime rate not only went up relative to what it was in the past, D.C.’s crime rate went up relative to neighboring states, it went up compared to the United States as a whole, it went up relative to other large cities. Here’s a graph that shows you for the top 50 cities of the United States, in 1976, D.C. was about 18 percentage points higher than the other 49 cities in the top 50. You can see after that, it keeps on going up, and if I were to have it in ’88, it even soars dramatically past that, but you can see, it’s about 90 percent higher when you get to 1987, the rate was falling before the ban, relative to other cities and rising dramatically afterward. It’s not just D.C. though. In Chicago, Chicago’s murder and robbery rates were falling prior to the 1982 ban, and they rose afterwards, they rose relative to other cities. One other way I can just mention for D.C. here, D.C. was 15th of the top…50 cities prior to the ban. In half the years after the ban, it was either number one or number two, and it was number four another four years, so two-thirds of the time after the ban, it was one of the top four cities. It was nowhere even close to that prior to the ban going into effect. It’s just not in the United States. Worldwide, time after time—and it’d be interesting to have people try to show an example where this isn’t true—when you pass bans you see increases in violent crime rates. The UK, here’s an illustration from The Economist a few years ago. They’d banned handguns in January ’97. Robbery rates, armed robbery rates were falling up until the time the ban went into effect, and they rose afterwards, if you’d continue this graph they’d continue to go up. You’ve had a 340 percent increase since the ban went into effect and the rate at which people are harmed by guns. You look at Ireland, Jamaica— I mean one thing is, people go and say well the reason why the Chicago and D.C. bans didn’t work is because it’s so easy to go and get access to guns in other places. Well here you have ideal situations, you have island nations, where it’s relatively easy and go and enforce the borders and protect them. And yet they’ve seen huge increases in the numbers of illegal guns, because essentially all of them are illegal after these bans go into effect. And yet just as we see here in the UK if you look at Ireland or Jamaica or other places, you see time after time increases in robbery and murder rates and violent crimes. Now one thing people often do is they look across countries and they say well, look, England has a relatively low gun ownership rate, it has a relatively high murder rate even if their violent crime rate is twice what we are in the United States. And they may point to Japan or Germany or other countries, and they say the United States has more guns, more violent crime. But the thing they have to take into account is these other countries had much, much lower violent crime rates prior to bans going into effect. In 1900 for example in England, in London, a city of millions of people, with no gun regulations, you had two gun murders, and five armed gun robberies that took place. And, what you see time after time when these bans go into effect, either violent crime rates no longer drop, or they begin to start to go up, as you’ve seen in England and other countries. Probably one of the most controversial things we could talk about are gun-free zones that we have in the United States for things like schools or other places. And we hear about these things, they, they dominate the news. But yet one fact doesn’t go out, you cannot find one of these multiple-victim shootings in the United States that occur, that takes place in—where more than three people are killed, that doesn’t take place in a gun-free zone where civilians are banned from owning guns. You want to make places safer. Banning guns you think are the easy solution to that. But again if you pass a ban and it’s the law-abiding good citizens who obey the ban and not the criminals, rather than making it safe for the would-be victims you may unintentionally make it safe for the criminals who are intent on trying to harm others and make less for them to worry about, thank you."

    "data":"Thank you, John, thank you. Well, it’s a pleasure to be here with you, I was worried that they wouldn’t bring that story out and I wanted to make sure that I did full disclosure and… ‘course I also appreciate the Seattle-like weather during the last couple days. Let me give you a perspective from a police chief’s point of view. First of all you have to understand that the position of police chief is not, whether it’s Ray Kelly, the great police commissioner in New York City, myself or others, we all actually worked our way up through the ranks. A puff of white smoke didn’t emanate from City Hall and suddenly we became anointed with these positions. All of us worked as police officers and detectives and sergeants, et cetera, so we kind of understand some of the nitty-gritty, although the television shows here in New York are so much better.The right to—in Seattle we’d have latte stories or something. But the right to own and possess a gun in this country isn’t a debatable issue and it’s not the topic. Reasonableness though, and common sense do come into play. I’m not a researcher and I am certainly not going to play a researcher for this debate tonight, but I do want to cite a couple things because it provides a framework for you, but it also puts into my perspective 36 years of law enforcement experience. This is work done by Phil Cook. So the rates of assault, robbery and rape will not noticeably be affected by more guns. Increase in the secondary market of guns, will occur. What is it in the secondary market? Loans to and from family members of firearms, off-the-book sales, meaning that there was no background check. Thefts of guns which, it was mentioned, I am personally familiar with. The percent of suicide with guns is highly correlated with the prevalence of gun ownership, and the murder rate in large counties is closely linked to gun prevalence. An increase in the gun murder rate would be expected, but there was no effect on the non-gun murder rate. So you’re going hear from the other side about the deterrence effect, and in fact John already brought a little bit about that up. More people carrying more guns will deter criminals. In other words the criminals will think twice before confronting a potential victim. I wish criminals were that smart. On the other hand I’m glad that they’re not that smart, because that’s why we catch so many of them all the time. Since we have almost, in the neighborhood of 240 million guns in the United States, I would think that these criminals would already get the message that there are a lot of guns out there and that if deterrence was in fact carried through that we would’ve seen it by now, but we haven’t. The other side of this coin is, will more armed citizens have an opposite effect on criminals. In other words, are the criminals going to now arm themselves thinking that more and more and more people are carrying guns. Well, the union that represents the British bobbies, who have been unarmed since Sir Robert Peel founded them, their union went forward and said look, we do not want to be armed as bobbies in the UK. Now this was during a time of significant increases in crime, increases in knife crime which is still going on. But they asked not to be armed. Now there are some specialized units certainly, called armed response cars, et cetera. But for the vast majority of the bobbies in all of the UK they are not armed and they don’t want to be because, one, they think it will only increase assaults on themselves, and that it will be a tit-for-tat or a proliferation of guns in the UK. Which like rabies they have very few of. Who is carrying a gun now in this country in the United States, well of course law enforcement officers, state, federal, local. And, security guards, security guards across all walks of life from banks to armored-car services, literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people that are already carrying guns. And then there’s a whole ‘nother group of people, and those are the people that are able to go into their states, and ask for a concealed firearms permit. There is a background check, it depends on the state, on what’s done. But essentially they say look, I sell jewelry or I have a business that’s been robbed, or, you know what, I want to be able to carry a gun like in Florida. And they’ll be able to carry a firearm as a concealed firearm. Here’s the big unknown, here’s where research has not actually answered this question. All of these hundreds of thousands of cops out there and security guards and citizens who have concealed firearms permits, how many are actually carrying a gun? They may have the permits, they may have the authority. When you’re a new police officer, you’re usually armed to the teeth, and within a few days or months or years or whatever, you oftentimes don’t carry a gun. It used to be that you were required in police departments across the country to be armed whenever you were out and about, off-duty or on. Very few departments have those rules anymore. Because the gun is difficult to conceal, it is uncomfortable and it is difficult to secure. So when we think of all the people that are actually out there, how many are actually armed. We don’t know. Now whenever somebody gives you a simple solution to a complex problem, we all know that you can be assured of one thing, it’s wrong. And so after all of the different campus shootings that we have talked about and read about, just recently of course in Arkansas, we hear this hue and cry, well, the students should be armed, or the students and the faculty should be armed. And the outcome as one academic told me, there is one sure outcome of arming the college students and that would be grade inflation. The last thing that I’ll mention—let me close with this. When I was a young officer, working the street in St. Petersburg--retired people, a lot of them from New York in fact-- a young woman, 15 years old, intoxicated, beating and beating and beating on the front door of an elderly couple who had no phone. They became more and more and more afraid, but she had been there beating on the door. He turned to the thing that he felt could protect him the most, even though she was unable of course to get in, and she was just really an intoxicated kid beating on the front door. He fired through the door and struck her. A girl about the age that his granddaughter could or would have been. And I remember going to the hospital and seeing her there, and I remember the family that lived, that husband and wife in St. Petersburg for many, many years. There are lots of cases in which these guns could protect you, there are far more cases in which the gun does not. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you, John. Thank you. It’s a real pleasure to be here, I think one of the remarks that Gil just made, shows the difference between our country and England, historically, not just today. Our country was founded when the British government had a policy of colonialism in which it sought to exploit the Americans, to tax them without representation, and when the Americans protested there was an escalation, and the British sought to disarm the Americans that led to violence, because the Americans thought this is our only chance to protect ourselves. When you look at a debate topic like this, “Guns reduce crime,” for and against, let’s define our terms a little bit, guns possessed by who. Guns possessed by law-abiding citizens reduce crime but not guns possessed by criminals, and, what does crime mean, we look at the term crime I think in a—we should look at it in a very broad way. Crime means the unjust aggression against life, liberty, and property, of another person. So crime can be committed...singly by one person against another or, in small groups by a gang of criminals against another. Or at the highest level it can be committed by governments. When we look at the problem of genocide, the problem of crimes against humanity, these are major crimes involving large populations frequently in which guns are used unjustly and there’s an ability to do that on behalf of authoritarian or police states because the population is disarmed. So, when we look at this issue we should look at not just here and now, what happens in the United States, or what’s happened in the last decade or two, or what happens today, but look at it historically in terms of what sorts of societies have existed historically and which ones have balance and democracy and republicanism and which ones are the kinds of states that you don’t wanna live in, Nazi Germany, Uganda under Idi Amin or Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, I mean—this is real. We live in a society that’s very nice right now, it’s not guaranteed that it’ll always be that way, either, in terms of your own personal life or in terms of the possibility that a government could turn bad. What I think we’re advocating tonight, those of us on the side of the proposition, is that you should have freedom of choice to protect yourself if you decide to do that. One of the questions that was asked recently in the US Supreme Court, the District of Columbia was trying to defend its handgun ban and they said that it’s okay to ban handguns and that all guns should have trigger locks and be disassembled and never loaded. And one of the Supreme Court justices asked the question, well what if you hear the door crash in and you’re fumbling for your reading glasses and trying to turn on the lamp and your hands are trembling…maybe it would be a good idea to have a gun available if something like that happened so, the question is not whether everybody should have a gun, but the question is should you have the ability to exercise that freedom of choice if you are a responsible citizen, and that’s your decision to do so. Our American Revolution proved the ability of an armed populace basically to defeat a tyranny and that’s why we ended up in our Bill of Rights with the right of the people to keep and bear arms, the declaration that it shall not be infringed, and also a declaration in favor of a militia because that enhanced the security of a free state, security means that a free state is preserved as a viable political entity, it has republican institutions and people themselves are able to dissuade tyranny, they’re able to fight individual criminals. It was always considered to be a responsibility of individuals to, in the ancient hue and cry and the watch and ward, to, if criminals were on the loose, to try to catch them. And now we have degenerated somewhat into a society, where you don’t help anybody, and we have many instances where criminals are attacking people and nobody basically gives a damn. So…basically it comes back to freedom of choice, I’d like to use a couple of maybe legal cases, to illustrate the point. You’ve heard D.C. became the murder capitol of the United States after it enacted a handgun ban. There’s no duty of the police to protect you, it’s not just impossible for them to do so, it’s not a legal duty. Right before the handgun ban in D.C. was enacted, there were three women who were in a boarding house, and they were broken into. And there were two individuals who, over a period of many, many hours, raped and robbed and otherwise assaulted them. They called 911 several times, and the police would come knock on the door and nobody would respond. The police would drive by the house, because these ladies made repeated calls to 911. And so this ordeal, this nightmare finally ended, and they sued the DC government. And the courts ruled that there is no duty of government to protect any individual person. They have a duty to society at large, which is just kind of a useless concept when you're an individual and you're a crime victim. So there’s no duty to protect you. And then the question becomes, well, maybe you would like to protect yourself. Maybe you would like to at least have the legal right to do that. And that’s what the second amendment is partly intended to guarantee. That’s what the Supreme Court just held in DC versus Heller that we do have an individual right to keep and bear arms. And it’s a right. It’s not something you have to do. It’s not a duty. But it’s something that you can do. I represented a group of litigants in a companion case, and they live in the ghetto in DC, they're victims of robberies, house break-ins. This happened repeatedly. And they were good citizens, and they simply wanted access to guns. The same thing could be illustrated in Hurricane Katrina where the police chief announced no law abiding citizen could have guns, and basically they, the police themselves disarmed individual citizens. And we see the result of that. But if you went across the river into Algiers, the community known as Algiers, citizens armed themselves, they provided their own arms, and they kept violence down, they kept looting down. The same thing happened in the LA riots, and the same thing happened in Hurricane Andrew in Florida. There was no police protection, no national guard protection for several days. Armed citizens came forward and basically made sure that there was no looting, and no robberies, and no murders proceeding. So, the bottom line is, we don’t have the same system as England. You didn't hear Gil announce that the Seattle police force should disarm themselves. To the contrary, we should have armed police forces, and we should have that right to be exercised by individual citizens. Thank you."

Quickly, on the DC handgun ban issue, keep in mind that it was a DC handgun ban. You could still have a shotgun in your home. So if you needed to be protected in your home… The only thing that they were trying to take away was handguns, because those are the guns most preferred by criminals. But, if you look at the numbers that John had put up, which was interesting, if he had actually showed you the number of murders in DC, they had actually dropped. He showed you the rate. And what was interesting about that was, DC was de-populating tremendously in the seventies, and it was largely the flight of the affluent. So, the group that had the lowest likelihood of engaging in crime. So, crime was going to be, if you used the rates that John showed, it was going to be trending up, because the people remaining in the city had a much, much higher risk of crime. And so, when you make those adjustments, the conclusions are opposite to what John suggested. If you went for a number of years you’d see there was a huge run up in crime in DC, as there was in Chicago, and Philadelphia, and New York for that matter. But it had nothing to do with the topic we’re talking about. That was crack cocaine, which had a tremendous criminogenic influence on crime. The final thing to mention about DC handgun ban, is whatever it says about that particular experience, remember, DC is right across from Virginia, where there are plenty of guns. So, the story that John tries to tell you may tell you something about gun control in that urban environment, but it’s not a story about the value of guns. Everyone concedes that guns in the hands of the right person at the right time can reduce crime. That's why, as we heard, armed police and security guards are a good thing. If you go to a maximum security prison, the prison guards don’t have guns, because there are times when guns are good, and there are times when guns are bad. Prison guards, you might think, would want to have guns, but they know those guns would be taken away in a heartbeat by the criminals who are behind bars, so therefore you don’t see it. If you could expand the population in a cautious way to those who are unquestionably law abiding, and a cautious population, sure, there can be benefits there. But, the idea that, John Lott, and you will hear Gary Kleck argue that guns are being used constantly to thwart, um, criminals by these guntoting citizens is grotesquely misleading. John gave a number, two million. Gary Kleck has at times said there are two point five million defensive uses of handguns each year. It’s a complete fantasy because gun ownership is so prevalent in this country, criminals know that all they have to do is wait for the family to leave and go to work, or to school, and then they can just walk in and grab the guns. And that happens five hundred thousand to a million times per year. So by virtue of our prevalence of guns, we are giving great aid and comfort to the criminal population, because they can walk in, take those guns. There was a wonderful Sixty Minutes documentary a number of years ago designed to show you how you could protect your house from a burglar. And they had an active burglar showing how quickly he could get in the house. And when he got in, Mike Wallace asked him, well, what’s the first thing you do when you get in the house? And he said, look for the guns. They're gold to criminals, and that’s why they go in and get them. So, whatever benefit we get from scaring off, or even shooting a small number of criminals, it’s offset by the fact that five times as many guns will be handed over to a criminal, in effect, because the criminals will be taking that gun from the previously law-abiding citizen. Now, John and I have debated on the issue of right to carry laws, laws that say citizens who have not yet been convicted of a felony, or not yet been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital should be allowed to carry a gun wherever they want. John thinks this is a great idea, offers statistics to prove it. Let me just mention that in Texas, even if you have been committed to a mental hospital, if you can get a note from your doctor, they’ll give you that concealed handgun permit. North Dakota really set a new low. They actually gave one of these permits to a blind permit holder. This is, to be frank, insanity. Now, I published a number of econometric studies, and virtually every top econometrician who has looked at this has sided with me, and not with John Lott. The National Academy of Sciences convened a panel of talented experts who spent two years looking at John Lott’s work, Gary Kleck’s work. They came before the committee, testified, fifteen to one in that panel of sixteen, they concluded the scientific evidence does not support the more guns, less crime proposition. The lone dissenter was someone who was not an econometrician, who admitted in his dissent that he wished he knew more econometrics, and who had previously testified as an expert witness on behalf of the NRA. The other fifteen members of the committee responded to his dissent saying, quote, the scientific evidence does not support his position. Let me just note what the NRA tries to tell you about all sorts of things. This is a picture of something that you can buy on the NRA web site. It’s a picture showing the Second Amendment. And note the way they drape the gun across the page. It’s obscuring the first half of the Second Amendment which starts off saying “A well regulated militia.” That’s because they would try to have you believe that was not part of the Constitution, the idea of regulation being very central, because it’s the first phrase in the Constitutional Amendment that they're talking about. Now, if the NRA can't be trusted to tell you the truth on something that’s been on black and white paper for two hundred years, how likely is it that they're going to be able to tell you the truth on the complicated issues of evaluating what he impact of these laws are. It’s a complete absurdity to think you're going to get the true story from the NRA and their close allies. Thank you."

    "data":"And yes, I'm going to vote for Barack Obama too. Thank you, John, and thank you all for coming out on this very nasty night. That is indeed an accurate rendition of my background. The moral of that particular story is, I didn't come to this pro side of this debate via my ideology. It’s the most unnatural thing in the world, from that standpoint. I didn't come to that position by virtue of my social background. I grew up in the wilds of suburbia, basically, where guns are scarce. They don’t have guns to commit crimes, they don’t have guns to defend against crimes, they don’t have guns for hunting, they don’t have guns. My way into this position is basically evidence-based. I'm boringly scholarly. I’ve been studying this issue for nearly thirty years, I’ve written three books, dozens of articles. I’ve published more articles on the effects of defensive use of guns than anyone else. Oddly enough, sometimes what you can learn from a debate is by listening to the silences, paying attention to what people would be expected to talk about, but don’t. Strictly speaking, the other side actually hasn’t addressed the issue of the effectiveness of defensive gun use. They’ve kind of danced around it, but they haven't actually addressed it head on, and in fact, the organization Paul Helmke represents, the Brady Campaign, previously Handgun Control Incorporated, used to have a very prominent segment of their web site devoted to the proposition that, no, if you try to use a gun for self-protection, you're going to get yourself killed, or injured, or it’s going to be taken away and used against you. And they’ve more or less stopped talking about it, they're just silent on the issue. That's significant. The reason is, the evidence is unanimous, it’s rare in criminological research for the findings to be unanimous on anything, but they're unanimous on this one. Defensive gun use is effective in the sense that crime victims who use guns during a crime are less likely to be injured or killed, and less likely to lose property than crime victims who adopt any other kind of strategy, including non-resistance. Non-resistance is not the safest course of action. And this is so despite the fact that usually when people try to use guns for self-protection, they're doing it under tougher circumstances. They do it not because they're quick on the trigger, but because they're facing really desperate circumstances, they're likely to be outnumbered, they're likelier to be facing offenders with weapons, including guns, than other victims. They're more likely than other victims to have already been injured. And out of desperation, with all of these handicaps against them, then they use guns in an attempt to defend themselves, and from that point on they are not hurt. Much of the research that previously claimed that, if you tried to use a gun you’d only get hurt, it had a simple error in the research that everybody here can understand. It was an error in terms of what happened first. Researchers would report that there were many incidents in which people were injured, and they used guns defensively. What they didn't know, and it turned out once the error was corrected in the research, those were always cases where somebody was first injured, and then used the gun for self protection. It wasn’t using the gun that got them hurt, it was getting hurt that finally pushed them into using the gun. When they fixed that flaw in the research, they basically found that once people used guns for self protection, they are almost never injured after that point. There’s good reason why the chief’s police officers carry guns. They're effective for self protection, but it doesn't require the unique training and experience of police officers for it to be effective. It’s effective basically for everybody. You may not have noticed, but there’s actually more consensus among the six of us than might be evident at first. I don’t think anybody really disputes the proposition that the effects of guns depends on who has them. I haven't heard anybody on the other side say that guns in the hands of non-criminals are just as bad in the hands of criminals. It makes a huge difference. Basically, guns in the hands of non-criminals, or in the hands of victims, regardless of any prior criminal behavior, reduce violence. They reduce it in the sense that, once the gun is introduced by the victim, the offender stops aggressing. Period. Furthermore, defensive gun use is extremely common, contrary to Professor Donohue’s claims, it’s not sheer fantasy that leads us to believe that there are on the order of two million defensive gun uses a year. It’s simply probability sampling surveys of the same sort that Gallop and Harris and every major survey organization uses. You just ask people questions. You're not going to hear about these defensive gun uses from your newspaper, nor are the police going to hear about them because frankly, if you had been a crime victim who used a gun for self protection in a typical situation, you’d be insane to report it to the police. And of course if the police don’t hear about it, neither will your local newspapers. At best, maybe you’d be arrested for unlawful possession of a firearm, because most of these uses occur in public places where you're not supposed to have a gun, unless you have a special carry permit. At worst what can happen is you can be arrested for the, the assault itself, a criminal assault. It may well be somewhere down the road, after you’ve gone through a legal nightmare, that you're cleared of these charges, but in the meanwhile you can be bankrupted from the legal expenses, and have your reputation ruined, and nobody reads it on page eighteen that, oh yeah, you know, Joe Smith was cleared of those charges. So you're not going to hear about it from police statistics, yet scientifically conducted, objectively conducted surveys have, in at least twenty consecutive surveys, found that defensive gun use is not just common, it’s more common than criminal use is. And so that’s not a fantasy, as Professor Donohue would have you believe, it’s about as firmly established a fact as we have to go on in this area. Thank you very much."

    "data":"It’s great to be here tonight. I'm, just for the record, I was Mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana, not Indianapolis, but another great city in the state of Indiana. I came to this issue as a mayor. Not only had I had the experience, when I was a teenager, of seeing a friend get a bullet in the back because of the all too common incident of, we found a gun, we didn't know it was loaded, which happens every day in this country. But as a mayor, I saw what happens in a community when there are so many guns, and when we make it so easy for dangerous people to get guns. I had police officers, one case I still remember well, I got the call in the middle of the night from the police chief, our labor relations director, a police chief, married to a police officer, they kept a gun at their headboard. They wanted to be safe. They knew how to use the gun. They were police officers. They had a fight, domestic quarrel. She ended up dead. That happens a lot in this country. Actually, the statistics show that if you’ve got a gun in your home, it’s twenty-two times more likely to be used against you or a family member than to protect you. Think about that again. Twenty-two times more likely. And part of the reason is that the world doesn't easily divide into the good guys and bad guys, because there’s always sort of a chance that any of us can get angry, any of us can get drunk, and if the gun is there, what’s going to happen with that gun? When you look at the arguments for the proponents here, basically they talk about these two million defensive uses, and as Professor Donohue said, that’s a questionable number. Yes, it was based on probability sampling. There were sixty-six people who responded to a poll that said they used a gun defensively. Sixty-six, and then you extrapolate that by the adult population of the US, and you get two million gun uses. Just sixty-six. When you do sampling and have such a small affirmative number, and then you multiply it by huge things, you get these outrageous things. Based on that, more people have been in flying saucers in this country. It shows what happens with statistics. Actually, when I was running for Mayor of Fort Wayne, I learned quickly how statistics--how it works. I was running against an incumbent. I looked at what had happened in crime in my community, and there had been times when crime went up. And so I'm digging out the statistics. The police chief at one time said, yes, crime was up because the economy was down. People lost their jobs, they were going to commit crimes. Then I found another clip from two years later, he said, well, crime is up because the economy is good, more people have things to steal. You can take statistics and do whatever you want with them so many times. The one statistic that doesn't lie are deaths. You have to do probability sampling for these other things, but when you look at deaths, you get the shocking statistics. That thirty-two people are killed with guns, murdered with guns every day in this country. That’s a Virginia Tech happening every day in this country. Thirty thousand people die from guns every year. That includes the suicides and the accidents. You get the situation like just a couple days ago in Massachusetts, some kid is shooting a machine gun at some gun show, and he kills himself because he can't hold it. What is going wrong with this country? Thirty thousand deaths. And then when you combine the seventy thousand people that are injured every year, people like Jim Brady, who, by the way, was with President Reagan at the time, surrounded by people with guns, the Secret Service. That didn't stop them from getting shot. Those guns didn't reduce that crime. The other argument that the proponents seem to make, is they're holding up this straw man of the gun bans, and how gun bans don’t work. And you can argue the statistics. Actually, after DC had their hand gun ban, gun suicides went down twenty-three percent, gun homicides went down twenty-five percent when you looked at a ten year period. So, there’s a lot of statistics there. But the real issue is not gun bans. We're not talking about gun bans, we’re talking about the question, do more guns reduce crime? And it’s clear that the more guns you get out there, the more likely those guns are going to be stolen. Where do you think the criminals get these guns? That these guns are going to be trafficked. Where do you think the criminals get these guns? Misused? Where do you think accidents happen from? Used in road rage. Used in the domestic violence situation. It’s the guns that add to the problem. Other countries in the world have the same level, generally, of rapes, and of burglaries, and of robberies, and of assaults that we do, industrialized countries. But we are far and away the most deadly country when it comes to gun crime, because we have so many guns. In fact, if you think about it for a second, if the proposition were true that guns reduce crime, we should be the safest country in the world, and we’re not. And it’s because we do have so many guns, and those guns too easily get in the wrong hands. And actually, when you think about this proposition, rather than voting to say that guns reduce crime, you should stop and think that really restricting access to guns is what would reduce crime. We’re coming up on the fifteen year anniversary of the Brady Bill. The Brady Bill said, instead of taking an individual’s word whether they're a felon or mentally dangerous, let’s do a background check. The Brady--you know, bright idea, right? Don’t just say, are you a felon? No, of course not. You know, it’s a… The Brady Background check system has stopped one point six million people from buying guns who weren't allowed to buy guns. We had a situation just last week in Virginia where somebody went in to buy a gun, turns out there’s a murder warrant for them in Baltimore, and the person got arrested. You know, criminals, like the chief said, aren't always the brightest people in the world. In fact, this guy tried to argue, well, I didn't commit the murder, I wouldn't have gone and bought a gun if I… It didn't make any sense. Brady background checks work. If we decide that some people are probably more prone to violence, again, people with a felony record, people that are dangerously mentally ill, let’s stop them from buying those guns, let’s use background checks, let’s have them in all sales, not just from federally licensed dealers. Let’s do things to stop gun trafficking. Do you realize that you can go in and buy eightyone of the same make and model of a gun tomorrow, and what do you think is going to happen when someone did that in Charlie Brown’s Gun Store in Dayton, Ohio a few years back, eighty-one of the same make and model? They sell them out of the trunk of their car. People don’t realize how weak our gun laws are in this country. We basically allow almost anyone to get any kind of a gun. Last thing I wanted to comment on is the Supreme Court case. The Supreme Court case, while making it clear that gun bans are off the table, made it clear that we can have reasonable restrictions, that we can restrict who gets the guns, where they take the guns, how the guns are sold, how the guns are stored, and what, and all the things that deal with guns. That’s where this debate should come down. I'm not anti-gun. I’ve got my NRA pro-marksmanship badge from when I was in sixth grade. My friends all went hunting and did these things too. But once you see how easy we make it for dangerous people to get guns, you’ll conclude that you should vote against the proposition. Thank you."

    "data":"Now, I did this once before, and the competitive juices got going, and I turned into an insufferable jerk attacking the other side. So before I do that, I want to just express my love and admiration for my opponents. We came into this business together, Laura, the slowly aging portrait of Ralph that he keeps in his attic, and I -- And just complete admiration for them, the fact that they -- the Democrats have hired them to burrow within the Republican Party and to destroy it from within, I do not hold against you. Now, I admit I was on the left at one point. In the '60s, my parents took me to a be in where hippies would go just to be. And to demonstrate their liberation from money and material things, they threw their wallets into a garbage can. I was five. I saw a five dollar bill on fire in the garbage can. I ran into the fire, grabbed the money and ran away. And that was my first step over to the right in my life. Kept going. But we had one other influence in my family, which was my grandfather and his father, immigrants, lower east side, a Jewish kid trying to make it in the city. We had the attitude, the think Yiddish act British attitude, We'll fit in. We had the dream of making it in the city which meant making it in this neighborhood where we're standing, in the upper west side, the Upper East Side. And that was the -- how the Republican Party was started. It was started by Abraham Lincoln, a poor boy in Illinois who wanted to make it. And he did it when he was in the state legislature, using government to give poor boys and girls the power to make it and achieve social mobility. He created it by creating a state bank to invest, building canals and railroads. He got to the presidency, created railroad legislation, Homestead Act, Land-Grant College Act, even introduced the income tax. It was using government to give poor boys and girls a chance to succeed. And that was still around when I got there, when I got to Washington. Ronald Reagan, a much more pragmatic and flexible person than is now portrayed by many people on the right, it was about using government in limited but energetic ways to give poor people a chance to succeed. Reagan did it. Is the Republican Party doing it now? I think they have not because they've been so hostile to government. Ronald Reagan was more pragmatic than the current Republican Party. It's also no longer 1980. Now if you want to rise and succeed, it's not enough just to work hard and row a boat across the Ohio River like Lincoln. Think of a poor girl who wants to be like Lincoln today. She can't just work hard ferrying people across that river. She grows up probably without a father. She grows up in a chaotic community with low social trust, high economic pressure, few community bonds. To succeed, she's probably going to need some language instruction. She's probably going to need some early -- some protection from early childhood distresses that'll destroy her self-control. She's going to need institutions that'll help her build relationships so she can use people as tools for learning throughout life. She's probably going to have to spend 21 years in education to qualify for a middle class job. And so what does the Republican Party today have to say to her? Almost nothing. This party is encased in a simplistic and archaic metric, government versus the market. Government bad, the market good. If you're an energy executive or chemical executive, maybe the government is your central pain. If you're that little girl, the government is not your big problem. If you're that little girl, the government, through Pell grants is sometimes the solution at helping you work hard and becoming a better capitalist. Does the Republican Party offer anything? No, which is why Asian Americans, for example, voted against the Republican Party three times to one. The Republican Party has become so hostile to government that they find it very hard to have anything positive to offer. So hostile to government they can't really stand for social mobility, the cause they started with. And so this is a party that has lost the essence of having a positive agenda even in the cause that was its founding principle. And the country knows that. Republicans have lost five out of the last six popular votes in the elections. They've lost the Senate. They should have won. They held onto the House by force of redistricting. The Republican party has a 33 percent overall approval rating when the Democrats have 47 percent. You take every rising group in America. The Republican Party is losing that group. Latinos, by 4 to 1. Asian Americans, by 3 to 1. African Americans, by 9 to 1. People in single households by 2 to 1. They're getting slaughtered among young people. If this electorate, and the electorate of the 20th century, was made up of 85-year-old men -- white men, the party would be doing awesome. This party is not that party. This party sometimes looks like the receding roar of a white America that's never coming back and has to move to recapture that. It has -- and what is the people's top criticism of the Republican Party? Recent Gallup poll this week, the top criticism is they do not compromise. So this is a party going down the drain. It's a party that's unwilling to compromise on budgets, unwilling to compromise on guns, apparently unwilling to compromise on immigration. Bob Bennett of Utah, a very conservative guy, thrown out of the Senate for working with a Democrat. I had lunch with the fourth most conservative member of the Senate -- terrified of getting primaried from the right. Unwilling to have any flexibility. Becoming an uncompromising party. To me, this is a party that has to tackle two big issues. The first issue is the welfare state, which is making us unsustainable. The second issue is that little girl and the social immobility, the social segmentation that Charles Murray writes about. And my advice to the Republican Party: don't move to the center for the sake of moving to the center. The center is nothing. Move to the center for the sake of that little girl, which is your founding principle, which is social mobility. Do right by that little girl and you'll do right by yourself politically. And that means having a positive agenda. It means being more flexible. It means being prudent and sensible, not a party of a red rump of America. And so, I don't necessarily want to call the party to the center just for centrism. But I want to call them back to their essence as a party. And so, I ask you to vote for the proposition. Thank you.

    "data":"Thank you very much. It's great to be here on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, or as I like to refer to it, my mission field. I feel a little bit more at home since I got to walk past Lincoln Center. Makes me feel a little more at home to know that a Republican president has something named after him in this part of town. And you know, it's good to be here with Mickey Edwards and David Brooks, who was often referred to in Republican ranks as “Obama's favorite conservative.” And I'm looking forward to a very lively and spirited debate. You know, I think for those of us who grew up in this party -- and I knocked on doors and walked precincts in my first campaign for a Republican candidate, 35 years ago -- we've seen this movie before. Virtually everything that David just said from that podium would have been said in 1949 after Dewey lost. It would have been said in 1965 after Barry Goldwater lost. It was said in 1977 after Ford lost. It's been said every time the Republicans lose a major election. And I would just say, paraphrasing Mark Twain, “When it comes to the Republican Party, the premature reports of its death are greatly exaggerated.” And in fact, I would argue that in spite of a personal defeat for the party's presidential nominee, that in fact, if you look across the board, in spite of the polls that David cited, the Republican Party is institutionally and demographically stronger than it's been in decades. And if you don't believe me, I'll walk you through the statistics. First of all, look where the Republican Party was after Hoover and the Depression: 36 in the Senate, 117 in the House. Look where they were after Nixon and Watergate, after those devastating defeats following scandal and humiliation and national failure. And the party's brand then was even lower than it is now. 36 in the Senate, 144 in the House. Even after George H.W. Bush, after his defeat by Bill Clinton, the worst defeat, by the way, for an incumbent president since Hoover in 1932. The Republicans at that point stood at 44 in the Senate and only 166 in the House. You compare that to today where they have 30 governors compared to the Democrats' 20, and there's no question that the Republican governors, whether it's Nikki Haley in South Carolina. or Scott Walker in Wisconsin, or Bobby Jindal in Louisiana, or Chris Christie in New Jersey are among the most popular reformist conservative forward looking governors in the country, reforming education, reforming public sector unions, balancing budgets without raising taxes. The same policies that we're being told are repudiated and dead, and can't be sold anymore, are more popular than ever at the state level. And the truth of the matter is that that's not just at the gubernatorial level. The Republicans elected over 700 state legislators in 2010. They controlled both Houses of 24 legislatures to only 13 for the Democrats. So I tell you what the Democrats are going to find out. They're going to find out that second terms of two-term presidents aren't a lot of fun. For Eisenhower, it was the recession, Sputnik, and a heart attack. For Nixon, it was Watergate and Vietnam. For Clinton, it was impeachment. For Reagan, it was the loss of the Senate, and ideological control of the House in '86, and Iran Contra. And, of course, George W. Bush, Katrina, and Iraq. Second terms aren't a lot of fun, and there's only been one president in the post-World War II period who won House seats in his second off year election as a two-term president, and that was Bill Clinton in 1998. So just keep that in mind when you listen to all these premature obituaries. I'll quote you one from 1993. This was by the then outgoing RNC chairman, and he said, We should not cling to zealotry masquerading as principle and stale ideas of a dead and dying past. Sixteen months later, the Republicans gained control of the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years. My second point would be we've tried this before. This formula's been applied. If you don't believe me, go to California, a state that once produced Nixon, Reagan, [unintelligible], and other great conservatives. They moved to the mushy middle. They nominated candidates for statewide office that were pro-choice, pro-gay rights, and fiscally moderate. And today it is fair to say that the Republican Party stands on the verge of extinction, having followed these same policies that are being recommended now. Only 25 out of 80 in the California assembly are Republicans, only 11 of 40 in the state Senate, following this same playbook that's now being recommended nationally. And the other thing I would remind you is this is not going to be a freebie. If the Republican Party walks away from core conservative convictions -- remember that 27 percent of the electorate is self-identified evangelical Christian, 10 percent are frequently mass-attending, pro-life, pro-family Catholics. They voted 75 to 25 percent for Mitt Romney. That constituency is larger than the African-American vote, the Hispanic vote, and the Union vote combined. And if this party retreats from those core conservative principles, those folks will stay home or support a third party, and then the Republican Party will become the Whig Party. One last thing because I'm running out of time. I'm an old high school and collegiate debater. Defining terms really matters, and we're in a debate. And remember what this resolution says. It says the Republican Party must seize the center, that is to say become a party that splits the difference between where it is now and where the Democrats are, basically become a Democrat light, or it will die. It doesn't say, lose elections.” It doesn't say, under perform among minorities. It says, it will die. Now, based on what I have just told you about the state of the Republican Party today, there is no way, intellectually, to agree with that resolution. Thank you very much. "

It's great to be here with my friend, David Brooks, and also to be here with my friends Laura Ingraham and Ralph Reed who have devoted so much of their lives to fighting for principles they believe in. And I admire them both. I hope they lose badly, but I admire them both. I think the question here tonight is -- to put it even more bluntly: do the positions that they are speaking in behalf of serve this country well? And if they do not, if they do not stand for where America is and where America is going, what claim can they make for support from the American people who find a party that is increasingly at odds with the new, more tolerant, more diverse population that is going to elect America's political leaders for years to come? The fact is, Ralph, this is not the country of 1964 that the party recovered from. It's going to be much harder to recover in a society that looks like the one we have become. Let me be clear. I do not think the problem is that the Republican Party is conservative. The problem is that what it advocates -- what they advocate very sincerely is not at all consistent with what American conservatives have traditionally stood for, certainly not in the days of Ronald Reagan, who almost definitely could not win a Republican primary today. It's not consistent with the days when the Republican Party stood for things like prudence and responsibility and they did not attempt to dictate to the people how they were supposed to live and what their values were supposed to be. I spent a good many years championing the Republican Party and conservatism. Among the other things, besides chairing the American Conservative Union and the Conservative Political Action Conference, I chaired Ronald Reagan's 1980 policy task forces for his election. And I have watched this country change, and I have watched the Republican Party also change in the opposite direction. Americans still agree with conservative principles. They defend the right of citizens to own guns. But they don't applaud a party that supports people being able to carry loaded guns across state lines and into restaurants and schools and churches. The people support conservatism, but they don't support a political party that can't refrain from carrying every sound and defensible principle to its unacceptable extremes. You know, Ralph quoted people like Bobby Jindal, who has been giving speeches saying that what you're advocating will destroy the Republican Party. The people will support a political party that wants a smaller deficit and lower taxes and small government, but they're not going to support a party that draws the line, and when they're offered a chance to have lower taxes and smaller government, they say, “No, we're unwilling to compromise, accept any kind of a tax increase,” who are willing to say that compromise is bad, compromise is evil. You know, I'll tell you, compromise is what makes a nation of 300 million people work. And without compromise, drawing a line in the sand, you can't make it. Real conservatives support free enterprise and small business but not giant corporations with giant tax loopholes. And yet today's Republican Party would fight to the death to protect every single tax advantage of the wealthy, so they leave it to the middle class to pay for the wars and the roads and keeping the drinking water safe. So we have two questions, and one of them goes directly to a point that Ralph made. What does it mean to move to the center? I would not suggest that moving to the center means finding some precise magical spot on the 50-yard line of public opinion, but engaging in a rational politics that is within the range of reasonable and thoughtful discourse, a politics that stands for principle, as Ralph and Laura do, but also stands for the principle that self-government, government of the people, works. And in a nation of 300 million people, that means not just drawing a line in the sand, but fighting for what you believe, make your case, argue for it, get as much as you can and then find the common ground so that we can move together as one people, as one America. That's what the American people don't see. That's what the American people do not see in today's Republican Party. So people are fleeing from the political parties largely because of the dysfunction in Washington that traces back in large part to the kinds of people the Republican Party attracts and nominates for office. Will it doom the Republican Party? You saw Barack Obama with his numbers down and the economy in a mess get reelected. Laura has written that it's Mitt Romney's fault. Why did Mitt Romney do things that alienated the people? It's the only way you can win a Republican primary today, is to say the kinds of things that he did. So the -- and in terms of the other things, the nonpresidential races, we had this great chance in the Republican Party to win control of the Senate. Everybody thought we would win control. Democrats were going to lose control of the Senate. In fact, they gained seats. Why did they gain seats? Because Republicans put up candidates that allowed Democrats to win the Senate seats in Delaware, Nevada, Missouri, Indiana, who -- those were states where people were inclined to think good of Republicans, but they just could not go there. So the other question is what it means to be a political party. And it's not just about catering to whatever part of the population one agrees with, but being a serious contributor to the governance of America. So what's really at stake here are two things: Whether a hardcore, unyielding, uncompromising Republican Party can survive, and second, whether it should. The Republican Party must come back to the conversation, to the deliberation, to the search for common ground, to that broad range that makes up the rational center, or it, my party, will disappear, and it should. Please vote for the proposition. "

    "data":"Great to be here. And I have deep admiration for all of my co-panelist debaters. No snarky comments. All of them contribute to the dialogue, and I really appreciate the opportunity to be here. Last -- on Saturday, I was at the NRA 500. Do you guys know what that is? Anyone in Manhattan know -- it was a NASCAR race in Dallas. What a great country it is. I could be at the NRA 500, be here with you today. Is there any crossover audience, any people -- oh, none. Darn. I'm totally losing already. I'm a duck out of -- I'm a duck out of water, okay? I'm really a duck out of water here because for me, a centrist is someone who owns only two guns. Oh, come on. I have a question, if this thing is tied by the end, does the Supreme Court actually pick the winner like in 2000? Can we actually get Justice Scalia to write the opinion? I have to say that debating with David Brooks and Mickey Edwards, the politics -- David Brooks, an esteemed columnist for the New York Times, in New York is like -- it's like Barack Obama debating Wayne LaPierre about gun control at a gun show, okay? The odds are definitely stacked against us. But you must vote against this proposition. A couple of points first to Mickey's argument. If Mickey's argument is correct, then one would think that in the bluest of states, which would be very hospitable to moderate Republican views, quote, centrist views, people like Scott Brown would be victorious. Scott Brown obviously went down in flames. One would think that someone like the very centrist Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin would have won his Senate seat. Unfortunately Tommy Thompson, thought of as a middle-of-the-road Republican, went down in flames. Republicans had their issues, but for every Todd Aiken and Richard Murdoch, I can cite a Republican moderate who could not make the grade. The proposition should be rejected because moderate Republicanism, going to this mythical center, has been tried, and it has failed repeatedly. Last two elections. The Republican Party already died. It died in 2000 with the elite's choice, which was John McCain. Remember, back then, Mitt Romney was the insurgent candidate. I supported Mitt Romney in 2008. He was going up against John McCain, who was for immigration reform. He worked for Ted Kennedy on a bunch of issues. He was for McCain-Feingold. John McCain was the media's favorite Republican. John McCain went down in flames. Move forward to the last election. Everyone said, “The only guy who could beat Barack Obama would be Mitt Romney. Couldn't be that Rick Santorum. Certainly couldn't be Newt Gingrich.” Gosh, Jon Huntsman, the other moderate Republican, he got no traction. Lo and behold, Mitt Romney ran. Mitt Romney lost. Moderates usually lose elections with few exceptions. And before you pull out the “Chris Christie is a moderate and everybody loves him” example, let me tell you what The New York Times said about Chris Christie in 2009: Chris Christie, described as plainly conservative on issues such as school choice, rolling back regulations, and very restrictionist on abortion. Chris Christie won the governorship of New Jersey with the help of people like yours truly, the early Tea Party and conservatives. He was no middle-of-the-road centrist when he won. The proposition should be rejected for another reason. The mythical center. The proposition misunderstands what the word center means. Think about this. You don't seize the center. You create the center. Think about this. George Bush saying that conservatives should be more compassionate. Or Marco Rubio saying that you have to agree with Chuck Schumer on immigration. You say that. I don't know what you -- what you've seen, but to me, it seems a little bit more weak than you would have seemed if you just said, “You know, these are my views. Take them or leave them.” But Barack Obama -- did he seize the center in, let's say, 1994? When Newt Gingrich was changing the face of Republican politics in 1994 or when Ronald Reagan was triumphantly winning elections in the 1980s, did young Barack Obama say to himself, “Gosh, I've got to seize the center. I've got to move and adopt a new point of view, and a new tone, and a new idea, because guess what? Conservatism is all the rage. Unilateral disarmament is out the window. I need to seize the center.” Of course he didn't do that. And he was very smart not to do that. Constantly changing viewpoints are a fact of life in the United States. They usually change when someone makes a coherent, strong argument that the status quo is unacceptable, that the policies that are being advocated by the other side actually don't help the American people. So that to say, “seize the center or die” doesn't mean anything. I can remember when the center was the Defense of Marriage Act. Barack Obama believed in that centrist position. So did Bill Clinton. So did Hillary Clinton. So did most Americans. The left found a new way to approach it and guess what? The center changed. I can remember when the center position was for the war in Iraq. David was a big supporter of the war in Iraq, as was I. But guess what? Facts changed. Circumstances changed. Arguments changed. The center changed. Does that mean that people who had a principled view about the war in Iraq should seize the center and just admit that the war in Iraq was wrong? If that happened and, David, you wrote that column, I must have missed that. The proposition should be rejected because it misunderstands what a political party is. Mickey touched on this -- and I agree with him on this point. A political party doesn't exist just to get elected, right? A political party exists to make people's lives better. Edmund Burke -- I'm sure a lot of fans of Burke out there. But Edmund Burke said that, “Look. A political party is to implement certain agreed on principles. And by the way, it should -- you should reject the entreaties of the elites who will urge you to change your principles to fit the mood of the day.” We saw, time and again, people who come across as flip-floppers. They want to change their views for political convenience. And time and again, those people are rejected as candidates. A party does not exist to win elections. If it did, then guess what? We would have a different scenario today in the United States, because, guess what? Flip-floppers don't win. Would anyone have agreed that the center position of -- about slavery -- you think slavery is a good thing? Slavery in America is a good thing? That was a centrist position in 1850 during the famous 1850 compromise. That center changed. And it should. We had Abraham Lincoln. He came around and guess what? He was a Republican -- "

    "data":"Thank you so much. David and I are here to convince you that indeed the two-party system has rendered this country ungovernable. And the evidence is all around us. Wherever you look you see that we can only produce suboptimal solutions to our deepest crisis. And if you have any doubt about that just look around. Why do we still have banks that we have deemed to be too big to fail? Why did our two-party system produce three major disasters in recent years? The financial meltdown, the mining disaster that left 29 miners dead in West Virginia, the BP oil spill, just to mention three major disasters, that were produced as a result of our completely dysfunctional two-party system. And, you know, for many, many years we’ve kind of postponed solving our big problems, we’ve postponed dealing with our deficit, we've postponed dealing with the decline of the middleclass, we've postponed dealing with our crumbling infrastructure, we've postponed dealing with our deteriorating education system. Well, we can no longer keep postponing dealing with these problems. So while the two-party system might have been okay during the ordinary times, we’re not living in ordinary times right now. We actually have to solve our problems, we have no more reserves, we’ve run out of time, the chickens have come home to roost. And the problem with the two-party system is that is has made us all prisoners of conventional wisdom. It’s made us look at every political problem through that obsolete prism of right versus left. In fact our political problems are not susceptible to that easy completely reductionist way of looking at them. Let’s take Afghanistan, the media consider anybody who wants to leave Afghanistan as a lefty. In fact George Will, the Cato Institute, Pat Buchanan, Joe Scarborough, and many conservative intellectuals see no reason for us to be pursuing an unwinnable war at huge expense. Let’s look at reforming Wall Street. There are many good capitalists who sleep with a copy of Ayn Rand’s books under their pillow, who believe that Wall Street desperately needs reforming if it’s going to actually operate like a capitalist system as opposed to operating like an oligarchy, crony, system where losses are socialized and gains are privatized. Nevertheless the two-party system makes that kind of thinking impossible because we continue to see everything through that obsolete binary prism. But look around, the favorability ratings of the two parties are constantly declining. We now have Dems at about 39 percent favorability rating and Republicans at 34 percent. And the last election despite all the attention, despite all the media hoopla only 42 percent of the electorate voted. This is an enormous amount of dissatisfaction in the political system to have so many people not even participating in that most elementary duty of citizenship voting. And then let’s look at what would have happened in any other section of our life if we had such a vacuum. There would have been more competition; there would have been more participation from others, but not in our political system. Indeed inordinate amounts of power is folded in the hands of a few so-called centrist senators, like Olympia Snowe, do you remember during the healthcare debate for 14 months Democrats did everything they could to woo Olympia Snowe. They are like lovelorn high schoolers who are just not getting the message that she was just not into them. And John Adams predicted what would happen when he said that there is nothing I dread so much as a division of the Republic into two great parties each arranged under its leader and converting measures in opposition to each other.” But that’s exactly what we have done. And the hunger for change is overwhelming. The election of Barack Obama is evidence of that, the rise of the Tea Party is evidence of that. There is huge mistrust of our national institutions, politicians, business people, the media. And the rise of social media, the rise of the Internet has made it possible for young people especially to connect with each other, to reject the existing system, to opt out of politics and try to find solutions in their own communities, bypassing the political system. That’s not ultimately healthy because democracy is not a spectator sport. And if we’re going to revive democracy, if we’re going to overcome all the obstacles in the way of a truly Democratic system, you know, the way we have the huge advantages of incumbency, the difficulty of ballot access, the gerrymandering of our districts. If we’re going to overcome all these things, we need to actually bring more competition and more voices and fresh thinking to our political system. Because as Einstein put it, to paraphrase him, the problems we are facing right now cannot be solved at the same level of thinking that created them. And that’s all that the two parties are capable of. So, let me just end by quoting Thomas Jefferson. In a letter to Francis Hopkinson, he said, I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of man whatever, in religion, in philosophy, in politics, or in anything else, while I was capable of thinking for myself. Such an addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent. If I could not go to Heaven but with a party, I would not go to Heaven at all.” Well, it’s here that our two-party system is not taking us to Heaven. In fact, it’s rapidly taking us in the other direction. Thank you. "

    "data":"You know, I agree with Arianna about the utter cowardice and perfect ineffectuality of the two major political parties in dealing with any of the political problems that we face, and I would simply concede the debate if I were able to imagine some other political party or independent candidate -- left, right, or fanatically middle-of-the-road -- who would do a better job. It’s like trying to imagine a politician who would get up on the campaign stump and say, No, I can’t fix public education. The problem isn’t under-funding or over-crowding or teachers’ unions or a lack of a voucher system or absence of computer equipment in the classroom. The problem is your damn kids.” He wouldn’t get elected. And the problem is us damn voters. And it’s not our political parties, be they few or many. We have voted ourselves more government benefits than we care to pay for. And we’re broke. And, you know, so are all the other democracies in the world, no matter how many political parties they have. Indeed, other countries that aren’t democracies face the same problem. Everybody’s broke except China. And China has a per capita GDP of just $7,400 a year, as compared to the Dominican Republic’s per capita GDP of $8,600 a year. So the Chinese are broke too. So, given that we’re the problem, we might as well stick with the system that we’ve got. I mean, after all, we’re the ones who invented it. It must suit our needs in some way. The American two-party system is not a very good political system, but we Americans are not very good at politics. We’re just not. I mean, we don’t seek the good things in life from politics. We seek the good things in life from pluck and luck. You will notice that more people are interested in the New York State Lottery than are interested in the New York State government. Now, I would argue in favor of America’s two-party system not because of America’s two political parties but because America doesn’t really have political parties at all. I mean, we certainly don’t have political parties in the ideological sense. Republicans and Democrats don't have ideologies. They just have these vague platform planks made of rotten wood of political expediency? If American party platforms were backyard tree forts, you would not let your children climb in them. Anyone can join an American political party, even a witch. No one can be thrown out of an American political party. God knows my fellow Republicans, I have been trying with Sarah Palin, and you see where it's gotten us? Instead of political parties, what we have in America is two fund-raising mechanisms for a pair of general human tendencies. The tendency to leave things all screwed up like they've always been and the tendency to get the government involved and screw things up more. Democrats are the party that says government can make us all richer, smarter, taller, thinner. Get the crab grass out of our lawns, you know? The Republicans are the party that says government doesn't work and then they get elected, and then they prove it. We have the stupid party, and we have the silly party. Now, I belong to the stupid party. I vote Republican because Republicans have fewer ideas. Not few enough as you may have noticed in Iraq, but you know. Stupid party and the silly party. That would seem to me to cover the range of human political thought. What do we want to add to that? The insane party? The confused party, the violent party, the drunken, naked party. Well, maybe. Now, if the key question is governability, two-party system, they've done pretty well by world historical systems, little glitch in 1860. We're used to the idea of political parties causing civil wars, Spain, Vietnam, Nicaragua. But in the case of our own civil war, both the Whigs and the Democrats split on the issue of slavery, thereby in fact actually delaying our civil war for more than a decade which may very well have ensured that the right side won in our civil war. Our two political parties, silly and stupid as they may be, they've shown an ability to reconstitute or replace themselves when the nation needs it most. The Republican party came from the mess of the Whigs and the anti-slavery Democrats in time to win the Civil War. The Democratic party realigned, broke the power of the dixiecrats in time to win the battle for civil rights, you know. Even in these days of supposed extreme political polarization between Republicans and Democrats, there is a big overlap of feelings and ideas. You know, the rich should get richer but only if I'm one of them, right? The poor need help, but can't they knock it off with the drugs, the crime, the tattoos and the dumb music? We see this overlap in the number of Americans -- I'm sure many of you will be among them -- who tell pollsters they are independent or, as many of us put it when we're phoned by pollsters, "Go to hell. I'm eating dinner." But to be completely outside the two-party system just deprives candidates of any need for a sort of broad appeal, which is why America's third parties have been weird--anti-Masonic party, trying to keep my dad from wearing a fez and riding around on a tiny motorcycle. The know-nothing party, the name says it all. The greenback party. They wanted money to be worth less. That dream came through. So, we Republicans had Teddy Roosevelt which got us Woodrow Wilson in World War I. You Democrats had Ralph Nader who got you George W. Bush and the Iraq war. In the matter of political systems, never believe that they can't get worse. And in the matter of our two-party political system, I would say dance with the one that brung ya'. "

    "data":"So the defender of the two-party system starts out by conceding that parties are cowardly, ineffectual and stupid and so stands by the proposition that we can't do any better, which is good counter programming toward Obama standing on a position of hopelessness and changelessness, more or less standing up for the Let's go suck on a gas pipe party. And I suggest you support P.J. if you have Jack Kevorkian on your speed dial, that we can't do any better. But then in the middle of his remarks, a sort of miracle occurs, and after telling us how stupid the parties are, suddenly he decides they are about to reconstitute themselves into something not half bad. P.J. and I are old friends, and I know he took a lot of drugs in the '60s. Call Rockefeller University. Apparently, they're still hanging around. Now, Arianna spoke about the broad dysfunction of our parties. I'm going to speak about the narrow dysfunction, especially in Washington where I cover it. I cover politicians very closely. And I can tell you, from this context, politicians are all emotional freaks of one sort or another. They have what I call logorrhea dementia, which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane.But they do have these intense social antennae so they, if you meet them, they will guarantee to invade your personal space. They'll stand too close, rub the back of your head. I was campaigning with Mitt Romney up in New Hampshire once, and he was campaigning in a diner with his five perfect sons, Bip, Chip, Rip, Lip, Sip and Dip. And we go in the diner. He introduces himself to a family and then says, What village in New Hampshire are you from?” And then he describes the home he owned in their village. And then he goes around the diner and then first-names everybody on the way out.  So they're weird social creatures. Nonetheless, I would say in general, they are better people than one would anticipate. Most of them are in it for the right reason, but they're stuck in a rotten system. They're stuck in our current two-party system which forces them to behave in ways that are worse than they are. It's a mind suck. First of all, they cannot be entrepreneurial.They cannot think for themselves because they have to hew the party line. They get -- every Tuesday. They go to a lunch. They get the message of the week. They have to parrot the message of the week. It's a soul suck. They can't behave nicely or even get to know the people in the other party because there are unofficial barriers.  I went to something called the Civility Conference where Annenberg took House members from both parties to the Green Briar Hotel and got them to work together, or to meet together. And I went to the dining room. It was like junior high, all the Republicans over here, all the Democrats over here. They know nothing about each other. When a member of a party starts describing to me the -- what's going to happen on the other side, I know everything they're about to tell me is wrong because they know nothing about each other.  Finally, it's freedom destroying. They come in wanting to cut deals, talking in private about what they'd like to achieve. But they're in a tribal mentality in what -- what theycan achieve is severely limited by the tribal sort of Tutsi versus Hutu nature of our politics of the current two-party system. So as a result, they find themselves unable to lead the lives they'd like to lead. Arianna talked about how the big problems are therefore not addressed because they are stuck in these little trenches. These problems come up every day, the squeezing of the middle class unaddressed. I would talk about today's story, the issue of the budget. We are facing a fiscal meltdown in this country. And if you took individuals outside the party context that we have now, I bet we could all cut a deal. We could figure out what taxes needed to go up and what spending needs to go down. But we're stuck in this dysfunctional marriage where, first of all, 85 percent of the budget is completely off the table because neither party wants to touch it. Secondly, you've got the Republicans who at least have big ideas for cutting the spending. But they have no idea what spending should be cut and what isn't, so they're cutting some of our most valuable programs like Head Start and early childhood education because that's the party dogma. Then on the Democrat side, they've got some decent ideas to save Head Start and early childhood education.  But the present -- the Democrats have no persuasive ideas so we can actually cut the budget deficit and avoid national bankruptcy by 2015 or 2019. In 2019, we will be paying interest on the debt equal to about 800, $900 billion. And this problem has been building and building and building. We are completely unable to solve it because the Republicans refuse to raise taxes, which is going to have to happen, the Democrats refuse to talk about Medicare and Social Security reductions, which are going to have to happen. We are stuck and we are heading toward a national disaster. So the first thing we need to do is get out of the system where we’re stuck in these party ruts. The University of Maryland had a very interesting study where they took Tea Party people, they took liberals, and they said, Here’s our budget problem, you deal with it.” And the Tea Party people acknowledged that they had to raise taxes, the people on the far left acknowledged some spending had to be cut. They all could do it. But the two-party system can’t do it. The second thing we have to do is mobilize independence. We probably need a third party, but we certainly need a de-alignment, we need more movements to come in and affect the parties so people are less hewn to these tribal parties and that’s what the parties have become, they’ve become tribes, almost ethnic tribes. They are no longer the normal political groupings that they were 20 or 30 years ago. They’ve become tribes where your honor is attached to your tribe and any compromise seems like a sign of shame and dishonor and therefore they’re not willing to do it. So we need to get more movements involved, take up the two parties. And then finally we need a philosophy, we’ve got two parties in this country, but we’ve got three movements. The first movement is a liberal movement that believes in using government to enhance equality. The second movement is a conservative movement that believes in limited government to enhance freedom. But starting at the foundation of our Republic there was a movement starting with Alexander Hamilton going up to Abraham Lincoln going up to Teddy Roosevelt which believed in limited but energetic government to enhance social mobility, to give people the tools to compete. This is not big government, it’s not little government, it’s energetic government to give people the tools to thrive in a capitalist economy. That centrist movement is completely unrepresented by the two parties and yet it’s where the largest percentage of Americans are. So if you think, if you take a look at the fiscal situation, if you take a look at some of these big issues and you can see our current two-party system leading to a solution in the near term, you can vote for those guys, but if you can’t see a plausible way out of our problems I suggest you vote for us, thank you.

    "data":"I'd like to begin by quoting something that I saw in the press just the other day, Things haven't been moving in Washington, a young Democratic president with an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress can't get much of anything passed except for defense and appropriations, which certainly doesn't add up to dynamism, a sense of delusion has set in among friends as well as foes. That, from Time Magazine, September 7th, 1962, and the young president they're talking about is John F. Kennedy. And the point that I'd like to begin with is that people always say and have always said that America is ungovernable and that these are times as Arianna put it which are extraordinary, different than other times, and require extraordinary and brand new solutions. But America has always been in unusual times. That's how it always seems to people when they're alive, that they're living in unprecedented times. In the 1920s, America confronted Prohibition which made it seem that the country was ungovernable and also, you know, no place to get a drink. In the 1930s, there was a depression in this country which was far worse than the economic situation today obviously. In the 1940s, America was able to mobilize itself to go to war against Nazi Germany and Japan even though there was a strong sentiment in this country not to go to war, an America First Sentiment, which was overcome. In the 1950s, we all -- those of us who are old enough to remember, used to hide under our desks in the nuclear drills because we were sure that we were going to get bombed by the Russians. But, in the event, America won the Cold War. In the 1960s, the halcyon days of our youth -- my team anyway -- -- we not only were living in an ungovernable society, but we were contributing to it, and happily. The 1970s were Watergate, a disaster. It was the end of American democracy. The president was forced to step down, never happened before. Somehow the country survived those extraordinary times. And what brought it through each time was the two-party system, which is a stable and consistent system in this country. It’s what provides stability for the United States, politically speaking. The 1980s -- anybody -- some of you remember the 1980s, it looks like. That was the decade that Japan was going to take over and dwarf the American economy, something like the Chinese. And, by the way, the Japanese growth national product per capita is less than America’s today. And then, of course, we’re living in New York, the ungovernable city, as it was called by Nathan Glazer in 1961, and as it was referred to by others before Rudy Giuliani became mayor. And if you look out the window, those of you who came here today, you don’t see an ungovernable city. You see a well governed city, both under Giuliani and also under Bloomberg. This was a miracle, but here we are. The American system is a resilient system. And the notion that this country’s ungovernable is a media trope. It’s not true. It hasn’t been true. I can prove it to you, if you want, with statistics. The World -- is it the World Bank? I’m not too good at my notes here. Because they’re in Hebrew and who can read -- You know, seriously, I’m reading backwards. It’s not funny. I had some -- actually, I did have some great statistics. I thought I was going to impress David Brooks with them, but you’ll have to take my -- oh, here it is Okay, the World Bank index -- it has a thing called the Index of Governability, which is so handy for a debate like this. And I just looked it up. You know, why argue when you can have fact-based, evidence-based arguements. All right. The World Bank takes into account one, two, three, four, five metrics. Accountability and voice, which goes to what Arianna was discussing, effectiveness of the government, the quality of regulation, the rule of law, and the control of corruption -- in all of those indices, the United States scored above the 90th percentile in the world, which is an A,” even at NYU. And only in public stability, which is a function of terrorism, does it get a B.” In other words, the American system is a -- if you say compared to what? Compared to utopia, it’s a replaceable system. If you compare it to the rest of the systems of the world, it’s a pretty good system. And, as P.J. said, it’s also the system that fits this country. It was built for this country. And it has lasted a very long time. Back in the day, there was a columnist that we grew up on, Walter Lippmann. And here’s what he wrote, and I like to close with it. This is about force of representation, proportional voting, but it stands for the system in general. He said that the objection that popular government cannot be conducted without the two-party system is, I believe, refuted by the experience of Europe.”  If I had to choose between a congressional caucus and a coalition ministry, I should not have to hesitate very long.” That was written in 1914, the year that World War I began inexplicably. And I would say that if you look at that system, the European system and the American system, which are the only two real Democratic systems in the world, the American system has done pretty well in the last 80 years. And I think it's a -- "

    "data":"Thank you. It’s a privilege to be here and against such august opposition. I’m going to start by disagreeing, and it’s probably not a good idea to disagree with your host, but Mr. Rosenkranz made a comment in his opening remarks that the criminal justice is about punishing criminals after the fact. And that’s a notion I would like to disabuse our audience of because the criminal justice system is much more robust than that. It’s there -- our law enforcement and working hand in hand with intelligence, is there to detect crime before it happens, to infiltrate terrorist networks, to deter attacks. And we don’t have to wait for a crime to be completed before stepping in. we’ve seen it over and over again where the police or the FBI or New York, NYPD breaks up a terrorist cell or just discovers a plot in progress or conspiracy, and those people can be arrested. They can be interrogated by law enforcement, and in those interrogations yield a lot of information. There’s this perception somehow that reading people Miranda rights automatically means that they’re never going to talk again. And it’s true that sometimes when advised to the right to an attorney and the right to remain silent, that people clam up, but not always. In fact quite often, they divulge a lot of information. And so we’re able to charge people with attempting crimes, with conspiracies to commit crimes and put a lot of terrorists away. In fact, since 9/11 we -- the federal -- and talking only about federal prosecutions, over 400 terrorists have been locked up for an average of 20 years apiece. Now contrast that with Guantanamo, which started with -- or at its peak had 787 detainees. Of course -- and all of whom were at one time accused of being enemy combatants. The Bush administration ended up releasing over two-thirds of those when they realized they had no evidence against the vast majority of them. Another 100 were cleared for release before President Obama took over. Another 100 have been cleared for release now. So what’s the scorecard now? We have four detainees who have been prosecuted successfully in military commission: four convictions versus 400. The Obama administration after a year-long review determined that there were 35 detainees that should be tried in some criminal form and there’s another 48 that they say are too dangerous. So we’re talking about 83 people, after seven or eight years that they’ve decided are really the bad guys. And this is the danger of simply labeling people with -- as enemy combatants. And you have to think about the implications of what is being proposed here because as a whole -- and Mr. Thiessen acknowledged it -- they want to go back to the program of the prior administration. And what did that entail? It entailed locking people up indefinitely without charge, without access to courts, without access to counsel, subjecting them to a full range of interrogation techniques, many of which are abhorrent to American values. And they were not given the opportunity to defend themselves, to even find out what the basis for their detention was. And that’s the system that Mr. Thiessen would like to return to. And I think it’s a fundamentally un-American system. Terrorists are criminals, nothing more. It may be that they have particularly grandiose criminal plans. But by labeling them as combatants, we actually legitimize them. We elevate their status to a warrior status which is what they seek. And we engage in a war on their terms. And I don’t think that’s a good idea. Let me pose a question. Mr. Thiessen posed a question to you and he talked about the fact that there hasn’t been any attacks as if this is proof that those methods, the illegal interrogation methods and treating people as enemy combatants worked and that’s the reason we didn’t have any attacks. Let me tell you why we didn’t have any attacks. And of course there were a number of attempted attacks. But the reason is because we entered into -- by treating terrorism primarily as a military problem, as a war, we started two voluntary, unnecessary wars, in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we presented the terrorists with hundreds of thousands of targets, American soldiers. And as bad as 9/11 was, and 3,000 people died on that day, but we have lost 5700 American service members dead. Another 1100 coalition members dead in Iraq and Afghanistan and 39,000 American service members injured. It’s basically revived the Veterans Administration Hospitals because we have a whole generation of wounded warriors out there who have been fighting wars that really aren’t necessary. And are we safer? That’s the question you really have to ask. Are we safer after eight years of this approach? Ask yourself this question. Are there more people in the world -- according to Mr. Thiessen, there were two little terrorist cells of al-Qaeda after 9/11. How many terrorists are there right now in the world or violent jihadists who are willing to strap a bomb to their bodies and kill Americans, or plant roadside bombs? We have essentially launched a global war -- and that’s what we called it, the global war on terror that the Islamic world interpreted it as a war on them and we have alienated tens and hundreds of millions of people unnecessarily. And we are not safer. We are not safer when we abandon our core values. And that’s ostensibly -- they use coded language but that’s what they’re talking about because they’re talking about not using law enforcement methods, not using traditional tools. They want a world of perfect security where no crimes are ever committed, where no terrorists attack. That’s never going to happen. And when you seek, strive for that, we end up with a police state. The safest country in the world is North Korea, but we don’t want to live in North Korea. "

    "data":"Well, I think Marc and David have kind of teed up the question pretty nicely for us here. Are we a nation at war or are we not? Should we perceive ourselves to be at war or should we not? David said that our adversary in this thing out there, war or not, are criminals and nothing more. But if that’s the case, let me take you back almost a year to the day to the Horn of Africa, to Somalia, to American Navy SEAL, in a helicopter, a Seahawk, coming off a Navy carrier in the Indian Ocean, going after an individual named Sullah Nabhan, at the time was the leader of al-Qaeda in Somalia, al-Qaeda in the Horn of Africa. We killed him. We landed long enough to swab up portions of his remain to get DNA evidence that we had killed him. I wasn’t in the mission, I was out of government at this time, I wasn’t privy to the pre-brief. But I know what was asked by the field commander before he got on the helicopter. Sir, is this a kill or a capture? And it’s very clear from what happened, he was told this is a kill. No probable cause, no warrant, no court. Because we are a nation at war and Saleh Ali Nabhan was part of an opposing armed enemy force. I became an advocate; my epiphany that we are a nation at war took place about 10 minutes after 10:00, September 11th, 2001. It became clear to me at that point and I believe in few things more firmly than I believe in the fact that we are a nation at war. President Obama has said we are a nation at war. President Bush has said we are a nation at war. In March of 2007, I went to the German residence to give a talk to all the ambassadors to the United States from the nations of the European Union. And Germany was in the chair of the E.U.; they were inviting these ambassadors in; they invited an American to come in and kind of be the lunchtime entertainment. Bob Gates was there at one point, Condi Rice at another; this was my turn and I decided to say something interesting. I decided to talk our European friends about rendition, detention and interrogation. I had a wonderful speechwriting staff at CIA, but this was a speech that I took a personal hand at. On page two of that speech, I simply said to our European friends, let me tell you what I believe, what my agency believes, what I believe my country believes. We are a nation at war. We are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates. This war is global in scope and I can only fulfill my legal and moral responsibilities to the citizens of my republic by taking this fight to this enemy wherever he may be. A year ago last August, August of 2009 I was in Phoenix. President Obama was addressing the VFW. He said quite clearly we are at war; we are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates. Now I know most of the American population doesn’t sense they are at war. I know that. The American Armed Forces know that we are. The American security establishment knows that we are. The American intelligence community knows that we are. You, your political processes have sent me, a career military officer, the director the CIA to war. You have told me to defend you. Do not take away from me the tools that I need to perform the service you demand. At some point in our conversation tonight, there will be a discussion here about we need to uphold the rule of law. I could not agree more. It just matters what model of law we are committed to upholding. Is this an issue best addressed through American criminal law or is this an issue best addressed through the laws of armed conflict? I submit to you that it’s only the laws of armed conflict that will keep you safe. This isn’t theoretical for me; this was real. I had a meeting with my general counsel and his team at CIA about two years ago. I said to the team, our enemy is opening a new front. They are beginning to attack us, with attack in quotes, it’s a bit metaphorical. They are beginning to attack us in the American legal system. We have to best them in the legal system the way we are defeating them in the tribal region of Pakistan. And I told my lawyers, I want you to lean as far forward and the hardest as you possibly can in terms of giving information to our court system. I want blood on the harness, you are leaning so far forward. We worked our tails off in those judicial processes, specifically habeas corpus. When we got a point where we could go no farther, one of the judges demanded that we provide not him, but the defendant, the name and the identity of the intelligence source we had used in order to determine that he was a member of al-Qaeda. I know you don’t live in the world I used to live in, but there is nothing that a director of CIA could do in those circumstances. You cannot let the world know that sources who risk everything, who risk all to work for you, will have their names revealed in the American judicial process, to the individual they have identified as al-Qaeda. The Christmas attack is another little morality play. It really demonstrates the fallacy of treating this as a law enforcement matter. When Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to down an American aircraft, he was a member of al-Qaeda; he was an enemy combatant. It was an attack mounted from outside the United States towards and in the United States. And because of a law enforcement mentality, we sent a clean team in there. A clean team; that is somebody in the FBI who knew nothing of what Abdulmutallab had told us. After only 50 minutes of interrogation, every known al-Qaeda aircraft attack this country has involved multiple threats of attack: 9/11, 2006 from London, the Bojinka plot over the Pacific. And yet after 50 minutes, our instincts were so strong to the law enforcement that we allowed him to lawyer up. That’s unconscionable. That’s a terrible decision. It is based upon a model that you know, he’s just a criminal and we just need to make sure we get him in jail. That’s not the objective here. The objective is to keep you safe. "

    "data":"First of all, let me tell you that I am a Republican and I voted for George Bush both times, and I voted for John McCain and yes, Sarah Palin, and I don’t apologize for that. I don’t think the argument here is political. I think the argument is constitutional and it basically boils down to how far we are willing to sacrifice our ideals, our history, our beliefs as a nation for security. And is that security real or temporary? Has the target of our adversaries simply moved offshore, much like banking and investment, or is the target here? For various law enforcement agencies and members of the national intelligence establishment who have protected us and work long and devoted hours, there can be no criticism. But that’s hardly the issue, nor frankly is the ACLU the issue. The issue quite simply is whether we are a nation of laws, and there are three reasons, compelling reasons why you should vote against this resolution and vote no. The first is that the United States of America did not happen accidentally. There was a political deal, a bargain. The bargain was this; that the twelve states that participated in the Philadelphia Convention would surrender some of their rights which they held very importantly, to a central government that they had no experience with. And in return for that surrender of their rights to that central government, that government would, as its first order of business, pass a series of amendments of the Constitution to restrict the power of that government which they had agreed to join. So the right, the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, the right to petition, redress of grievances, the right to a fair trial, to due process, to protection against self-incrimination, to the assistance of counsel, to be safe and secure unless a warrant is issued by law enforcement to search it, the right to a public trial, the right to a speedy trial. For all of those, are in the first 10 amendments. And the bargain was redeemed. And 100 years later, or almost 100 years later, that bargain was purchased and redeemed by the blood of more Americans who died in the Civil War than all the other wars. By the Civil War, President Lincoln’s address at Gettysburg and the passage of the 14th amendment, we as a nation reaffirmed the ideal which is due process of law, equal protection of all people under the Constitution. Not something that we always follow, and there have been black holes in our history, but that is our ideal; that is the American experience: a written Constitution that limits the power of government. Secondly, the United States is, for millions, hundreds of millions of people in the world, their ideal. One of our presidents once referred to a letter by one of the early English governors, that United States is a city upon a hill. Well it is a city upon a hill and what makes us special is that we try, every day and in every way, most of us, to uphold those ideals. And if we were to surrender even temporarily those ideals, if we were willing to say, to these individuals who are charged, charged not convicted, charged with terrorist offenses, that we will be like Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the early ‘70s and we will suspend these basic rights, these things that our national experience have taught us, we would lose many of the allies, supporters, and people who in their hearts look at the United States. And finally, having represented a terrorist -- and before 9/11, the Oklahoma City bombing was the greatest act of domestic terrorism in this country. 168 people dead, 19 of them children under the age of six. Eight federal law enforcement agents, over a billion dollars of uninsured damages, 500 people seriously injured and 30,000 who sought and received mental or emotional intervention because of their disturbances. But Tim McVeigh was tried and convicted before a jury in a federal court. He had lawyers; he got a change of venue; he got a severance; he got the money through the federal system to pay his lawyers, to investigate the case and bring witnesses to Denver, Colorado even in the last days of that trial, the G-7 summit was meeting in Denver. But in our country, our security forces, our law enforcement was able to provide both a fair trial for Tim McVeigh and protect the world’s leaders meeting five miles away. Now, ladies and gentlemen, the courts are a sanctuary in the jungle; that’s what they are. They are to determine justice is blind; we don’t have a special court for people we call a terrorist. We don’t have a special criminal court for drug dealers; we don’t have a special criminal court for murderers or people who commit other crimes, whether serious or small. We have a federal judicial system and a state judicial system and then for the armed forces, the uniform code of military justice. Because 200 years national experience has taught us that our safety comes just as much from adherence to the rule of law as it does to the talents of our intelligence agencies and our law enforcement agencies. The history of our country is on the side that Dave and I represent. And I urge you to vote no and to affirm the rule of law, regardless of how despicable persons may be. For in the final analysis the justice of a society is measured by how it treats its worst, not its best. "

    "data":"Well, I would hate to concede that, and I would note that I do have a top secret FBI clearance, but I did not get the opportunity to see much of the intelligence that would have come across the desk of general Hayden. I would hope that that intelligence did not come across the desk of Marc Thiessen. But -- but some of it somehow seems to have gotten its way into his book. So maybe we ought to be investigating that. But -- Okay. I want you to think back to that time. I want you to think back to the scenes of burning rubble. I want you to think back to the shock that you felt at the ability of the terrorists to penetrate our defenses and launch such an attack like that in our midst. And the questions we were all asking. Who had attacked us? What do they want? Were there more attacks coming? If I had told you back then that we would go almost a decade without another terrorist attack, who would have believed me? Very few, I think, a few. Most of thought it was going to be the first of many attacks. I was in the Pentagon on September 11th, 2001. I was blessed not to be not at the point of impact, but I was a few corridors down and I remember feeling the building shudder; I remember the smell of the smoke in the hallways. And the one thing I remember very distinctly is that the alarms never went off, the evacuation alarms. We all just sort of filed out of the building and went on out to the lawn and looked back at the broken and burning Pentagon. But in the months that followed, the alarms went off a bunch of times as false reports of impending attacks, planes that were headed our way kept coming in. And every time, the whole building, we would all evacuate and go out on the lawn and look up at the sky, waiting for the attack that never came. Why did that attack never come? I would submit to you there are only two possibilities. Either the terrorists lost interest in attacking us again, or we found out what their plans were and stopped them from carrying them out. Mike Hayden and I will argue tonight that the latter is the case. We will argue that the reason that attack did not happen is because we abandoned the law enforcement approach to terrorism that failed to stop the 1992 World Trade Center bombing, that failed to stop the attack on the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, that failed to stop the attack on the USS Cole, that failed to stop the attacks of 9/11. That we abandoned that approach and began to treat terrorists as enemy combatants and not criminals. In those early days after 9/11, we knew almost nothing about the enemy who had attacked us. We did not know that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the mastermind of 9/11; he wasn’t even on our charts. And we didn’t know who his accomplices were. And unbeknownst to us, there were two terrorist networks out there, at large, planning new attacks. The KSM network that had planned and carried out 9/11, and the Hambali network which was a Southeast Asian terrorist that KSM had organized because he knew we’d be on the lookout for Arab men. And those terror networks were in the advanced stages of planning a series of attacks including a plot to blow up high-rise apartment buildings in the United States using natural gas, a plot to repeat 9/11 in Europe by flying airplanes into Heathrow Airport in downtown London, a plot to blow up the U.S. consulate in Karachi and western residences in Karachi, an al-Qaeda cell that was developing anthrax for attacks inside the United States and a cell, the Garaba [spelled phonetically] cell, the southeast Asians who KSM had tasked to fly an airplane into the tallest building in the west coast, the Library Tower in Los Angeles. We did not know any of this, not a word. We didn’t know who those people were, what they had planned. And then we started capturing terrorists. Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi Binalshibh, KSM, and they provided us information that allowed us to round up and dismantle both of those terror networks. When KSM was captured and brought into custody, he was asked about upcoming attacks. You know what he said? I’ll tell you everything when I get to New York and see my lawyer. Ladies and gentlemen, our opponents tonight would have granted that request. And if we had listened to their advice, if we had told KSM you have the right to remain silent, there would be craters in the ground in Los Angeles and Karachi and London and other cities in this country because of the attack that we did not stop. This debate is about more than Miranda rights. The Obama administration had eliminated the CIA program, but at least they’re killing terrorists using predator drones, right? No, no, no say our opponents, that’s illegal too. The ACLU and Center for Constitutional Rights filed a lawsuit a couple weeks ago saying that because terrorists outside of Iraq and Afghanistan are criminals and not enemy combatants, we cannot kill terrorists in those areas using predator drones. So if you believe that we should not kill terrorists using predator drones, then vote for them.  The fact is that that program has killed half the al-Qaeda leadership and it is probably the only thing standing between us and another 9/11. One final point, our opponents are going to try to turn this into a debate on waterboarding. I’m happy to have that debate. As John pointed out, I wrote a book defending it. But if they’re arguing about waterboarding, they’re losing and I’ll tell you why. It is a little known fact -- how many people think Barack Obama ended waterboarding? He didn’t. My debate partner Mike Hayden ended waterboarding. When Mike Hayden handed over the CIA program to Barack Obama, the techniques involved were the tummy slap, the facial hold, mild sleep deprivation and a diet of liquid Ensure. I’m sure the makers of liquid Ensure will be thrilled to know that their product is torture. Bottom line is, there is a wide area between waterboarding on one hand and telling KSM and other terrorists, you have the right to remain silent. So you can be against waterboarding and for the proposition, that we should treat terrorists as criminals, as -- before the proposition, we should treat terrorists as enemy combatants and not criminals. So finally I’d just like to ask you, keep in mind, if you would like to keep killing terrorists with predator drones, if you would like -- if you think that our first priority in the war on terror, when we capture a terrorist should be interrogating them for intelligence, not obtaining evidence for prosecution; if you want to continue the approach to counterterrorism that has prevented us from being struck again as we were on 9/11, then I ask you to vote for our position. If you would like to eliminate all those tools, I suggest you vote for the other side and find a safe place to hide. Thank you. "

    "data":"So the internet has so narrowed my mind that I didn't hear a word Jacob said. So in these brief comments, I will explain what Eli and I mean by the internet as invoked in the resolution and what we mean by politics. And I'm going to convince you to support the resolution. First, try to remember 1999, the days of AOL, the days of Prodigy, the apex of our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity. In 1999, Thomas Friedman wrote these words: the internet is going to be like a huge vise. It's going to keep tightening and tightening that system” --meaning the system of globalization -- around everyone in ways that will only make the world smaller, smaller and faster and faster. Well, Thomas Friedman could not have been more wrong. He's been exactly that wrong many times, but never more wrong. Now, in 2012, it's clear that there is no such thing as The Internet,” capital T, capital I as Friedman and others so often described in the 1990s. There is no equalizing force, great democratizing force, there is no global network of networks that unites us all and gives us all equal voice to interact with each other across borders and across classes, for that matter. In fact, the alleged network of networks is, in 2012, balkanized, nationalized, compromised, anesthetized, supervised, circumcised and hypnotized. It's far from global, and it's getting less so every day. The online experience of a person sitting in Turkey is so different from the online experience of someone sitting in India and so different from the online experience of someone sitting in Iran or someone sitting in China. And all of those are even more different from the experiences of people in Brazil, in Russia or the United States. And we're talking about more than censorship, although, in many of those countries, online censorship is a serious and crippling issue. We're also talking about platforms, the platforms that people use, the platforms that governments will let people use. The rise of kill switches is something we have to take into account as well. Kill switches that we saw a year ago in Egypt to wipe out internet communication in an instant, we've seen experiments in kill switches in China in early 2012, and we've seen people like Senator Lieberman even propose them in the United States. Internet technologies amplify so much of what we already are and what we already want. And the fact is, we're pretty provincial animals. So add the internet to it, we just double down. We get more provincial. Platforms matter, defaults matter, and policies matter. So here in 2012, or now in 2012, we are not all holding virtual hands with our Facebook friends across the globe singing, We are the world. There is no coordinated global movement for justice. There's no sophisticated online debate about our collective human state or even our basic human needs. The dominant powers governing our digital experiences, the state, for instance, in China, or corporations in Brazil or the United States are not interested in such matters. They are not interested in us being political. Sometimes these powers actively restrict us, like in China. More often than not, these powers seduce us into shallow consumption, consumptive behaviors like shopping or giggling at cats or clicking on cows. Not that there's anything wrong with clicking on virtual cows, but it ain't political. Our minds are closing because our attentions are distracted, fractured and segregated into niches and nations. But all hope is not lost. There is nothing about the nature of the internet that prevents us from being political, richly political. Many of us actually are, I would suspect that most of us in the audience have done a pretty good job of avoiding these traps. We're pretty elite. We're pretty aware. And we're pretty connected. And we route around a lot of these problems. We're also hungry for information. If you weren't hungry, you wouldn't be here. So many of us, despite what Facebook does with thoughts, despite what the Iranian government does in Iran, have managed to be richly political. But we do know that the internet by itself does not topple dictators, does not undermine newspapers. It's just not that simple. If we recognized the biases inherent in many of the platforms of our media systems, we can correct, we can adjust, we can invest, we can invent, we can resist, persist, and thrive. We could build platforms that enhance Republican deliberation and extend cosmopolitan perspectives. We just haven't done that yet. We've been really busy clicking on cows. But all that takes work. It takes real human work in addition to invention and imagination, real human effort. But the first step to recognizing that -- I'm sorry -- the first step to realizing that is to recognize what's happening. When it comes to politics, the Internet, most importantly how we experience the Internet is closing our minds one cow click at a time. Please vote for the motion. Thanks. "

    "data":"Well, I'm glad that Siva has chosen to debate with Thomas Friedman rather than with us, but I'd like to begin with a few lessons from history. First, technology always plays the scapegoat whenever it comes to debates about the closing of the American mind. Remember Allan Bloom and his bestselling book, The Closing of the American Mind, in the '80s? Well, let me remind you, Bloom has actually argued that the closing of the American mind occurs because of CD players and headphones. And he actually argued that those might incite teenagers to kill their parents. We know what the late Allan Bloom would have made of the iPad, why his reactionary torch is now being carried by the liberal crowd from MoveOn is beyond me. The second lesson from history is that concerns about online polarization are as old as the [unintelligible]. As early as 1995, the Nation Magazine carried an article by Andrew Shapiro, which argued, and I quote, Cyberspace is shaping out to be more like suburbia than cy-Berkeley, where you interact only with people of your choosing and with information tailored to your desires. That was 1995. Six years later, Cass Sunstein argued that, The Internet is serving as a breeding ground for extremism because likeminded people are deliberating with one another without hearing contrary views, end of quote. So enter Eli Pariser. In one respect, he follows in the tradition of Shapiro and Sunstein. All of them present virtually no evidence that such online segregation is taking place. But they're also different. Where Shapiro and Sunstein worried that we, the users, might choose the easy way out and simply award our comfortable viewpoints, but Pariser argues that filters and algorithms are doing this for us. It's a very important difference. Shapiro and Sunstein blame the filter bubble on us, the users. But Pariser blames it on the companies. Now, who doesn't like such an exciting conspiracy theory? After all, it's always good to find someone else to blame but us. I think this is a fairytale for many of the reasons that Jacob has outlined, but let me also provoke and give you three examples of how filters naturally enhance our political culture. So let's take Twitter. Many people think that Twitter, unlike Google and Facebook, does not engage in customizing and filtering. That is actually not true. Twitter does hide certain types of messages. Thus, if you follow me but you don't follow Siva, and I send Siva a public tweet, you will not see that tweet. Just think about it, you choose to follow me and you probably expect to get all of my messages, but you're actually not seeing my tweet to Siva. And, mind you, Twitter made that filtering decision on your behalf. Is it paternalistic? Sure. Are these types of paternalism justified? Well, take my case. I follow more than 2,000 people on Twitter, and I'm very happy with the breadth of news I get. But if I have to read every single conversation that these 2,000 people have with thousands of people that they know but I don't know, I will have never managed to follow 2,000 people. At best, I would follow 100. This is the beauty of it, Twitter's [unintelligible] filter allows me to access more, not less useful information. Now, let's take Facebook. It has 800 million users. Some of them are heavy users, they have 5,000 friends and spend hours on it every day. Others open it every few weeks and only have a few dozen friends. So Facebook has built this very collaborative differentiation. If you are a heavy user, it presents you all updates from your friends in the chronological order. That’s the most recent updates from all your friends come first. However, if you only use it occasionally, they will show you only the most interesting updates. The assumption there is that if you have been away for three weeks and you only have 30 minutes to catch up, why go through thousands of messages in chronological order? To Facebook and to me, this seems like a reasonable assumption. That’s why relevance rather than recency is the default filter for the occasional users. If you want to see all the recent messages, all you have to do, as Jacob said, is just click a button called most recent. Sure we can have a broad philosophical debate on whether social networking is good or evil, but as long as we accept that social networking is a legitimate activity, we should also accept that filters make it better. Now let’s tackle the elephant in the room, which is Google. Suppose I’m so keen on conspiracy theories that my blackboard is larger than Glenn Beck’s. So I believe that 9/11 was an inside job. I believe that Obama is a Kenya-born Muslim, that climate change is a non-issue manufactured by the lamestream media, that the government is hiding the truth about the UFOs and so on. In other words, I’m exactly the kind of guy that Eli is worried about. Furthermore, suppose that I became all of that before the filter bubble set in. In the great age of unfiltered viewpoints that we used to call the era of cable television. So now comes the filter bubble and Google starts personalizing my search results. Instead of seeing generic search results say about 9/11, actually see that some search results have already been endorsed or liked by my friends. In turn, when my friends use Google, they see the links that I visited and I liked as well. Now this is the new mutual exposure, why is it a good thing? Well if you think that all my friends are nut cases like me, then we do have a problem, because [unintelligible] exposure all of us may end up becoming even more paranoid. But let’s leave Charlie Manson and the Unibomber aside for a moment. I don’t think they’re representative of most internet users and their friends. The way Google and Facebook map out our social connections, they try to be very comprehensive. We see links from people we went to school with, our colleagues, our relatives, and so forth. It’s quite likely that many of these people will have radically different positions on 9/11, climate change, Obama’s birthplace, and UFOs. So my point is this, that a link to the report of 9/11 commission that has been endorsed by someone from my social circle, is more trustworthy than a generic Google link that has not passed through a similar social filter. In other words, it’s a possibility that people would now be paying more attention or at least more respect to positions they would otherwise find crazy and conspiratorial, only because their friends are known to endorse those positions. So, to conclude, there are many good concerns about the future of the Internet. That of privacy ranks very high on my personal list, but the filter bubble is not one of them. It’s okay to hate Google and Facebook, but we should hate them for the right reasons. Thank you. "

    "data":"Good evening, everyone. I find myself arguing that the Internet is closing our minds with a bit of regret. This isn't the place that I would want to be, and actually as of a few years ago I would have been arguing the other side, but I've come to believe that the -- well, the Internet is incredibly good at getting groups of likeminded people to get together, think together, work together. But it's actually quite bad at bridging between groups of different people, and that the view that the Internet is exposing us to all sorts of new ways of thinking and new ideas is kind of a dated view, that the Internet's changing, and that there are a few big companies that would like us to hold onto that idea that the Internet is still this kind of open place. So the core of my argument is this, attention is the most valuable commodity out there right now. If you command attention, then you can direct it towards products or services and you can make a lot of money, and that's why all of the big companies on the Internet are trying to figure out what the best strategy is for gathering as much of it as possible. And most of them are focused on the same strategy which is gathering as much data about us as they can and then using that data to give us what they think, what they predict, based on their -- this data and their algorithms, we're going to be interested in. Relevance is the big watchword here. So, you know, if you talk to these companies, if you look at what they're saying, it's very clear that this is a big part of the business plan. Eric Schmidt says, Very soon it will be nearly impossible to see something that has not in some way been tailored to you. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, says, Within the next few years, it'll be anachronistic to visit a website that hasn't been customized to your personal interests in some way. And Facebook is becoming this growing source of how people get their news and how people get their information. So why are they doing this? Well, I think Evgeny actually put it really well. Why does Facebook employ filters? The more they know about us, the more they can make in advertising revenues. And the thing is that these companies aren't blind to the psychology of all this. They've read all of the studies that show that when you present people with information that confirms what they already believed was true, you can actually see these little bursts of pleasure happening in people's brains. And conversely, when people are presented with information that challenges what they believed, they get cranky. That's just the way we're wired. And so if you're a company that's trying to meet stockholder demands and you have this power to present people with information that tends to validate them, why wouldn't you? As a result of this kind of personalization and self selection, we're more likely to see things we agree with and less likely to see things we disagree with. Now, to be clear, I'm not arguing that all personalization is bad. Personalization certainly can have benefits. I'm a Netflix user. But the question is, what are the driving motives behind the kind of personalization that most people use, and what are the effects of that personalization? And I'll argue that because of the motives of these companies, those filters that they're building are going to tend to surround us with information that's agreeable to us and not with information that's uncomfortable. So a few examples of what this looks like in practice, it looks like one person googling Egypt and seeing lots of information about the Arab Spring and another person googling Egypt at the same time and seeing nothing about the Arab Spring. This actually happened, I've got the screenshots on my website. And, you know, I could run through a number of other anecdotes, but actually there's been a study -- the only peer reviewed study I'm aware of on the Google search results and the effects of personalization there -- that shows that 60 percent of the search results on a given front page are usually personalized. Either they're in a different order or they're actually, you know, totally different results based on who Google thinks you are and what it thinks you'll be interested in. So what I think we have to begin to do is to tease apart what the Internet actually does from what we wish it would do or what it possibly could do. And in particular we have to tease apart what's possible to access versus what people do access. For example, now that the -- it's easy now to access the front page of Le Monde or Die Zeit, as it is, in fact to access the New York Times. So you would think, given this vast increase in accessibility of foreign policy, information, of what’s going on in other countries, that people would know more about what’s going on there. In fact that’s not true. According to a Pew study from 2007, people actually were more informed on foreign policy matters before the internet than in 2007. So when Jacob says you can find more sources than ever, it’s kind of beside the point. What’s relevant is that people come into daily contact more frequently, is whether people come into daily contact with more different sources and more particular, different ideological ones. I agree here again with Evgeny who says the regular folk don’t read sites like Global Voices, an aggregator of the most interesting blog posts from all over the world. Instead they are more likely to use the internet to rediscover their own culture and dare we say it, their own national bigotry. So to summarize, big companies are rapidly working to personalize your version of the web. They want to show you what they think you’re going to be interested in. And this isn't passive. This isn’t me turning on Fox News or me turning on -- or picking up a copy of the Nation. This is embedded in an increasing number of websites. Yahoo News in 2007, was a gateway for 80 million people that looked the same. But now, Yahoo runs 13 million different variations of Yahoo News front page every day. And they’re different for each person. It’s hard to even see. We don’t know how tailored our view of the web is because you have to sit down next to someone else and look at the differences. So the object of this personalization is to get us to click more. It’s to get us to like more. And importantly, it’s to get us to click on ads. And there’s little benefit in that world to presenting us with information that makes us uncomfortable, that challenges our views, or that makes us think differently. I don’t think that this has caused the extreme political polarization that we’re seeing right now. But I think it can’t help but exacerbate it. Google says that it’s trying to provide relevance. But what is the most relevant search result when you’re a 9/11 conspiracy theorist googling 9/11? Is it the conspiracy links that Google’s algorithm would tend to promote or is it the Popular Mechanics article that would debunk that stuff? I asked Google this question and they didn’t really have a clear answer. So it’s with regret that I think the Internet is not living up to its potential. The way that most people actually use the thing isn’t to broaden their political perspectives. In fact the path that we generally travel on online will tend to mirror our political views. Thank you.

    "data":"Thank you John. Eli, you can’t have Evgeny. He’s committed to me till at least 8:15. Look, I’ll concede that the internet narrowing our political perspectives is an interesting theoretical problem. People do have a tendency to prefer listening to what they already agree with. And the internet makes it easier in theory for people to live in a solid cystic bubble, where they mostly interact with people who have similar views. But is that a phenomenon that’s getting worse? And if it is getting worse, is it getting worse because of the internet? Eli, and I think Siva, is going to argue that because, they think that because Google and Facebook are bad for us, it must be. But their skepticism about these tools we use every day is kind of the mirror opposite of the cyber utopians who think that new technology only brings us good things. There are a lot of interesting theoretical problems from the Malthusian food scarcity to the Y2K bug, that are just never born out in practice. The Atlantic Magazine gets a cover out of this every month right? Is Google making you stupid? Is Facebook making you lonely? That’s actually the cover this month. Is Twitter destroying your attention span? But cyber realists like Evgeny and me try to look at questions like this in a more empirical way. So what’s the evidence for tonight’s proposition, the internet is narrowing our views. I won’t say there’s none, but I will say it’s laughably weak. And there’s some really good evidence that the web’s doing the opposite of what our opponents claim, that it’s exposing us to a broader range of perspectives and making us less parochial in our outlook. And it’s on that empirical basis and on the basis of your own experience of not becoming more narrow, that you should vote against tonight’s motion. There’s of course some studies about this. There was one a few years ago that showed left and right wing bloggers don’t just talk to their own side. They respond to each other and link to each other a lot, and it’s not all the kind of exchange John cited at the beginning. There's a Pew study from last year that show -- this is a quote, No evidence that social network users, including those who use Facebook, were any more likely to cocoon themselves in social networks of like minded and similar people as some have feared. There's another new Pew study that says that people's social network friendships tend to cross political boundaries. The biggest study which involved 250 million Facebook users, yes, it was sponsored by Facebook, but it was a good study, showed convincingly that most people share links from people they aren't close to. That is, we do reach outside of our personal circles for news. So Eli said at the beginning of his very interesting book that he published last year, that Google was tailoring search results to our politics. He said that on the basis of one anecdote from a friend I don't think he named. He had a similar anecdote tonight about Egypt. Allow me to be skeptical. You can get -- you can do a funky search that gives you weird results at any time of the day for a variety of reasons. But I did a test on this where I asked friends of mine, different parts of the country, different political views, different worlds, to search some parallel, very political loaded terms like climate change. And basically, they got exactly the same thing. And I don't think that there is more than anecdotes to support what Eli is talking about. I've looked at the studies. Now, since Eli wrote his book, Google has changed, and it now includes results from your social network and search returns. So if you're spending all your time on Google Plus, and you're the only people in your circle or Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh, you may in fact see some ideological bias in the returns. But Google added social searching in a way that actually specifically addresses Eli's problem. He had a lot of influence on this. You can turn customization off by pressing the prominent button that says, Hide personal results. And you can toggle back and forth if you're curious about the difference. On Facebook, it's just as easy to turn off customization. You change the sort option on your top stories to most recent. In other words, the filtering they do, these giant sites, is completely transparent and optional. I leave customization on most of the time because a social filter doesn't actually trap you in your own bubble. And take music just as an example I think we can all relate to. The reason I use Spotify, which is a social music service, is that I'm a little bored with the music I already know, and I want to be exposed to stuff I don't know, which I get through my Facebook friends. So back at the level of theory, could an algorithm personalize the news to figure your -- your political perspective? I think it's much harder to do that than it seems. News organizations are really trying to do that. They actually haven't been very successful, which is why, when you go to newyorktimes.com, and I go, we get the same home page. Of course, you can get narrow minded, politically filtered news, but you don't need the internet to do that. You can go to Rush Limbaugh and the radio or FOX or MSNBC on TV. Now, it is worth noting that we did used to have the kind of constricting filter bubble Eli's worried about. And that was the mainstream media before the internet. When I was a kid in the '70s, you found out about the world through TV networks, a couple of news magazines, local newspapers. There weren't any national ones. And it was a very limited range of viewpoints and voices. And if you want to create that kind of filter bubble, all you have to do is remove technologies before television, before radio, before newspapers. So personally, I get a lot of my news these days through a tool called Twitter. I use it as a filter for stories that are relevant to me. And what it does is the opposite of narrowing my perspective. Thanks to Twitter, I'm regularly getting news from global sources as well as American ones. I tune into a lot of really interesting Arab voices during the Arab Spring. I followed China in part through an English translation of Tweets from Ai Weiwei the Chinese artist who's become one of the most important dissidents in the world today. And those filters broaden my perspective. Twitter is a serendipity engine. Finally, I don't think you need to look at all these studies or understand algorithms to make up your mind about tonight's motion. All you have to do is ask yourself a pretty simple question: Has the web narrowed my mind? Has it made me less tolerant of people I disagree with and less interested in what they have today to say? Or has it exposed me to a broader range of voices, sources and ideas than we all used to get when we relied on a consensus oriented mainstream media for all our information? Unless you're convinced that the web makes you narrower, you should vote against tonight's motion. "

    "data":"Thank you very much. Uh so now that you know that I'm both a minister and a lawyer, you know that I'm capable of forgiving you but going on to sue you anyway. Um now what is it, why is it that a church going, Jesus-accepting member of the Christian clergy is on this side of the platform tonight? And the answer really lies in the very carefully worded proposition that is under debate this evening. That America is too damn religious. I don't think there is too much religion in America. Although my own colleagues actually might disagree with that. But I clearly think there's too much of the damnable kind. What is a damned religion? Damned religion is a religion so weak willed and unsure of its own capacity to persuade others to support it or live by its guidance that it seeks the blessing of government. That it seeks financial aid from government. And that it even tries to convert its theological beliefs into legislative fiats. This damned form of religion is a corruption both of faith and of constitutional democracy. And it makes a mockery of the best in our history. It was the fifth United States Congress that unanimously approved the Treaty of Tripoli which unequivocally stated that this was in no way founded as a Christian nation. Thomas Jefferson refused to sign proclamations of prayer or resolutions of thanksgiving, believing how shocking is this, that it should be religious bodies, not governmental ones that decided what days should bring forth the greatest prayer from the American people. And James Madison even objected to the 1790 census form because it had a question merely asking you if you were a member of the clergy. Indeed, throughout most of our American history we've been century. First, religious groups too often, if you will, seek the blessing of government. A few examples. As if the nation were somehow absent private property, now we see public spaces increasingly festooned with more and more religious icons and images, monuments and scriptural citations. Almost always at the behest of the currently statistically most popular religion in America, Christianity. Now I concede that a lot of Americans like it that way. In a December poll for example, seventy eight percent of the respondents said they wanted to moving toward a greater embrace of religious diversity. A greater rejection of the idea that government, federal or state should pick favorites among religions or choose religion over non-religion. By 1960 then presidential aspirant John F. Kennedy addressed a meeting of Southern Baptists concerned about his allegiances as a Roman Catholic, to declare, “I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute.” But what a difference a few decades can make. Now politicians see as much advantage in pandering to religion as the embarrassingly religion seems to gain or try to gain by seeking the assistance of government. So it's a dual corruption, tainting the secular nature of our government and making religious groups special interest supplicants at what is often a quite odoriferous public trough. [APPLAUSE] So let me just briefly go into these uh specifics in these minutes remaining, of how this unholy matrimony kind of plays out in the 21st continue to see nativity scenes outside their local government offices. But curiously in the same poll only fifty three percent said they were actually planning to attend a worship service at Christmas. Is it really good for religion when its adherents in larger numbers would like to catch a quick glimpse of Jesus in a manger, possibly surrounded by a few reindeer and candy canes, rather than actually spend an hour sitting for a religious ceremony. It can't be. Or how about the reasoning used in a constitutional challenge to Ohio's official motto – “With God all things are possible.” The federal appeals court upheld the continued use of the seal, claiming that the phrase had essentially lost its religious significance. There was widespread applause from the religious right. But again to me how can you be happy as a spiritual person when a court notes that the statement that God is both alive and omnipotent is seen as theologically meaningless form overuse. I should note sometimes occasionally legislators also go beyond this. They confuse religion with magic. After every major uh school shooting in the United States, members of Congress insist that if we posted the Ten Commandments on every school room wall we would stop the next violent student uprising from occurring. They're never willing to talk about gun control. They're never willing to even talk about spending money to work with at risk young people but the decalogue display is the panacea. But you know if proximity to holy words really made us better people then the presence of Gideon Bibles in nightstands at motels would have ended adultery long ago and its has not. It is not that simple. Now second, dissatisfied with some powerful symbolic support, some groups even go further and actually want to receive from the public treasury the tax dollars of all of this. Funding. President Bush likes this idea. He created an office of faith based initiatives back in 2001 to get more money for what he called the armies of compassion around America who cared for the poor, the hungry and the homeless. What he forgot to tell us is that government had been partnering with many religious organizations for many decades in this county with just two little caveats. First, any program that got federal money had to forget evangelizing in that program. So that if money went to counseling people suffering from addiction, you had to stick to medical and psychological counseling with those federal dollars and leave the idea of getting right with God to some other separately funded program. Second, it was presumed that you only got tax dollars to provide secular services and that you had to therefore hire the most qualified person for the job regardless of any preference you might wish to give on the basis of religious belief or affiliation. But for the President those caveats were just technicalities. He told an audience in New Orleans just one year before he forgot that the city existed that he saw his program as one that would give funds to groups that are saving Americans one soul at a time. Once again confusing his role as Commander in Chief of that of theologian in chief. He claimed that hiring by faith groups could be done without regard to civil rights laws against discrimination and I find that such an absurd commentary for the early twenty first century. Does anyone think that Baptists or Buddhists or Atheists or Adventists actually ladle the food in a soup kitchen differently? Does it make any difference to you as a person living in a homeless shelter Whether that – uh Adventist has tucked in your bed sheet or an Atheist has done it. Final characteristic of damned religion is the most pernicious. That's where religious groups decide that because they are sure that they have a Biblical understanding of an issue, say the right of reproductive choice, no one will be dared to have another opinion and act on it. That's why they seek things like constitutional amendments to prohibit all abortion. I know that there are people on the other side of this debate who will say that there is great evidence of progressive thinking in churches now and in the past and obviously that's true. But I remind you that Dr. Martin Luther King never created a hundred million dollar dialing for dollars ministry on television. He never endorsed a single candidate from any pulpit in America. He knew that the long arc of justice would reach its goal only when all Americans, black and white, young and old, believer and non-believer, would count on the Constitution as the last great protector of the rights of the people. That's the faith that ought to guide religion in America but regrettably it's the damned kind that seems to get all the attention and have all the clout today. And luckily because I am not running for any elective ...office, I do not have to say at the end of this small speech, God "

    "data":"America is too damn religious. Says who? We could ask our greatest presidential theologian Abraham Lincoln, who references God fourteen times in the four paragraphs of his masterpiece of American political rhetoric, the second inaugural address. We could ask Martin Luther King with the rhythms of cadences and words of Scripture flowing eloquently in his powerful civic sermons. As you listen to that remarkable voice, intoning the words of the prophet Amos, let justice roll down like a mighty river. Close your eyes and utter Amen brother, Amen. King certainly worked to bring theological beliefs into political imperatives. Indeed we could ask the African American community and my distinguished colleague, Professor Roboteau will say more, are you too damn religious? For that community has a long history of bringing religion into civic life. Or, you could consult Dorothy Day of this city. It was awfully damned religious of her to organize tax revolts and protest marches against all manner of injustice as she understood the public implications of her faith. Or Monsignor John Ryan, Father New Deal as he was called. And adviser to FDR who brought Catholic social teaching to questions of economic justice. And how about that FDR? Goes on the radio and offers a prayer on D Day, broadcast to all of America, to the world and to our soldiers on both fronts. Presumably we are not to have any more of that thing, kind of thing. We could ask pro life citizens today, many of whom are called by their faith to oppose abortion and to challenge what they take to be the abuse of state authority to sanction through law, a harrowing practice. I'm assuming most in this room don't agree with their position, but in their protest, I would remind you that they remind us of what free speech and free exercise of religion is all about. Do we really want to put ourselves in the position of authorizing busybodies to say to our preachers and politicians and citizens at every turn you've crossed the line? You're now too damned religious. You're bringing your faith in everywhere and now keeping it safely contained. Tusk tusk. Now we will be likely to hear certain things from our opponents. We may be treated to a rogue's gallery, a line up of religious suspects. Guilty as charged. Fanatics out to steal our liberties and endanger the republic thereby. As I read these sorts of accounts I'm stunned that America has survived. We will be told that it is only the hyper vigilance of those determined to snuff out too damn much religion that has spared us. But the view that we are too damned religious does not pass critical muster. I'm a professor and tempted to be professorial by citing distinguished scholars on church and state, who point out that it is the vigilance of religious citizens to over-extension of state power determined to quash the too damned religious that has over the years, protected the freedoms of us all. Free exercise. Freedom of speech. Freedom of assembly. They haven't done this alone of course but please, I beg you, at this late date don't engage in the shallow exercise of pitting the non-religious who support civil liberties against those with religious commitments who allegedly do not. It flies in the face of the facts. And while we're at it, let's not traffic in the tedious pitting of faith against reason that we hear so frequently. In the long history of Christianity as you heard from from Reverend Lynn, America's dominant faith tradition, the great theologians for centuries explored the entanglement of faith and reason. In my class yesterday at the University of Chicago we discussed Thomas Aquinas with his relentless emphasis on human reason and his definition of human beings as rational, mortal creatures. Of course you will find some who downgraded reason in the overall scheme of things. But you would be hard pressed to find a great theologian who understood faith as nothing but a leap into irrationality. Rather, the challenge was to ask how faith and reason worked together. How we could bring faith and reason to issues of our time. Rather than to assume that they were polar opposites. As to criminal activity, whether committed by the religious or non-religious, ladies and gentlemen we have remedies in law. We are not helpless when confronted by fanatics who commit crimes from whichever direction they come. The problem is that to our opponents, the fanatics tend to come from one direction only. Are we to compare terrible persons and happenings? I dare say that in the twentieth century the anti-religious who thought all religion was damned religion would win hands down. Who can forget that electric moment at the trial of the Nazi war criminal, Adolph Eichmann, when he refused to take an oath on the Bible. He was part of the Nazi inner circle. He would not touch his hand to this book. The story of those despised Israelites and the Christians who effeminized people as the Nazis put it all the time, by trying to keep the strong from destroying the weak which is precisely what they were all about. Now in the history of our republic, confessional pluralism and social and political pluralism go hand in hand. If you think we're too damn religious, you're likely to think we're too damn pluralistic. One of the glories of this country has turned into a liability and a danger thereby. The great French observer of the American democracy, Alexis DeTocqueville, noticed something new under the political sun when he toured these United States. He took account of the way that religious conviction and associational energy and enthusiasm went hand in hand, helping to create a unique, robust, civil society. True then, 1830 – true now As my distinguished colleague, Professor Galston will point out. Ladies and gentlemen, this is New York City. I know you are a tough crowd. [LAUGHTER] I would ask you to listen to the voice of reason from our side. That understands that one should not, from any direction, separate America's citizens who accept a secular world from those, the religious, who allegedly do not. Citizens of religious commitment are among the most enthusiastic supporters of a secular government. They don't want established religion but they also understand that to support a secular government and state does not commit us to a thoroughly secularized society, shorn of religious voices, symbols, activities and commitments. We would be a greatly impoverished country were this to come to pass. So too damn religious? Nope. Just pretty damn American. "

    "data":"This doesn't If the proposition before us tonight was the proposition are Americans too damned religious, I would answer no. In fact I'd be on that side of the table. Um Americans it seems to me, could very well be much more religious than they actually are. If Americans were more religious, I believe, we would have much more social justice in this country. We would have much more of an active welfare state in this country. One of the reasons why European societies have their welfare states, with such extensive social provisions for children and for the elderly and for the helpless, is because they've had Christian Democratic parties that have relied on Christian social teachings to create a society much more caring than our own. If Americans were much more religious there would have been much more pretest against the revelations of torture at Abu Ghraib and other aspects of our foreign policy. For someone to be tortured and hung up like he was being crucifixed would be so unacceptable if Americans were more religious that there would have been massive protests. Not only against the tactics, the illegal torture tactics used by the Bush administration but by the whole war in Iraq would have, which would have violated the social teachings of the single most, largest Christian denomination in the United States, the Catholic church. If Americans were more religious they would listen more to the Pope and his opposition to the war. If Americans were more religious however, if Americans were more religious, America would be much less religious. Our proposition is whether America is too religious and on that question I'm on this side of the fence. Because there's a difference between Americans as individuals and America as a public space and a public society. Now I want to offer [APPLAUSE] I want to offer this proposition as the basis of my remarks. If Americans were more damned religious as opposed to America, the single greatest benefit would be that George W. Bush would never have been elected President of the United States. [APPLAUSE] Why do I say that? Because I believe that the face of the Republican Party, sometimes called the Christian right is much more a political movement than it is a religious movement. And that it has violated the spirit of what it means to be religious in American life and in particular it’s violated the spirit of its own religious tradition. I'm fascinated by one historical figure who I believe to be the single most important American never to have had a full length biography written of him. His name was John Leland. He was a Baptist minister and itinerant preacher in the early 19th century. Uh he wrote in his memoirs, he said I’ve preached in four hundred and thirty six meeting houses, thirty seven courthouses, several capitals, many academies and school house. Barns, tobacco houses, dwelling houses and so on. He estimated that he converted sixteen hundred people to Jesus Christ and he praised Jesus Christ as his savior. We owe to John Leland, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. It was John Leland who engaged in a bargain with James Madison in Virginia that Leland would support Madison as a delegate to the convention that ratified the US Constitution if Madison would drop his previous opposition to a Bill of Rights and support one. James Leland uh John Leland was a Baptist. The Baptists in America under the guise and leadership of people like Roger Williams had been uh uh very, very passionate and devoted advocates of religious liberty in the United States. All that changed in the 1980s. It changed in the 1980s when John Leland's heirs, the Southern Baptist Convention, dropped its long history of commitment to religious liberty to move in a more theocratic direction for explicitly political reasons. I'm sure that almost no one in this room knows that in 1973 when the United States Supreme Court handed down its decision in Roe v Wade, the decision that presumably started the American culture war, the Southern Baptist Convention was fully in support of Roe v Wade. Baptists distrusted the state. They distrusted state intervention. If a state could tell a woman what she could do with her body, it could tell a believer what he or she could do with his or her mind. By 1980s the Southern Baptist Convention had completely changed its position. Repudiated its earlier support and become the major force besides the Catholic Church in America, to overturn Roe v Wade. Now I submit that between 1973 and 1983, God did not change his mind on the question of abortion. But Baptists did. Why did they change their mind? They changed their minds in part because they believed that America had become too decadent a society. But they also changed their minds because they saw an opportunity. The Reagan presidency. The opportunity to exercise political power in America. And they opted for political power and it was the direct result of this change in the Southern Baptist Convention. Our largest Protestant denomination that created the southern Republican Party and that eventually resulted in the election of George W. Bush with the enthusiastic support of people associated with the Southern Baptist Convention. In a democratic society, all the more power to them. They don't like Roe v Wade, all the more power to them. Organize politically. Elect your candidates, change the law. Get new people on the Supreme Court. I am second to none in my admiration for their political success. I don't agree with them, I'm on the other side. But you, I cannot take away the brilliance of their political tactics or the brilliance of the Bush administration in using and relying on that base. But to think that this has anything whatsoever to do with matters of the spirit, matters of the heart or matters of one's relationship to a supreme being strikes me as far too great a stretch. I do not know George W Bush. I do know Bill and Hillary Clinton. I have no idea whether George W Bush in his own heart is a religious man. But in his public persona, he is the least religious President I could ever imagine. A man without a shred of doubt about the wisdom of his policies. A man without a shred of humility and modesty as he faces the difficult challenges brought on, I must say, by his own incompetence. A man filled with public piety but without a conscience. If one could ever imagine, ever imagine George W Bush sitting around with his advisors and thinking about what he's gonna do and Karl Rove comes in and says I know what you gotta do you gotta do this, could you ever imagine George W Bush saying – Karl that's a great idea but I'm sorry, I'm a Christian. The most important word in Christian theology is the word no. There are things that I cannot do because my conscience will not allow it. It's inconceivable to me that that could ever happen. Precisely because the Republican Party has been so successfully political, politically it is incumbent upon people who oppose them to expose their use of religion for political purposes. To protect religion in America against those, the single greatest abusers of religion in America uh the Republican Party, the Christian conservatives and other people who are degrading everything meaningful, serious and spiritual in the tradition that they claim to represent.

    "data":"Good evening. Week after next, Christians, the largest religious group in the nation will begin the season of Lent. A period of prayer and fasting in preparation for Easter. The holiest feast of the Christian year. In that context I recall the voice of Isiah speaking in the name of the Lord. Is not this the fast that I choose to loose the bonds of injustice? To undo the thongs of the yolk. To let the oppressed go free and to break every yolk. Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house? When you see the naked, to cover them. And not to hide your self from your own flesh and blood. In a land of super-abundance and obscene excess, a land of economic inequality and serious levels of intransigent poverty and homelessness, can we hear the voice of Isiah and really claim that we in our nation are too religious? When we tally up our church attending statistics, and the large number of Americans who believe in God, do we remember the words of Amos, again speaking in the name of the Lord. I hate, I despise your festivals and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies. But let justice roll down like the waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. By Amos' standard of justice enacted equitably for rich and poor alike, can we really claim that we are too religious? Mired down in a preemptive war that has cost thousands upon thousands of lives with no end in sight. Can we listen to the prophecy of Micah, they shall beat their swords into plough shares and their spears into pruning hooks. A nation shall not lift up sword against nation. Neither shall they study war anymore. Can we listen to these words without a pang of remorse that our efforts to build peace and have been so feeble and so ineffectual. Do we observe the commandments delivered in the sermon on the mount. Do not resist evil-doers. If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also. Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you. No one can serve two masters, you cannot serve God and Mammon. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink or what you will wear. Do not judge, lest you be judged. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect. Do we obey the singular new commandment proclaimed in John's gospel? Love one another as I have loved you. By this shall all know that you are my disciples by how you love another. A love in action, not just words. Feed the hungry. Give drink to the thirsty. Welcome the stranger. Clothe the naked. Tend to the sick. Visit those in prison. For when you do these things to the least among you, you do them to Christ. The prophetic strain in the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures has down through the ages constantly challenged religious communities to focus on the one thing necessary. What the prophets articulate in word and gesture and in the case of Christ literally in body according to Christian belief, is the divine pathos, to use Abraham Joshua Heschel's wonderful term. God's compassionate concern for the plight of human kind. Especially for the weak, the outcast, the widow, the sojourner. The prophet experiences the divine pathos as a fire in the bones, compelling him or her to speak and act. In twentieth century America an amazing network of religious activists carried on this prophetic tradition. Dorothy Day, co- founder of the Catholic Worker Movement, established houses of hospitality to feed, clothe and shelter the indigent. Based on the belief in our personal responsibility to live in solidarity with the poor. AJ Musty, non-violent agitator and labor organizer, longtime director of the Fellowship of Reconciliation taught that suffering in the cause of justice releases God's presence into the stream of human history. Abraham Joshua Heschel applied the concept of divine pathos to the modern struggle for social justice. As he marched with King from Selma to Montgomery and organized active protests against the Vietnam War. Howard Thurman, preacher, ecumenist and mystic, co-pastored the first interracial and inter-faith congregation in the nation. And spent a lifetime teaching that the search for community is part of the very structure of our being. Thomas Merton, Catholic contemplative monk wrote compellingly about the necessity of solitude, silence and simplicity for discovering our true selves, beyond the false persona fed by the consumerism of our mass society. Martin Luther King Junior deeply rooted in the black religious tradition of suffering Christianity arising out of slavery, confronted racial and economic inequality and argued that we have to transform America from a thing oriented to a person oriented society, lest we succumb to the giant triplets of racism, materialism and militarism that continue to afflict us. If we heed the voices of these modern prophets and their ancient predecessors, we won't conclude that Americans or America are too religious. If we take heed we will see how often we preach religion while practicing consumerist, conspicuous consumption. How often we turn piety into another form of ego gratification. Useful for comforting the comfortable and empowering the powerful. We will see how easy and seductive it has always been to blunt the prophetic drive of religion to radically change our lives and our society. We will see that we are not nearly religious enough. "

    "data":"I am not an ordained minister or a rabbi. So it seems I am here to speak to you tonight in the role of the atheist in the room. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Since these are Oxford rules I'm just going to pretend this is the Oxford Union and say that America is too bloody religious. Now the case for God's country is being made in great Biblical language and the scholarly language of Princeton, the University of Chicago and soon to come that might fortress of religion, the Brookings Institution. [LAUGHTER] Uh but ladies and gentlemen let us step down from the ivory tower and the church steeple into what one of President Bush's advisors famously called the reality based world. Down here in the reality based world, we must first talk about the retrograde form of religion that holds one third of Americans in thrall. This is the proportion of Americans who say that they believe every word in the Bible is literally true. Not merely inspired by God but the literal handwriting of God. One out of three. What an astounding statistic. Reflecting a level of credulity that exists nowhere else in the developed world. The widespread persistence of such an anti-diluvian form of faith is a true affliction in American society and demonstrates alas, that the liberty of conscience guaranteed by our Constitution also leaves us the liberty to bind ourselves with the chains of unreason. Our opponents would have you believe that those of us who consider America too bloody religious are concerned mainly with legalistic issues involving the separation of church and state. In fact our nation's excessive religiosity affects individual lives and public policy in ways that are often matters of life and death. I could offer two hours worth of examples or eight hours but mindful of the clock, here are just two. First, consider that the United States is the only country in the Western world with the death penalty. Every study of this issue has shown that pro death penalty views correlate closely with biblically based religious beliefs. Justice Antonin Scalia, a Roman Catholic so far to the right that he is at odds with his own church on the issue, more Catholic than the Pope you might say – believes that since all legitimate governmental power is derived from God and God has the power of life and death, so too must governments. In a 2002 speech Scalia quoted Paul's famous epistle to the Romans about government heads being duly designated ministers of God to avenge evil. Then Scalia noted nostalgically and I quote – “few doubted the morality of the death penalty in an age that believed in the divine right of kings.” Well yes those were surely the good old days. [LAUGHTER] And doesn't it say something about our excessive respect for religion in America that this is considered a perfectly respectable position. Scalia, after all, is a Supreme Court justice but I can assure you can find his sentiments in less elevated English on every crack pot right wing web site. Let us consider another very different example. The United States has the highest rate of teen pregnancy and one of the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases among teenagers again in the developed world, why? Not because American teenagers are more sexually active than any other but because conservative religious believers have blocked sensible sex education programs and have made it as difficult as possible for teenagers to obtain contraceptives. Just recently, we learned that the man in charge of the only federal birth control program for the poor, one Dr. Eric Keroack spends much of his time appearing at religiously sponsored abstinence conferences, where he promotes the notion that premarital sex ruins your chances for lasting marriage because too much sex makes you lose too much oxytocin. The hormone of pleasurable intimacy released with every orgasm. [LAUGHTER] Too many orgasms and there go your precious bodily fluids for the rest of your life. [LAUGHTER] It seems that Dr. Keroack is a disciple not of the Lord, but of General Jack D. Ripper from the movie Doctor Strangelove. [LAUGHTER] Uh this would be funny if our tax dollars were not paying this lunatic to peddle his nutty combination of right wing faith and junk science. Now – [APPLAUSE]. What of the majority of Americans who are the kind of religious believers who have made room for secular knowledge in their house of faith. Martin Luther King has been very much on my mind recently too. Because it’s been forty years since he made his courageous speech denouncing the Vietnam War at the Riverside Church. Some of you were probably there. The most important points to be made here are that Dr. King, both on civil rights and the war, was speaking truth to power from outside the government. And he was speaking to a morality that transcended every religion and was in direct opposition to the religious beliefs of many Americans at the time. It is utterly nauseating to hear representatives of the religious right today, cloak themselves in Dr. King's mantle when their spiritual ancestors were standing in the school house door and waving Bibles in support of segregation. [APPLAUSE] So if you're going to talk about religion and all the good it can do in society, you also have to talk about religion and all the bad it can do and not pretend that bad religion is somewhere out there and has nothing to do at all with good religion. Our opponents suggest that reasonable religion does have nothing to do with extremist religion. But there are a great many more people of unreasonable faith in this country than sophisticated experts on theology would like to believe. And would like you to believe. Barry Lynn has mentioned attempts to inject intelligent design in our schools. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. On October 30th, 2005, the Pew Forum on Religion in Public Life released the results of an opinion poll that was ignored in the press because Hurricane Katrina had slammed into the Gulf Coast the day before. Among the findings, two thirds of Americans want both evolution and creationism to be taught in public schools. Fewer than half of Americans accept any form of evolution, including evolution guided by God by the way. Finally, an astonishing forty two percent say that all living beings have existed in their present form since the beginning of time. These religiously based beliefs are an intellectual disaster for our country. Americans of all faiths have confused the freedom of religion in our Constitution, which allows people to believe whatever they want, with the respect for the beliefs themselves. Last fall in a lecture at a church affiliated college in the South, I said that I do not respect the belief that the universe was created in seven days. Even though of course I respect any one's right to believe that. A very polite young woman came up to me afterward and said that she was an evangelical Christian and was personally insulted by my saying that I didn't respect her beliefs about Creation. I asked her if she genuinely respected --my atheism and she admitted that she didn't. But she said she did feel sorry for me. She also told me she wanted to be a high school teacher because she, but she wasn't going to become one because she was sure she would prevented from bearing witness to her faith. I suggested that she wait and indulge in some free inquiry before she made such a decision at age eighteen. I can't do that she said. With the accent on can't. There's no better idea than the truth. This was a young mind in faith based chains in the 21st century in a nation whose Constitution was written by men of the Enlightenment. It is this young woman and millions of young women and men like her who represented the tragedy of Americans overly deferential toward religion. What we need in this country is not more faith of any kind but a new age of reason. Thank you. "

    "data":"The topic before us is one that stirs understandable passions. And as if the topic weren't enough uh our worthy opponents are doing their best to pour gas on the flames. But I'd like to proceed somewhat differently. Uh I'd like to appeal if I may to your reason. To your fair mindedness and to your sense of our shared national history not the myopia of the moment. Let me tell you what this debate is not about. It's not about whether you have to be religious to be a good American. Of course you don't. Nor it is about whether you approve of the way that the most intense elements of the Republican coalition speaking in the name of religion, have conducted themselves. As a lifelong activist Democrat I sure don't. Neither do most Americans and obviously neither do you. Nor finally is it about whether religion in America is without excess or without sin. Of course it isn't for the simple reason it is a human institution. Here I believe is the real question. If you believe America is too religious, you must believe that we'd be a better country if we were less religious or maybe not religious at all. That's the proposition I'd like to contest. Now, admittedly this isn't an easy argument or inquiry to conduct. It's rather like asking whether Bedford Falls would have been better or a better place without George Bailey. Well quite obviously I'm no angel and I'm certainly not Frank Capra but I'm gonna do my best to persuade you. Invoking your reason, your fair mindedness and your sense of history, that America is better off with the religion it has with all its flaws than without it. I want to make three simple point, points. First of all, from the very beginning of our history, religious Americans have been at the forefront of most if not all of the turning points in our history. Consider the Revolutionary War, where for ten years prior to our Declaration of Independence, Protestant ministers from the pulpit, were teaching the lessons of liberty. And so when Thomas Jefferson came to draft the Declaration of Independence, he didn't have to make up a new theory. He only had to do what he said he did years later in a letter to a friend, to state the plain common sense of the American mind. Or consider the anti-slavery movement. First in England and then in the United States, religious Americans were in the lead. After the Civil War with the rise of industrial capitalist, the teachers of the social gospel spearheaded progressive reform. They were at the forefront of concern for immigrants and for the poor. As Professor Elshtain has already pointed out. In the 1920s the Catholic church engaged with organized labor and its leading intellectuals and theologians set the stage for the New Deal. In the 1950s and 1960s, the civil rights movement of course. Uh but the anti-war movement, the anti-Vietnam war movement was fueled and sustained among other things by religious passions. Today, movements to fight AIDS, famine and genocide are led by Americans of faith. Last year I had the privilege of attending a rally on the Washington Mall against our government's inaction in Darfur. And I can tell you if you took the religious people out of that crowd, there would hardly have been anyone left. Here’s my second point. Religious Americans are among our most engaged citizens today and their engagement strengthens our community. I'm not gonna deluge you with statistics. But I can tell you this – religious Americans are far more likely than non-religious Americans to give to charitable causes and that includes non-religious causes. Religious Americans are far more likely to volunteer than are non-religious Americans and that includes for non-religious causes. Religious Americans are far more likely to participate in our nation's politics. To follow it closely. To attend political meetings. To join local reform groups. To contact elected officials and even to vote than are non-religious Americans. And all of these generalizations hold true after one corrects for income, marital status and all the other variables that social scientists like to play with. Here's my third point – religious Americans, unlike what you have heard from our worthy opponents are not, repeat not a threat to our liberties. An overwhelming majority of religious Americans practice what one eminent scholar has termed a private faith. It is private rather than public. Tolerant and inclusive, moderate than extreme and above all, non-judgmental. These are not simple social science abstractions. If you don't believe me, look at the Terry Schiavo affair. Strident voices in the Republican base said go for it. The Republican Congressional leaders went for it. President Bush even flew back from Crawford, interrupting for one of the few times in his Presidency a vacation. And then what happened? These folks were stunned to find that they had a genuine public revolt on their hands. Including a revolt of a majority of religious Americans who considered what the government was doing meddling and intrusive, a violation of family privacy and abuse of law to limit our personal freedoms. And so my friends, to sum up, religious Americans have been at the forefront of progressive change throughout our history. They strengthen our society and our politics today and they do not strengthen – they do not threaten, indeed they reinforce our tradition of liberty. Now, if you've followed me on this journey I'll hope, I hope you'll agree that just as George Bailey in normal, ennobled Bedford Falls – so religious Americans with all their flaws have ennobled our country. But my guess is that many of you remain unconvinced. What about the shrill voices, the calls for a Christian America? Jerry Falwell's lunatic rantings? Well of this and more is true. But every movement, secular and religious has its extremists. Those with tunnel vision and an absolute conviction of their own rectitude who will brook no compromise. Let me ask you – who among you would wish to be judged in accordance with the most extreme version of the faith or beliefs you profess? To judge fairly you must look at the full picture, not the fringe. And if you do, I'm confident that you will conclude that America is not too damm religious after all. "

    "data":"It's a pleasure to be here. Last time I did IQ Squared in London, I actually laughed so hard during the debate, I pulled a muscle on stage. I will endeavor to be more restrained this evening. I also notice that it's impossible they didn't give me a glass of wine. In London you could actually drink wine will you did the debate. So let me just say, one, it's an honor to be here with Daniel Pipes. I read Daniel's dissertation -- I think it was over 30 years ago now -- on slave soldiers, which actually is a very important and unappreciated part of Islamic history. Daniel and I have actually debated this issue years ago, when a little book I put out called Islamic Paradox came out. So it's good to be here with him again. And let me sort of restate the resolution. I think what Daniel and Zuhdi are really saying is that better dictatorship forever than allow the Muslim common man, woman to elect Islamists in a free vote. Now, that's a pretty, I think, ironic position for them to take, because what they're essentially saying is they want to perpetuate the political systems which have allowed Islamic fundamentalism, including its most radical offshoots, jihadism, most famously al-Qaida, to actually grow stronger. It is no accident that Islamic radicalism has grown enormously during the period of dictatorship, secular dictatorship, throughout much of the region. It has been jet fuel for that cause. The societies that have been ruled by dictators and kings with ever coarsening, I think, rigor have very -- have harmed their societies, have caused, more or less, an ethical collapse. I mean, a good personal anecdote of this is when I was in Cairo and I was a student there at the American University of Cairo in 1980. I can say that not a single woman at that school was veiled. And that was a good thing, because they were babes. I mean, they were hot. I've never seen so many beautiful women in one spot. And 20 years later, I think it's fair to say, under Mubarak, that probably 20 percent, or even more maybe, were veiled. Now, why is it the social composition of that school hasn't changed at all, these are women of the elite. Why would women of the elite actually start veiling themselves? Because they should be the ones who should embrace the dictatorship because it has allowed them certain social liberties that would not exist under an Islamist system. I think the answer to that is that they were protesting. They were protesting the political order. They were protesting the social order. They were protesting the ethical order, that it had become disgusting. And I think if you -- it's interesting to then- to look North and look at where, I think, Daniel, and perhaps Zuhdi too, would once upon a time have said were the best hope for the Islamic world, and that would be Turkey. All right? Because Turkey really had the model that everybody in the foreign policy community on the left and the right really liked. That was the model that you would have enlightened dictatorship. You have someone like Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. He would come in and, through force of arms, literally, change the society, create the social basis for a more liberal order, and, boom, down the pike you would have liberal democracy. Now, guess what's happened in Turkey? You haven't seen the triumph, actually, of liberals yet in the ballot box. For the last almost 10 years, you've seen the Islamist party win. As the elections became ever freer, as the generals moved off, guess who became the dominant party, the AKP, the Justice and Development Party, which is an Islamist -- I think Daniel would call it an Islamist party. So what that ought to tell you is that under no circumstances are you going to create a liberal order in the Middle East without bringing along the faithful. You cannot have a dictatorship who will take the traditions of the past and will take the ulama, the religious scholars, and throw them in the dust bin or throw them in jail. The only way you're going to get a more liberal order in the Middle East is through people of faith. It is through the fundamentalists participating in the system that you're actually going to develop the jousting ethic that is going to allow liberals to have greater chances. It's only through them participating that you're going to have people become responsible for politics. Now, Daniel – another good book that Daniel wrote was actually about conspiracy. And if all those who know the Middle East at all, you know that the Middle East is hobbled by conspiracy. It's known as toovtdie [spelled phonetically]. In Persian, they call it toovtdie jewy conspiracy mongering, searching for conspiracies. It is literally, as Daniel would tell you, it's a cancer on society. Now, why do they have that? They have that because the political order is dictatorial.  It is what -- everything that is important that happens happens, as the Iranians say, pushte powde [spelled phonetically], it happens behind the curtain. Only by people becoming responsible, by having, as they say in the Arabic and in Persian, masuliat [spelled phonetically], can you drive away conspiracy, can you create a more healthy order. There's no way you can have that under dictatorship. You are always going to have dependent people. You're always going to have people who are ridden with conspiracy. So if you want to create that order, perpetuate that order, what Daniel is in fact saying is he's going to create an order, there's going to be more conspiracy. It is you have to bring in some type of Democratic system and allow these people to evolve. And they might also say evolution is not possible with Islamists. Well, we know, at least looking in the case of Iran -- and we don't know yet what's going to happen in the Arab world. We don't know what's going to happen in Egypt. We don't know what's going to happen in Tunisia. But we can tell that in Iraq under a theocracy, under a dictatorship, there has been a profound change that you have fallen revolutionaries everywhere. I do not have time to go into the number of them, but it is an ocean. It is a tidal wave of people who were once hard core Islamists who have abandoned the faith or who have evolved their faith and have become pretty profound Democrats, if not liberals. They still exist in the dictatorial society. But they are -- you have seen the explosions in 2007. You saw them in 2009. You saw it in 1997, Mohammed Akbi [spelled phonetically]. So I suggest to you if you want to see evolution, you cannot be in favor of -- create a dictatorship which can only promise you stagnation. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you, John. And let me return the compliment to Reuel. I learned much from his books on Iran and particularly the book that was alluded to before his entry, his smuggling -- being smuggled into Iran. He has certainly got us off to a rousing start. Now, the good news, ladies and gentlemen, is that we basically agree on the fundamentals. None of us like dictators. We all want liberal democracy. None of us like conspiracy theories. So the question is not one of principle. The question is really one more of tactics. How do we achieve liberal democracy in the Middle East? And as you've just heard, the argument for elected Islamists is that this flushes out the system, and you have responsibility, and you have progress. I will argue the opposite case, not because I'm against responsibility and progress but because I think that the Islamists, whether elected or not, whether violent or not, Islamists of any sort whatsoever are barbarians, are totalitarians, are far worse than dictators. You're not going to look to me to find an apologetics for dictators. They're execrable, they're horrible, they're brutal, they're miserable. But the Islamists, elected or not, are even worse. One can distinguish between those dictators who are greedy. In fact, Robert Rosenkranz used that very word before. They're greedy. They're interested in their own welfare. They have huge amounts of money stored away. They invite Mariah Carey in to sing their birthday song. They keep pet lions in their backyard. They have lots of cars and planes. It's the good life. They're greedy. And in the pursuit of this greedy goal, they are going to harm you if you get in their way. But if you don't get in their way, they'll leave you alone. They don't have a vision. They don't particularly cooperate with each other. And they often do cooperate with us because they don't have any particular hostility towards us so long as we don't get in their way. Now, that's bad. There's no apology from me on that. But the ideological dictators, be they fascist, communist or Islamist are far worse because they wish to impose their vision. They wish to create a global hegemonic state, in this case, Caliphate, another case, an international communist state or Nazi state. They have a vision for the new human being who they will redo. And if you get in their way, they will -- even if you don't get in their way, if you disagree with them, they will be brutal with you. And if dictators are bad and kill thousands, ideological dictators, Nazis, communists and Islamists kill millions and even tens of millions, tens of millions. Mao, Stalin, Saddam Hussein and so forth. These are people with a vision how they're going to change society. So I argue that we're better off with plain old greedy dictators who can evolve, who do evolve if they're pushed, who are not that terrible to their population, who we can work with. We're far better off with them than we are with the ideological ones. So in short, the motion that's before us, Better -- if you agree with this motion, Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators, you are in effect saying that you also agree with the idea that the motion, Better Elected Nazis Than Dictators.” Adolph Hitler was elected, was he not? These are the same people. These are totalitarianists. These are people who will limit freedom for a much longer period of time. Now, it's true, as Reuel pointed out, that in 1980, one did not see the Islamist surge in Egypt that one does today. No question. And I agree with him that the dictatorship was part of it. I wish that our government and other Western governments had pushed Hosni Mubarak to open up. And I believe we could have had a quite different outcome had we done so. We were irresponsible in being his colluders, his accomplices. We should have been pushing towards civil society. We should have been pushing towards voting and freedom of expression and minority rights and independent judiciary and loyal opposition. We should have been doing all those things, and we didn't. And thus we have the terrible results we have. So my first premise, my first guideline for American policy is always deal with dictators and push them in the right direction towards an open society. Secondly, always support our friends. We do have friends. We do have people who agree with us. Be they the demonstrators in Iran in June of 2009 who were against the dictatorship of the Mullahs or the people in Tahrir Square last year who were against Mubarak. If you listen to them, they're in favor of the things we have. They want democracy. They want civil society. They want responsibility. And it is our burden not only to help them materially but to help them morally, to work with them, to always, always help them. Even though they're far from the corridors of power and will not achieve -- will not reach rule any time soon, they are the hope for the Middle East. They are the ones who can pull the region out of its current mire, and we must always support them. So one, work with dictators, but push them towards civil society and democracy. Two, always help the liberal elements. And three, always, always, always oppose the Islamists. They are our worst enemy. And whenever they come in, they are our enemy, and they are the enemy of the subjects that they rule over. And Reuel mentioned Turkey. Yeah, Turkey has become Islamist, as he mentioned. For the last 10 years, one sees a Turkey which was always imperfect under the other parties, has under the AKP become far more dictatorial than it had been for, far more hostile in its foreign relations with state actors, states on its peripheries, has the largest number of journalists in the world that are in jail and the like. So in short, if we want to get to liberal democracy, which we all agree upon, the thing to do is to work with the dictators and improve the dictators and slam the door on the totalitarians and the ideological dictators. Work with the greedy dictators and slam the door on the ideological dictators who will put the region into even worse shape than it is today. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you. It's really great to be here tonight, and I can promise in this debate we're not going to talk about the debt, I'm not going to talk about my grandmother, I'm not going to talk about your tax rates, we've got a really juicy topic. And I'm going to break it down into three main points, why you should vote in favor of the proposition and not against us. Number one, no dictatorship can maintain the status quo that we see in the Middle East right now. A vote for the proposition would be a vote to accept reality. A vote against the proposition is a vote to stick your headiu in the sand. Although I suspect much of the debate tonight will focus on the Middle East and North Africa, it's important to note that this region of the world actually represents a minority in the vast Muslim world. It's about 20 percent of the entire population of Muslims in the world. Six in 10 Muslims actually live in the Asia-Pacific region. Muslim majority countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have activist Islamist political parties and systems that work. So the debate over whether Islam and democracy is compatible is the persistent charm of an irrelevant question, one that's no longer relevant. In the Middle East right now we're in the very early stages of a transition that I think will last for years. And a year and a half into these uprisings we've only seen four leaders fall out of about 19 or 20, depending how you add them up. And you've seen only serious infighting in the five or six countries, but you look at the crushing demographic political and economic conditions that these countries face, no dictator can hold that back. And I think you look at the political dynamics in places like Egypt and Tunisia, it's quite natural to see why Islamists did very well for reasons that were well explained. They were suppressed, and the debates in these societies were pushed to the dark corners of the mosques. And that debate was radicalized, and, yes, there is a threat from radicalized Islam. But it is the consequence of dictatorships, the very thing that if you vote against the proposition you will be voting in favor of that and continuing that sort of system. It's simply not sustainable. Number two, elected Islamists will change in response to the politics. And I think tonight we'll talk a lot about statements that elected Islamists will say. What I'm focused on are the people, and I lived over there, and I understand that the basic needs, basic security, jobs, and other things will drive politics, maybe not in the early stages, maybe when things get a little rough they'll be a little ideological, but, by and large, Islamist politicians will be politicians, and we will need to support this long effort to actually push them to face the same pressures and constraints that other politicians face around the world. And the open debates that we have like the open debate we're having here tonight in Intelligence Squared, I think this forum is phenomenal. I've watched it now a number of times. And these sorts of open debates expose the voices of fear, expose the voices of hatred and demonization in ways that I think clarify. And this is what these societies in the Middle East are just starting to experience. So, again, a vote for the proposition is a vote for the possibility of change in these societies. A vote against it, it's for the status quo, which, as we said, is unsustainable and has harmed us. Now, I hope we get into this debate over a liberal democracy. You talked about it a little bit early on. And certainly we shouldn't be naïve. There's a very real risk that if we simplistically define democracy as the ballot box and going to the ballot box, you could see Christian minorities, other religious minorities, women see their rights suffer. But my argument, again, against that and against the arguments of one man, one vote, one time, which is often brought up, is that that threat in the context of this debate tonight, the proposition you have to vote for or against, there's an inherent contradiction there, because if the biggest threat resulting from elected Islamists is a dictatorship that imposes upon the human rights and basic rights of individuals, you've got a dictatorship. So at the core of the argument of our opponents tonight is that contradiction we need to deal with. Third point, elected Islamists, not dictators, will defeat the radical ideologies of groups like al-Qaida. Now, I think we've done a damn good job over the last three or four years going after al-Qaida, and I know that's a debatable proposition among a lot of people. But I think the targeted strikes and other things, that's a separate debate, which I hope Intelligence Squared has. But if you look at what's going on ideologically in the battle of ideas, al-Qaida, over the last three decades, essentially, has tried to build its ideological platform on two core pillars. Number one, tapping the popular discontent with dictators. Number two, anti-Americanism. That's a combustible mix, and breaking that, and having the people in the region break that, I think, is extremely powerful. The fact that al-Qaida and its affiliates had virtually nothing with the removal of leaders in places like Egypt and Tunisia and the widespread calls for political reform and the battles that are still going, I think, is telling. The fact that Ayman Zawahiri, the head of al-Qaida, wrote a book attacking the Muslim Brotherhood for actually participating in democratic politics is telling. Looking ahead, it seems that al-Qaida's popular appeal, I think, will remain low, given that many of the protesters are out there supporting democratic reforms. People are going to the ballot box, the very thing that radical jihadists are opposed to. So I'm going to close up here. I must say that we're faced with a great opportunity here. The popular uprisings in the Middle East. And, again, we'll probably focus on that, because it's the hot topic, and it's the most uncertain, and Reuel and I agree that there's no clear path forward. And I think we're probably going to have a couple of steps back. We're going to see these countries fight with this all along. But tonight, if you vote against this motion, your vote is essentially saying -- remember those good old days when Muammar Gaddafi was in power in Libya? Remember those good old days? Remember when he repressed and killed thousands of his own citizens, when he actually used the veil of Islamism at different times and passed laws in the name of Islam to try to establish his credibility? Remember Muammar Gaddafi used terrorists who actually bombed airlines and killed hundreds of Americans around the world, setting off the sorts of things that I think we're debating here tonight. Remember that? Then vote against the proposition. A vote for the proposition, is it a clear, certain proposition that we're going to see liberal democracy appear? I can't guarantee you that. But I actually think it's a better pathway forward than sticking with dictatorships. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you, John. It's a privilege and honor to be here. And thank you, Mr. Rosenkranz, for your vision and this wonderful platform. Daniel covered the history and the choices before us in the Middle East. I'll give you a deeper, more personal analysis of, really, one of the terms that I think has been thrown around here quite a bit, but, yet, it doesn't seem that our opposition understands, which is Islamism. And this motion, I cannot tell you enough, as a Muslim and as an American, how important it is that we not get this wrong, because we're sitting right now at a tipping point in the Middle East, and if we get this wrong and we start to think, Well, the Islamists are better than the dictators, we're going to then usher in even worse totalitarianism and dictatorship. You know, one of the old sayings was that hope springs eternal. And certainly one of the American concepts we've always had is that we want to be hopeful; we want to see progress. But I'll tell you, as a Muslim, I'm insulted at people who believe that Islamism is progress for me as a Muslim, that somehow the theocrats and those with robes that memorize their scripture, that somehow know how to run democracy, when, in fact, it's an illusion. I think one of the things our opposition hasn't even begun to tell you is how they can trust one word that the Islamists tell them. They're deceptive theocrats who will do anything to monopolize and control our societies. And I think one of the things our opposition seems to be doing -- and if you vote for this motion, you'd be basically voting for the fact that, somehow, they want you to believe that we support dictators. And that's not why I'm on this side. I'm on this side of this equation because Islamists are not better than dictators, because we have been sentenced to two evils in the Middle East: Islamic fascism and secular fascism. They both supported one another. They fed off one another. They're one and the same. And for our opposition to tell you that, somehow, boom, the dictators exit stage left, and what you're left with is a spring that you can plant new plants and soil, and somehow that the Islamists, that somehow they come out of reform, is just hogwash. The Islamists are a product of dictatorship, as, actually, they said. So now, all of a sudden, we're going to put our hope for reform into not only people the people that came out of that environment, but people that have thrived in monopolizing and feeding off of a dictatorial mindset. But add one more very important component, a sense that they have a mandate from God, a sense that they know our faith. They know Islam, and they know how to put into place Sharia or Islamic law, and they will do it not only for their country, they'll do it for the 56 other countries in the OIC, the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation, and they'll thus do it for the world. This is far more dangerous than a simple dictator. So you need to understand what Islamism is if you're going to vote for or against this motion. And once you understand that Islamism is no different than what our Founding Fathers fought against when we fought against theocracy in this country, you'll realize that fighting against theocracy is the only way to achieve liberty. And I as a Muslim who loves my faith and loves my scripture, if I want to see our societies -- I mean, listen, my family fought against dictatorship in Syria. We understand what it is. And you see it today with over 30,000 killed and hundreds of thousands of displaced. But American influence -- please don't underestimate the influence that America can have if we try to tip this equation one way or the other. And if you believe that there's a third pathway for Muslims and for all those minorities and women and others in the Middle East, then you must vote against this motion. You must vote that Islamists are not better than dictators. They come from the same cloth. And Islamists actually -- actually are dictators on steroids. You know, ultimately, I think we have to remember that if you're going to vote with the opposition for this motion, you're going to believe that somehow you can have hope with Islamists. Forget what they say, forget what they believe. Forget what the mantra is of the Muslim Brotherhood. Forget what they are saying from their pulpits, what they are saying from the government. Forget that the OIC just last week gave us directions on how to deal with our own First Amendment that it's too critical of Islam and Muslims. Forget the fact that women have less and less rights the more the clerics get in control. Forget the fact that the minorities are ousted, the fact that the Jewish population and Coptics and others, the more Islamists get in control, the more minorities vacate the premises in those countries. Somehow we need to divorce ourselves from the reality of what Islamists do and say that they're a gateway into a future of hope for the Middle East. That's certainly not a gate that I want to walk through. And it's certainly, I don't think, a gate that the people that are giving their lives in the Arab revolutions, in the Arab Spring, which are really just convulsions against dictators, the people that are marching on the streets are not doing that to be handed over to Islamists. And if they did -- if you vote for this motion, you are basically telling them that, okay, this dictator, this theocrat, because he uses religious language, is better for you. And we're going to help them. And by the way, if you believe in American credibility and soft power, American soft power in the Middle East is lower than it's ever been. The reason Secretary Clinton had tomatoes thrown at her car a few months ago was because the people of the Arab Spring saw us helping out the Brotherhood, saw us basically cozying up to the Islamists. And the Islamists did not win that election. They only got 25 percent of the vote, and then there was a runoff. So remember the elections, that's the other part of this motion. We have to also look at what it means to be elected. The non-Islamists are divided into so many parties that the majority, 75 percent of Egypt and a majority of Tunisians did not vote with the Islamists the first time around. But then when a runoff happened, they ended up voting between the Islamists or the old dictators, and they wanted some kind of change shall and they ended up voting for the Islamists. So that's the other thing is, if you want to resign them to just two choices, both of which none of us want, I think ultimately you must vote for. If you want to give them a third choice, a third path, that being of liberty, I believe you should vote against. And you'll not see the Egypt Islamist President Morsi, for example, criticizing terrorist groups like Hamas or Iran or Saudi Arabia, even though he may give flowery language of parliamentary democracies and talking about women's rights, et cetera. But yet when push comes to shove -- just a few years ago, he was a truther, a conspiracy theorist. Just a few years ago -- and just actually a few months ago, he's already met with the heads of Hamas and other radical Islamists. So this is a guy who's consolidating his power, not only in Egypt, but globally. Islamism is what pushes him to consolidate power globally. And I think this is why you should vote against the motion. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you. I want to express my deepest gratitude to Mr. Rosenkranz and the Intelligence Squared forum for allowing me to speak tonight alongside such well-known and far more distinguished co-panelists. This is particularly an honor for me because, let’s be honest, I haven’t written a book, I’m not a regular on national T.V. or radio. What I have is my story. I am a Muslim American woman born and raised in Toledo, Ohio by two very loving Indian Muslim parents. My sister, brother, and I were raised in a middle-class American home. We went to Mosque on Sundays, attended Sunday school classes, and prayed the community prayer with our community of Pakistanis, Lebanese, and Syrian Muslims. When I was in high school, our Mosque president was a woman, who did not wear a headscarf. And it may come as a surprise to some of you, but for the entirety of my life men and women have prayed side by side at our Mosque, and both can enter the prayer hall using the same door. My parents are both very religious people, but they express their faith in different ways. My father emphasizes the devotional, and he tends to spend his time praying and reciting the Koran, whereas my mother emphasized the more constructive approach. She uses community service and volunteering to express hers. But what they both share is fundamental Islamic principles. First and foremost, seek knowledge. They urged their children, all three of us, to question, to have critical minds, and to doubt. They wanted us to engage fully with our faith and to question everything. They lived out the Koranic commandments that there is no compulsion in religion, and also that God said, in the Koran, “I made you into many tribes so that you might know one another.” And as such, they enrolled me and my siblings in a Hebrew day school for nine years, where we learned Hebrew, read the Torah, and prayed in a synagogue almost every morning. They always wanted us to learn about other faiths, and they always made sure that we knew the difference, though, between Islam and Judaism. But they also made sure we also respected our Jewish sisters and brothers in faith. My story is just one of 1.5 billion stories in some 57 countries. The Muslim population is one of the most diverse and eclectic in the world. We are Sunnis, we are Shias, and even in the Shia tradition there are Zaidis, Ismailis, Ismasheries [spelled phonetically]. There are numerous madhhabs, or schools of thought, and Sufi mystic orders. Like Christians and Jews, Muslims can be observant, nonobservant, performist, humanist, secularist, extremist, mainstream, and there are even some Muslims who consider themselves culturally Muslims but are actually atheists. Now, the motion before you tonight is asking you to determine whether Islam is a religion of peace. And at first blush, that might seem a bit tricky to decide. After all, the Koran and the Hadith have verses in them that point to peace and justice and love. But there are other verses that are violent, are about violence and about violence against specific people. So how then do we reconcile these seemingly contradictory verses? How then do we decide whether Islam is a religion of peace? The only way to answer that question is to take an honest look at the people who practice the faith and how they interpret it. According to Gallup's ground breaking study on what a billion Muslims think, 93 percent of Muslims around the world are peaceful, mainstream Muslims. Seven percent are what Gallup determines as politically radicalized. And within that seven percent, there's a smaller percent that has succumbed to the use of violence. Any percent is too much. But we must remember that the violent minority of a minority are motivated by politics, not religion. As Gallup concluded, what distinguishes the politically radicalized Muslims from the mainstream Muslims is their politics, not their piety. Robert Pape, a University of Chicago political scientist, further confirmed this in his book, Dying to Win, in which he came to the same conclusion, that the actions of terrorists are politically motivated, not through religion. The Tamil Tigers, for example, which are predominantly a Hindu group, used and pioneered the use of suicide bombing, did so far secessionist reasons, not for religious goals. Our opponents would have you believe that there is a take all, no winner clash between Islam and the West, and that Muslims who try to balance their Western values and Islam arrive at a state of cognitive dissonance and are left either mute or crazy by this internal struggle. That distribution description doesn't resonate for me or for my family or for my friends or for my community, because those two aspects of our identity were never in conflict with each other and were never introduced to us as in conflict with each other. I didn't realize that there were people out there who wondered whether people -- Muslims like me existed or could exist until after 9/11. Let me be clear. There are some horrifically violent criminals out there who twist our faith to justify their hate and their violence. But I am here to tell you they don't speak for Islam. Mohammad Hamdani [spelled phonetically], a first responder who died on 9/11, speaks for Islam. Hassan Askari, a Brooklyn Muslim who stepped in on the subway and saved a complete stranger who was being physically attacked because he was Jewish, he speaks for Islam. Zainab Salbi, through her organization Women for Women International, has assisted forever a quarter of a million women across the world. She speaks for Islam. And the entire Muslim community of India, who, when the authorities asked them to take the militants who attacked Mumbai in 2008, said resoundingly and collectively no. We will not let the terrorists be buried with us. The media and those who profit from the narrative of Islam versus the West are never going to tell you my story or the stories of these Muslims who constitute the vast majority of Muslims around the world. But just because you may not hear us, it doesn't mean we're not speaking out. And just because you may not see us on TV, it doesn't mean we don't exist. If you vote against the motion, I would argue you're voting against the moderate voices of mainstream Islam and telling the terrorists that you agree with their version. I urge to you vote for the motion. Thank you. "

    "data":"Ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised by the motion itself. When I first heard it, it reminded me of the academic question, how many angels can dance on the head of a pin? And I think, well, if you do the salsa or the cha cha, not many. Why are we not having a motion on is Christianity a religion of peace, is Judaism a religion of peace, et cetera? Because those would be academic motions. Unfortunately, the motion, “Islam is a religion of peace” is not academic. I respect and admire Zeba Khan. And I want to acknowledge the fact that you indeed are a demonstration of the assimilation of a Muslim individual, a Muslim woman into Western society, into an American society. But you come from a middle class family that was very eclectic and respected pluralism. I respect that very much, and I admire you for it. And I think you are an example to others. However, I disagree with you that you represent Islam or that you speak for Islam. The problem that is inherent in Islam from the time of its foundation up to this moment is who speaks for Islam. And I’ll get to that later on. Is it Zeba Khan or is it Faisal Shahzad? He was also a middle class man, went to business school, married an American woman, had two children, lived just like you, like many of you. And yet, he made a different choice based on a combination of piety and politics. And that's what Islam is. And before I go on, let me define the key terms of the motion. First, religion. The most common definition of religion you will find is the universal quest of humans in search -- in search of the sacred or the holy. That search is expressed intellectually. It's expressed in practice. It is expressed in fellowship. And you look at the religion like Islam, on an intellectual level it was expressed by the founder of Islam as a demolition of all other gods. Polytheism had to end, and all humanity had to be united under one God. From those of you who are familiar with history, and I think a crowd like this is, you know that no monotheistic religion can be a religion of peace. No monotheistic religion is a religion of peace, and definitely not Islam. Monotheistic religions know periods, lengthy periods of peace, but they also know lengthy periods of war. In times of practice, yes, in Islam, you practice charity, you go to Hajj, you pray, all of that. But in terms of practice, there is also the expression, there is the concept of jihad. And I find it a pity that Zeba Khan did not mention that concept, which is central to Islam's conquests and Islam's success. The founder of Islam, Mohammad, in his lifetime, conducted 65 campaigns of war that were all successful. And that militaristic history of Islam is well documented. Just go Google it. And if you don't find it on Google, go to all those former empires that were conquered. The combination of a history of empire, of conquest, also leaves a legacy behind. And that legacy is the thrusting together of people of different ethnicities, languages, et cetera. So even if that empire declines, the likelihood, the likelihood of conflict, of war, is probable. It's high, especially where there is a fault line. That's where Samuel Huntington had a point. That history of militarism, combined with the legacy of empire, those two points alone belie the motion tonight, that Islam is a religion of peace, but that's not all. When empires decline, those who are defeated, and the Muslim Empire declined, those who are defeated sometimes themselves in a state of victimhood. That state of victimhood is exploited by the leadership or the self-appointed leaders of Islam. And what do you see? You see a number of people, and I concede it's a minority, who believe that Islam is under siege. A mentality of victimhood tells those who are conquered, who are vanquished, that the problem was caused by external powers, not by us, and that systematic denial within Islam after the 19th Century to blame only outsiders exempts Islam from blame, from the explanation what went wrong. Yes, it was external, yes, Muslims were humiliated, yes, they were conquered, yes, they were colonized, but how much was also because of the flaws of Islam? And that takes me to the point of absolutism. When the West went into its scientific revolution, why wasn't it Muslims? Muslims were the first scientists, arithmetic, logic, et cetera. They were great; why didn't they get into that scientific revolution? Why were they left behind? Was it only because of external factors or were there internal flaws? That combination of a status of victimhood and the absolutism -- the demand that you can never revise or reflect on the Koran, that you can never, never ever refute what Mohammad said, you can only follow his example -- that absolutism combined with that status of victimhood also enlarges the likelihood of conflict, and those two combined like the other two factors like -- Thank you. That belies the motion. I'll keep my last two factors for the time I have remaining, thank you. "

    "data":"Can I indulge the audience and just ask for a round of applause for Zeba's mom, she's just over there, I think she did a wonderful job. To raise your daughter to speak Hebrew in the current climate is amazing and I applaud you. So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me this opportunity. I want to begin by just stating what this debate is not about. This debate is not about making excuses for terrorism. Basically my career is to challenge extremism and terrorism in the West and also in Muslim majority countries. I've just flown right in from Pakistan where I've been building the foundations for the first nationwide social movement to challenge extremism and promote democratic values in Pakistan. And I'm proud to announce that just today we gained our 10,000th member on Facebook. So this debate -- -- this debate is not about making excuses for suicide bombers even inside Israel. We make no apologies and no excuses on this panel for terrorism, for extremism, and for people who kill innocent civilians, including inside Israel. This debate acknowledges, we, on our panel, Zeba and myself, acknowledge that Muslims do need to speak out against extremism and to challenge it, and more Muslims need to do that more actively. We acknowledge that Muslims bear responsibility in reclaiming their faith from those -- the minority who have hijacked Islam and who have captured the public imagination in their definition of Islam. We acknowledge that, and I am in my own person a manifestation of that effort, as is Zeba in the way she was raised. So we acknowledge that as well. This debate, in fact, is an appeal. It’s not -- also, before I move to the fact that it’s an appeal, it’s also not a threat. So, we’re not going to argue here tonight that if you don’t vote for the motion, that somehow Muslims are going to rise up and attack you for insulting Islam. That’s not the case. This is an appeal. And it’s an appeal to your good sense and your good character and to what you know inside you. This is not a debate for Islam at all. This is a debate for peace. And we are not arguing for Islamic peace; we’re arguing for Islam to be -- with all other religions and beliefs and those that have no faith -- to be part of the effort to create peace in the world. So this is a debate for peace. It’s a debate, and I’m asking you all to vote tonight not for Islam, but to vote for peace and to help contribute the efforts of all of us around the world who are working for peace. Because there are people like me who spent 13 years of our lives working to create hatred. I used to believe that Islam is not a religion of peace. In fact, I used to believe that Islam mandates war. I used to believe and propagate across the world in more than three countries that Islam mandates war and mandates the creation of a state that will have at its heart of its foreign policy a policy to create conquest. I called it jihad. I believed that Islam was not a religion of peace because I adopted an ideology at 16 years old and stuck with that until my imprisonment and after I was released from prison when I was 28 years old. By that time I had established this ideology in Pakistan and in Denmark and contributed to its growth in Egypt. But I learned in prison two things. One was what I’m appealing to you today and that was when people hold out an olive branch, it does work. People I’d considered my enemy, people I’d considered the enemy of my people, Amnesty International with their advocation of human rights that I believed was a tool to colonize the minds of Muslims, adopted me as a prisoner of conscience. And by handing me that olive branch, I recognized that there was goodness in the world and there were people who, regardless of the provocation they find in the world today, are still willing to fight for peace and are still willing to redefine the debate. And that’s what I’m asking you to do here tonight. Because by redefining the debate, and by insisting that they would not allow my hatred to define for them the way in which they viewed me, they changed my heart. I went on and took that message forward and helped establish the world’s first counter-extremism think tank in the West, then went into Pakistan to establish the first nationwide counter-extremism movement in Pakistan. And as I said, we had 10,000 supporters before we’d even launched, of Muslims in Pakistan who are helping us to redefine the debate, who are not allowing the minority of extremists to hijack Islam, to monopolize its definition, and then define for us all that this should be a world of war, not just Islam as a religion of war, but as you heard from our co-panelists on the other side, all religions should be religions of war in their minds. Whether that’s because they want to fight or because they don’t believe in religions and they wish to challenge religions from that basis. And so I make an appeal to all of you tonight to help us redefine this debate. And the second thing that happened to me in prison that helped me change my mind was that I had the opportunity -- I won’t say good fortune because it wasn’t really that -- but the opportunity to mix with some of the leading founding jihadists of the world inside an Egyptian prison, ironically built by the British. And what I learned was that I had been extremely arrogant. I had suffered from the failure that I saw here tonight in my respected colleagues’ presentation. I had failed to contextualize history, and when I was this young and angry 24-year-old who, yes, had grievances, who’d been stabbed at multiple times growing up on the streets of Essex, who had been falsely arrested on a number of occasions because of racial profiling -- I was a very angry young man. But I went to men in prison, who had been in prison since I was three years old, and then I met them at 24, and they had abandoned their previous terrorist ideologies and I had the arrogance to try and convince them that they had sold out, that they didn’t understand that true Islam was a religion of war. And they said to me, “Young lad, come and sit down. We’ll tell you a story or two.” And over the course of the four years, after having learned Arabic, after having memorized half of the Koran, after having studied the theology, though myself not being too much of a religious man, I came to the conclusion that Islam had been hijacked and abused and politicized by something that I now refer to as Islamism, the modern ideology that owes more to post World War I European fascism than it does to the traditions of Islam. And these former jihadists, among them the assassins of Egypt's former president, Anwar Sadat, who was killed in 1981, they had come to the same conclusions. And so I appeal to all of you as my time runs out -- there is much more to say -- to vote to help us all to redefine this motion, to redefine this world, because only by refusing to accept the paradigms that we find imposed upon us can we refute change. And that's exactly how the civil rights movement in America tackled this issue when they were faced with such situations in the past. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for your time. "

I said, “Well, get somebody to do the next one.” She said, “I could find a Catholic who could say Mohammad made me a Catholic.” I said, “How about trying to make a three-part article and get a third one of somebody saying Mohammad made me a Jew.” And that one would be the trouble. Well, thank you. Thank you. It's a great pleasure to be here tonight. I'm sorry to make this panel rather Brit-centric after my colleague Maajid. It isn't an attempt by us to have a British takeover of the old colony or anything like that. But I was coming earlier from my own fallen empire, going back to my friend and colleague Ayaan's comments earlier. And I was reading the paper, as I'm sure all of you were doing all yesterday. Maajid finished his comments by talking about the importance of changing paradigms. I'm not sure it is about paradigms. I think it's about facts. Here are some facts. In my newspaper earlier, the Times Square Bomber, of course, a man just up the road from here, who tried to kill thousands of people, only, by the way, didn't manage it because he set the 24-hour timing device at 7:00 a.m. instead of 7:00 p.m., 1900 hours was what it was meant to be. If he had to have got that bit right, thousands of New Yorkers would have died earlier this year, again. I see further in the paper 12 suspects arrested in France in a network trying to recruit people to go in to fight American and other troops in Afghanistan. I turn to another page of the newspaper, in the city I had just flown off from this morning, a Muslim London Underground worker who was -- had written to his wife who was off to -- tried to become a martyr for Allah, as he said. He said, “More than anything I wish Allah to grant me martyrdom. Ladies and gentlemen, we have to look at facts. We should also, just quickly -- if I may refer something to the wording of tonight's debate, Ayaan's already mentioned it. But let me put it this way. You're, I'm sure, a liberal minded New York audience. At least I hope you are. We will see. But I imagine that if the motion we had here tonight was “Christianity is a religion of peace,” we get to the Q and A, perhaps even before, and somebody would say if the other side were arguing for that, somebody would say, What about the crusades, hmm? What about that? Then there'd be some other Clever Clarks who'd say, “I -- what about that Florida pastor the other week? There was a nasty business. That's Christianity for you.” If we'd have had tonight Judaism is a religion of peace, the other side would try to argue that. Sure as anything, there'd be people popping up in the hall tonight saying, “Oh, there's this bit in one of the Old Testament books, really, really bad, all sorts of massacres going on. Why don't you talk about that?” There might even be people trying to say that religion -- the argument that Judaism was a religion of peace couldn't be argued because people would say look at what Israel is doing. And isn't that a direct [unintelligible], and so on. So let's not have a debate about Islam and whether or not Islam is a religion of peace without talking about the facts to do with Islam. It's an absurd situation we're in, where nothing that anyone does whilst being Muslim is any responsibility of Islam. Yet anything anyone does whilst being a Christian or a Jew is the responsibility of all Christians, all Jews. Let's make this as straightforward as I can. Take the categorization that eminent scholars like Bernard Lewis and Ibn Warraq have made. Let's say Islam is a very, very complex thing. And the best way I can do this in the very short time I have, is say you have three Islams, Islam one, two, and three. Islam one, the Koran and the life of Mohammad and the Hadith. Islam two, the tradition of the Sharia. Islam three, what Muslims do now. The first of those things, Islam, the Koran and so on, is bad. It is bad. There is a lot of violence in it. And what's worse, the peaceful verses are superseded by the violent verses. The violent verses also sadly are more numerous in number. Then you've got the life of Mohammad. Again, a bad man, a very bad man. It happens to be that not a great role model if you look at it. Takes child brides, abuses a small girl, multiple wives, himself a warrior, himself a war criminal, himself beheads Jews. This, I would have thought, would be a signal of not great peacefulness. Then you've got the tradition of the Sharia, again, not great peacefulness, still no schools of Sharia that people in this hall would want to submit to. And thirdly, what Muslims do now. Thankfully, there is some hope in that one, because most Muslims, thank goodness -- I almost said thank God, but -- old habits die-hard. Most Muslims don't do what those texts say because they exercise their judgment as moral beings without having to refer to defunct holy books. Now, look, I wish that Zeba and Maajid were the spokespeople of Islam. It would be lovely. Although in Maajid's case, it would have taken rather too long if everyone had to go 14 years of preaching the downfall of America and then said no, not so much. But we are where we are. Anyhow, I wish they spoke for Islam. It would be great. But the fact is that tonight, the organizers of this debate asked a number of clerics, none of them which showed, specifically they wouldn't show and debate against Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Myself, I don't think they cared. But no, it's very interesting. They will not debate. Time and again, Muslims -- the actual leaders of your religion will not debate this. And you are left with people -- now here, the reasons why of course is the leaders of the religion show such terrible -- terrible lessons. It is not a small thing. It's not as if it were a detail. It's not like a wacky Florida pastor. But you've got the largest Sunni state of Saudi Arabia, the most important Sunni state in the world, the most extraordinary closed prison of a society. It's not a detail. It's not a one-off nut job. The Shiite republic of Iran is what it is, led by the people it's led by. That is not an accident. It's not a detail. The thing that worries me is that although tonight we hear from the panelists here about how Islam is a religion of peace, the fact is that the people who are making the decisions in the religion, the people who are preaching the religion, the heads of that religion, people like Sheikh Qaradawi who broadcasts anti-Semitic -- the most appalling filth every week on the main network, that is the faith that is speaking for you guys. I wish that Zeba, you were on every week on Al Jazeera, but you are not. Qaradawi is. The problem is that Islam is an unstable component, as a religion, an unstable component. A thousand years ago, the Mustabalites [spelled phonetically] tried to reform the religion. They were wiped out. The fact is that Islam is many things, many, many things. But to say it's a religion of peace is nonsense. It's to ignore reality. It's to ignore very difficult but necessary facts, not paradigms, but facts. To say that Islam is a religion of peace is to say something based entirely on hope. It's to elevate a hope into truth. And I hope, as you will note, history teaches us that's a very bad thing to do. Thank you. "

    "data":"Good. Okay, thank you very much for inviting us all this evening and thank you for being here. We in favor of this motion argue that Islam is dominated by radicals. What do we mean by radicals? We mean those who are striving for a political order representing a reactionary version of Islam that denies legal and civic equality to men and women and also denies it on the basis of religion. It also denies freedom of speech and freedom of thought. We believe such trends, such people, currently dominate world Islam. Let us be quite clear about what we are not arguing. We are not arguing that Islam itself is inherently radical. Like any other movement, Islam takes different forms at different times. Also, we are not arguing that most Muslims are radical. Most are not. But what we are saying is that it is the radicals who have their hands on the levers of power. They are, to pick a word, the hegemonic. They’re the most powerful driving force. They’re tending to set the direction and shaping the future of Islam in the modern world. They do this not because they have superior numbers, but because they are extremely focused in what they want. They’re clear about it. They are often well organized. They’re often very well funded, often by Saudi Arabia and they are very, very committed, being quite willing to often kill themselves and to kill other people, especially Muslims. So this is what we’re arguing. To illustrate this I just want to show some of the trends which we have seen in the world in the last twenty-five to thirty years. Some twenty-nine years ago, of the major Muslim countries in the world only one -- Saudi Arabia - maintained that its political and constitutional order was a reflection of what it regards as original Islam and that it has accepted no foreign or infidel accretions. Saudi Arabia was, and is, one of the world’s most repressive states. Many, many examples could be given but I just mention one recent incident when three Saudi intellectuals sent a petition to the king – a petition asking for a gradual move towards a constitutional government. They were charged with using – I quote – un-Islamic terminology. The un-Islamic terminology they used in their petition included the word human rights and democracy. So we have the situation of Saudi some thirty years ago. Then in February of 1979, the Ayatollah Komeini overthrows the Shah and establishes a draconian regime in Iran, which also since then has become one of the most repressive regimes in the world. It bars anybody who is not a Muslim from having any authority over a Muslim. It bars Muslims who do not support the regime’s version of Islam from running for political office. One other example: In Iran, if you kill someone who is a member of one of the non-listed religions, non-recognized religions – say, such as the Baha’is – there is no punishment. To kill a dog, a cat or a Baha’i is the same thing. It is no matter of the law because they have no legal status. They do not religiously and politically exist. Similarly, for sexual relations between a non-Muslim man and a Muslim woman, the penalty for the non-Muslim is death. And of course, the penalty for homosexuals of whatever religion is death. A new proposed penal code has been presented to the Iranian Parliament which would institutionalize its current practice that it would require with no possibility of reprieve, annulment that the penalty for heresy or for apostasy -- leaving Islam-- is death. Article 112 of this, this penal code also emphasizes the law will be extraterritorial. This means, incidentally, if this law is in fact passed, under Iranian law Barack Obama should be executed as an apostate. With the development of Iran next door to them, the Saudis redoubled their own efforts to export their own version of radical Islam. They proclaim themselves, on many occasions, theMuslim Vatican -- a very un-Muslim term -- and now, by most best estimates, spend some three billion dollars exporting their radical version of Islam around the world. That’s somewhat more, that’s about three times as much as the Soviet Union used for ideological purposes at the height of its power. If one travels to a moderate Muslim country, such as Indonesia, or if you travel throughout Africa, you will find Saudi-funded mosques, Imams, lectures, sermons, students, books, videos, fatwas propagating its own reactionary version of Islam. The Iranians seek to do the same. One result of this, though there are homegrown radical movements, with this organizational push behind them, one sees the growth of radical Islam throughout the world. Some examples: when Pakistan was founded it was not founded – …as an Islamic country. The Ali Jinnah – the man who founded the country -- said, whether you’re a Muslim or you’re a non- Muslim is no matter of the state. But now they have introduced blasphemy laws, which include the death penalty, particularly used on religious minorities. In Sudan, the government has instituted laws and propagated genocidal wars against the south in Darfur, killing some two million and two hundred and fifty thousand, respectively. In Nigeria, some fifty thousand people have died in conflict over the introduction of radical Islam. We see this phenomena repeated throughout the world and one could give very many more examples. One sees it even in, growing in Malaysia and Indonesia – historically very moderate countries. One result is that in Freedom House’s rankings of the world’s twenty un-free countries, the majority now are Muslim. Okay, the crucial confluence of ideas is not between the West and the Muslim world – …it is within the Muslim world. Thank you."

    "data":"There is something peculiar about the way that this debate tonight is being worded. The idea that we could, from our comfortable perches here in Manhattan, pass judgment on the beliefs and practices of a billion and a half people in every corner of the world. And despite Mr. Marshall’s comments, we’re not here to talk about whether Saudi Arabia or Iran is dominated by radicals. We’re here to talk about whether Islam is dominated by radicals. So I suppose it’s not surprising that a large percentage of people in this room would believe that Islam – unquestionably the most eclectic, the most diverse religion in the history of the world – is dominated by radicals. After all, no field work or research is necessary to come to such a conclusion – just turn on your television, watch your nightly news. Now, of course, we’re not children in this room. We all recognize that the purpose of commercial news is to sell commercials – which, by the way, is why I only get my news from NPR, Robert. And what sells commercials, of course, is violence and terror. You all know this. So then if there are violent protests about, let’s say, against deliberately provocative cartoons of the prophet Mohammed in a Danish newspaper, that’s a story. However, if a racist politician in The Netherlands makes a movie – we’re talking about Geert Wilders here -- makes a movie comparing the Koran to Mein Kampf and requesting its abolishment in the entire country and no protests erupt, the lack of protest is not a story. There is simply no story. Similarly, if the Pope makes some controversial comments about the prophet Mohammed and there are mass protests on the street, that’s a story. If the Pope goes to Turkey and no mass protests erupt, it’s not that the lack of protests is a story. There is no story. And I can tell you because I was there with CNN. Of course, much of this debate tonight – and in…and indeed, much of the debate about Islam in general is based not only on the media but on firsthand anecdotal evidence provided by, quote/unquote, insiders. And I’m sure you’ll hear plenty of that tonight from Asra and Daveed. How the experiences of the colleagues for the motion in confronting radicals in their own communities has given them the knowledge necessary to judge the beliefs and practices of a billion and a half people, I’m not sure. I will say that if I based my views of Catholicism on the stories that I hear from my former Catholic friends and on the media reports about Catholicism, I’d pretty much have to assume that Catholicism is dominated by sadistic pederasts. But of course that’s not true. So then I suppose the real question here is why do we keep asking pundits and politicians and writers and public intellectuals what Muslims think? Why don’t we just simply ask Muslims themselves? This is, after all, not so arduous a task. In fact, the Gallop organization – the most trusted polling organization in the world -- has already done the work for us by conducting the largest, most comprehensive poll of the Muslim world ever done. According to that poll, a mere seven percent of the world’s Muslims – not Arabs – seven percent of the world’s Muslims believe that the attacks of 9/11 were justified. Now, more interestingly, Gallop went a little bit further and actually asked those seven percent why they believe the attacks were justified. And the responses fly in the face of conventional wisdom. For example, in Indonesia – the largest Muslim country in the world, and frankly, quite a pluralistic and successful democracy -- not a single respondent, not a single respondent in Indonesia cited the Koran as justification for the attacks of 9/11. Indeed, seventy four percent of Indonesians, eighty-six percent of Pakistanis, eighty-one percent of Bangladeshis and eighty percent of Iranians said that attacks against civilians were, quote, never justified -- never. Now, please compare that to forty-six percent of Americans who said the same. In fact, the Gallop poll found that in all Muslim countries the majority of those Muslims who, quote/unquote, support violence or what we can refer to as radical views or tendencies do so for markedly secular – that is, political – reasons. Robert Pape found similar tendencies in his comprehensive study of suicide bombing. He found that ninety-five percent of all suicide terrorism is, quote, not driven by religion as much as by clear strategic – read, political – objectives. In short, when we talk about radicalism in the Muslim world we are talking about political radicalism, which after all, in a globalized world is not that odd. Why are these political goals so often couched in the language of religion – and in this case – …the language of Islam? Well, it’s because in every society religion holds the most currency with the masses. In every society religion provides a powerful language to create simple collective identities and to urge collective action. In every society the language of religion has the power to distill the most complex sociopolitical issues into the simplest of choices – good versus evil, us versus them. As I say, this is true of every society, ours especially. And if you don’t believe me, I suggest you ask Karl Rove. Thank you."

    "data":"So I would say assalamu alaykum to all of you, but according to the prayer book that I was handed when I went on the pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, I’m not allowed to say this peaceful greeting to those who aren’t Muslim. When I see that headline: Islam is dominated by radicals, I don’t hesitate in believing it to be true. The opposite side wants to suggest that we can’t tell you stories from the trenches. But it is, in fact, in the trenches where we know what is happening, that we know that the radicals are, in fact, intimidating, silencing and paralyzing the moderates. I know it from my lifetime in the Muslim community and I know it from stories and anecdotes, sure, and historical and country cases. When I was given this proposition I asked my mother – a grandmother, who has taught me my Muslim prayers, who is teaching her grandchildren the prayers – I said, Do you think that Islam is dominated by radicals? You can dismiss her as an anecdote. You can dismiss her as somebody who isn’t pundit enough but she’s got her finger on the pulse of what’s going on in our communities. And she didn’t hesitate in saying yes. For the last thirty years that I have known, since the exportation of Wahabiism from Saudi Arabia to the far reaches of our Muslim world, I know that our community is dominated by radical ideology. I know that it is an ideology that has taken root in countries from Pakistan to states in Nigeria to provinces in Indonesia with laws that put women in second class status, that give women criminal punishments because of sexual crimes. In each instance you could say that there’s a political purpose. But at the end of the day it is done in the name of Islam. I don’t stand up here and condemn my faith. I fight for it every single day. I fight for a progressive interpretation of our faith. But at the end of the day our religion, our institutional Islam out there in the world -- from my home town of Morgantown, West Virginia to Islamabad, Pakistan to Indonesia to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia – we are controlled and dominated by radical ideology. The moderates don’t want to lose their status. They don’t want to lose their place in the community. They don’t want to lose their invitation to the potluck dinner parties and wedding halls that they get to go to. It’s an issue of social dynamics. At the end of the day it isn’t worth it to them to take on the radical ideology because there’s too much at stake. You risk your own safety and then you risk your social standing. I know this as a woman in the faith. I know that what we are struggling with is a situation where more mosques in America than in the 1990s are putting women in separate sections. Two-thirds of mosques in America versus half in the 1990s have women separated. And you could argue that that’s not radical ideology. But at the end of the day it is part of a continuum of an interpretation of Islam that takes a literal read that says a woman is sexual temptation, that a woman is sexual distraction. You take that interpretation and it isn’t that long that you have to also add up to an interpretation that says that you can’t be friends with the Jews and the Christians, that violence is acceptable. Why do I know this? Because I’ve heard it from my pulpit. I’ve heard it from the sermons that are downloaded on college campuses across this country and across the world. There is an exportation of this ideology. We may watch our borders, we may check the visas of people who come into this country but I know that there is an ideology that says that a woman is half the witness of a man in criminal cases, that that is law in countries of our, of our religion, that there is interpretation that says that a woman gets less inheritance. When we put women -- half of our population, in particular -- in second class status around the world, you can call it anything you want. But I consider it unacceptable and I call it radical ideology. It’s unacceptable to have tradition become religion with female genital mutilation. It’s unacceptable to have honor killings, as we are, from Canada to Texas to Turkey. You can call those anecdotes but it’s a trend. It’s a trend that’s happening because our Islam of today is dominated by radicals. We don’t have mosque leaders who are keeping that kind of ideology in check. We are, in fact, having leaders who accept preaching from the pulpit that says that we cannot imitate the dis-believers, that we cannot say assalamu alaykum to those who are not Muslim. At the end of the day what I want you to know is that I stand up for Islam as a faith. I stand up for the principles just like every other religion. But like Judaism and Christianity have evolved so that there is a continuum in institutional religion, so that there is a reform synagogue along with the orthodox synagogue, our mosques are defined by an institutional puritanical interpretation that to me is very radical and very unacceptable. And I encourage you to vote to support this motion because we need a truth telling. We need to be honest. We need to not cower in the face of political correctness. A lot of you may have hesitation because you think that if you vote for the motion you are voting and condemning Islam. I don’t stand here before you saying that that is at all on the table. We can stand up for religion that is not dominated by radicals, but we can accept the fact when it is. And in our day, in the trenches in the Muslim world from a mosque just a few blocks away from here to Seattle, Washington to Dubai, we are facing a momentum where the leadership is one that accepts radical ideology and the moderates don’t stand up against it. So I encourage you to vote for the motion and understand that it’s a vote for truth. Thank you."

    "data":"I will bid you assalamu alaykum, because that is what my faith teaches me and that, regardless of who is in the pulpit, is what the book teaches. When we consider the question of whether Islam is dominated by radicals we have to look in terms of absolute numbers and in terms of prominence and in terms of symbols. Saying that Islam is dominated by radicals is much like saying, is as absurd as saying that America is dominated by murderers. Certainly they exist within our society and certainly radicals exist within the fold of Islam. But do they dominate? Absolutely not. Based on the polling data that Reza shared with you and based on so much other data that exists out there, the people on the Muslim streets, both in the West and in the, quote/unquote, Muslim world, are striving for freedom, for freedom of speech, for democracy, for technology, for those very things that they admire the West for. That is what their faith is pushing them to do. Now, Islam is dominated, if you will, by scholars, by average people more so than anyone else, who are struggling to understand Islam in a 21st Century context and who seek to foster inclusion of Muslims on the international stage and who want nothing more than to be understood and to be respected, as that same poll showed over and over again. To point to Saudi Arabia over and over again, I will hand that to the other side. Saudi Arabia is no, by no means the shining glory of any part of the Muslim world. But pointing to pockets in no way reflects the overall picture, the overall reality. Looking in a pocket or in many pockets in no way represents the overall cost to, the overall character of the people and it is the people who define the faith and who define their global community. The reality is that the moral – You know, when we look at where this radical threat lies -- I travel across this country and around the world. We can fight anecdotes with anecdotes. When I was in Malaysia a few years ago talking to youth on the streets there, their single goal was to be understood. They wondered why Americans didn’t understand them and why Americans thought that they were all terrorists. When I traveled to Egypt it was the same. When I traveled even to Bosnia, to the former Yugoslavia where my parents are from, it was very much the same. The lack of understanding on both sides of the issue has in many ways been fueled by media perceptions as we have described here earlier. The reality on the ground is this: radicals are failing in their attempt to dominate. Radicals, those who make up Al Qaeda and its various branches, are on the run. They are in decline. Their messages are not reaching the audiences that they seek to convert and to brainwash as much as they used to. And that, to me, is an important symbol of the rise of moderation, the rise of the middle, the rise of those who dominate this faith. Even those in Al Qaeda – Ayman al-Zawahiri, who recently released a tape – they have had to change their tactics because they are receiving criticism from within the Muslim community. They have had to respond to criticism about targeting civilians and have had to answer these questions to the very people that they are trying to recruit. And if we look even at the reality in the, quote/unquote -- and I say again, quote/unquote -- Muslim world, look even to Pakistan, where we saw that the radicals indeed killed Bhutto. But what did the people do in response? They elected a secular government. They responded in a different way. The people on the ground are the ones who are defining the face and the nature and the character of the faith and of the global Muslim community. And again, what do they want? That’s what we have to remember. They do not want death and destruction. They want hope, they want economic ability, they want education and they want a seat at the table. If we also look to the, where the war against radicals is taking place, it’s almost entirely in the Islamic world, between mainstream societies and governments on the one hand and radical minorities on the other hand. Just look at what Muslim scholars and Muslim leaders have been able to achieve in the last few years and then we’ll ask ourselves, Why haven’t we heard about it? In 2005 Jordan’s King Abdullah convened an international Islamic conference of two hundred of the world’s most leading Islamic scholars from fifty different countries. Those scholars unanimously issued a ruling on three fundamental issues – the validity of all interpretations of Islam, the eight legal schools. They forbade the declaration of apostasy between Muslims and they further provided pre-conditions to issuing fatwas, since they have become such a currency on the international market and have lost their meaning entirely. That’s one example. Another is that a hundred and thirty-eight Muslim scholars joined together to affirm freedom of expression -- scholars from around the world – and to condemn the negative reactions to the Danish cartoons and which resulted, I think, interestingly, of the fact that there was very little, if – very little reaction to the most recent Danish, episode, if you will, of the film Fitna. And those same scholars reached out to the Pope to establish a historic Muslim/Catholic forum… …seeking opportunities for dialogue that they could do on an international scale at the level of leadership and that could also be modeled for their citizens and their countries and for the faithful among them who wanted to see something different take place. Internationally recognized leaders are calling for integration, for tolerance and for advancement. And their reach is ten times wider at least than that of Al Qaeda or any of their associates. Just consider those, even in Turkey, which has recently elected a new government but has taken the lead in ushering in a historic re-examining of Islamic material to cater to the contemporary world. That is just one among countless examples of people who are working day in, day out to re-emerge as the dominant force within their faith and who are crying out for attention on the world stage. Just consider this last example, which is that, what –"

    "data":"Thank you. I actually wore this t-shirt for the subject of the debate. And it's the center of the debate. And it's clear. The motion is science refutes God. And Michael and I have the distinct advantage here of arguing in favor of the motion because in fact we have evidence, reason, logic, rationality, and empirical methods on our side, whereas the opponents have vague hopes and fears, and they're arguing in favor of a motion that's hanging on for its existence by mere shreds of emotional and ideological spaghetti, much like this type provided by the flying spaghetti monster, one of the equally irrational gods which science provides no support for. But I first want to begin by clarifying the nature of the motion, because the motion isn't science disproves God. It's science Refutes God. And that's very important because you can't disprove a notion that's basically vague and unfalsifiable. I could not -- there's no way to disprove the notion that God didn't create all of us 15 seconds ago with the memories of the amusing comments we heard before that. There's no way we can disprove that, okay. And that's really important to recognize that those kind of unfalsifiable notions are unfalsifiable, as I say. But we can ask, is it rational to expect that that's likely. And tonight I want to emphasize that 500 years of science have demonstrated that God, that vague notion, is not likely. It's irrational to believe in God. Now, to refute God means refuting several claims. Onethat are all based on faith, not evidence. One, that God is necessary, two, that there is evidence for God; and three, that that belief is rational. And the point is that the progress of science has shown over and over and over again that the answers to all those three questions are no. No, no, no. Now, my own scientific field is cosmology. And that's the study of the origin and evolution of the universe as a whole. And it's where science and religion sort of confront each other. And creation myths have abounded throughout human history, and science confronts those creation myths. And we'll talk about that, I'm sure, at some point in the debate. But I want to point out that our opponents, I'm pretty sure, are going to argue first that one aspect of science that supports perhaps the belief in God is this notion that the universe is apparently fine-tuned for life. I hear that a lot, and because it was fine-tuned so life could exist. That is a remarkable and, in fact, cosmic misunderstanding, because it's the same kind of misunderstanding that led people to believe in special creation for life on earth before Darwin. It looked like everything was designed for the environment in which it lived. But what Darwin showed us was that a simple proposition, namely that there's genetic variation among a population combined with natural selection meant that you didn't need supernatural shenanigans, that in fact all the diversity of life on earth could arise from a single life form, by natural law. And he didn't know -- what he showed was it was plausible, based on the evidence -- he didn't know about DNA. He didn't know about the details of genetic replication, but he showed it was plausible. And as I'll say, that's where we're at now as far as the understanding of the universe is concerned. Now, our -- my opponents, I suspect, will argue the universe is equally fine-tuned for life, and they -- in fact, they will point out that certain fundamental parameters in nature, if they were different, we couldn't exist. Or they may boldly assert that, in fact, certain of these parameters are so strange and unnatural that they must have been established with malice aforethought to ensure our existence. This too is an illusion. Just as bees need to see the color of flowers but they're not designed to do it, if they couldn't see them, they couldn't get the nectar and reproduce. So what we're seeing is a version of cosmic natural selection. We would be quite surprised to find ourselves living in a universe in which we couldn't live. In fact, that might be evidence for God. But I want to point out that in fact the universe isn't particularly fine-tuned or conducive to life. Most of the universe is rather inhospitable to life. And in fact -- perhaps the biggest fine-tuning problem in my own field of cosmology, something I'm, in fact, very proud to have proposed in a sense is that the energy of empty space is not zero. The weirdest thing you can imagine, that empty space weighs something, but remarkably the energy of empty space is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than we would naïvely predict.And if it were much bigger than we measure, it's true that galaxies couldn't form, and planets couldn't form, and Intelligence Squared Debates couldn't happen. So the universe appears to be here because Intelligence Squared is here. Now, that suggests religion perhaps, but the point is not that that claim of fine tuning is ridiculous because, in fact, if the energy of empty space was zero, which is a -- by far a more natural value, the universe would be a better place for life to live in. We all thought it was zero when I was a graduate student, because that was a natural value. If it was zero, the universe would be a better place. In fact, you can show the value that it has now makes the universe the worst of all possible universes to live in for the future of life. So, so much for a universe created for us. Now, once Darwin had removed the apparent need for God in evolution of life, the last bastion for God was the creation of the universe, how you can get something from nothing. And what -- we're in a remarkable situation of being in is precisely the same situation that Darwin existed in 150 years ago, namely, we have a plausible explanation of how a universe could precisely come from nothing. If you asked, What would be the characteristics of the universe that came from nothing by natural laws? it would be precisely the characteristics of the universe we observe, and it didn't have to be that way. It could have been another way. And by nothing -- and it -- the -- my opponents will say that by nothing, I'm not talking about nothing, but I'm talking about nothing, no particles, no radiation, no space, no time, and even no laws of physics. Our -- [unintelligible] my opponents might argue that the multiverse, which our universe might have spontaneously been created in, was created by physicists because they don't like God, because it's eternal and exists outside our universe, those same characteristics that God is supposed to have. But it wasn't created because we don't like God, although I don't like God. It was -- we'd been driven to it by measurements. In fact, I don't even like the multiverse, but I've learned to force my beliefs to conform to the evidence of reality. That's where science differs from religion. There do remain deep philosophical and seismic questions that are unanswered, but God is not required or useful to explain any of them. And, therefore, to conclude, science has taught us that we don't need God to create a universe, that there's no evidence for God, that the specific sides of the claims of those who require God disagree with empirical evidence, and it's irrational. Science refutes God, so clearly you should vote for our side. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you for the opportunity to be with you tonight and to explain why science does not refute God. Let's agree that this motion is not about whether, for example, the latest sociological theories disprove the gods and goddesses of ancient Greek mythology. No, it's about whether modern natural science exemplified by things like physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and so on rule out thoughtful theism. The god I'm going to discuss is the God of Christianity, because I'm a follower of Jesus, but my side's job is not to convince you of the truth of Christianity, although I think it is true. Our job is just to show that Christianity's God is not refuted by science. Now, obviously there are some religious beliefs that are ruled out by science, for example, the belief that the earth is stationary and orbited by the sun, moon, and stars. That is disproved by science, and perhaps prior to the 17th century, most Christians held a belief like that, as did most other people. But that stationary earth belief is not in the least central to the Christian message and doctrine. To establish the motion, what our opponents have to do is to show that some central tenet of what Christians believe about God is impossible or at least highly implausible in the light of science, and that's a tall order. Actually, they can't even come close. But let me dispense with a couple of the most plausible sounding arguments. I'll illustrate one common argument from the writing of an MIT colleague, Alan Lightman, who wrote in the Salon magazine last year, he said, The central doctrine of science is the view that the laws of nature are inviolable. He said, Science and God are compatible as long as the latter, God, is content to stand on the sidelines once the universe has begun. Now, I certainly shall not shrink the God that I advocate down into a deistic, non-interventionist first cause. No, the God I'm interested in is personal and active in the world. So the question is, How do I answer Alan Lightman? It's straight forward. The presumption that the laws of nature are inviolable is just not a doctrine of science. Alan and a lot of other people are just wrong about that. Science's method and its program is to describe the universe insofar as it is repeatable and follows universal laws, but science hasn't got the slightest need to extrapolate that method and program into a presumption that everything that happens must be so describable. And the majority of the scientific heroes of history did not make that presumption. Great scientists like those that were recited before, Newton, Boyle, Dalton, Faraday, Maxwell, were Christian believers who saw their science as compatible with a God who is active in the world and, on occasion, works miracles that go beyond the laws that they were discovering. So the notion that for science to function, or in order to be a successful scientist, it is necessary to believe in universal laws, is indisputably disproved by history. A second frequent critique of belief in God is that it is based on irrational faith rather than evidence. And this, of course, is a fallacy. Belief in God is often highly rational. The universities that were established between, say, the 14th and the 18th centuries, were places of explicitly religious rationality and learning. Actually, evidence is just one type of reason for belief in God, and there is a loss of evidence for Christianity. But what the critics mean, I think, is -- they're saying there's no scientific evidence for God. And that goes to the heart of this question and the myth that science has somehow refuted God. Actually, there are some things we've learned about the universe through science that are highly suggestive of a creator, but for the sake of argument, suppose that the scientific evidence for God were non-existent. Would that mean that science refutes God, or would it even mean and support the more modest claim that there's no evidence for God? Not at all. God is mostly not a scientific question, and so the evidence for God is mostly not scientific. If you insist that scientific evidence is the only type you will count, then you put out of business not just religion, but a vast range of other human knowledge, like history, or the law, or politics, or philosophy, or literature. There's no scientific way to prove that Caesar crossed the Rubicon; there's no scientific way to judge the justice of a verdict; there isn't even a scientific way to detect a true thought. But all of these things are real cognitive questions whose answers are important and often indisputable. And questions about God are usually of the same type, not scientific. About 50 years ago, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space. Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev told the Communist Party, anti-religionist, Gagarin flew into space but he didn't find any God there. Well, what a silly argument. But most of the arguments behind the view that science has refuted God are of much the same type. If science, in its endeavors, fails to detect God, so what? Thoughtful Christians don't believe that God is a natural phenomenon or a law of nature to be established by scientific investigation. Science, for all of its power, is utterly incompetent to refute God. "

    "data":"Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to start off with a thought experiment. Imagine you're a hominid on the plains of Africa 3.5 million years ago. You're a tiny little Australopithecus afarensis, little brain. Your name is Lucy. Thank you. A lot of people in the Midwest don't get that. Evolution, what? Not that Lucy, the other one. And you hear a rustle in the grass. Is it a dangerous predator, or is it just the wind? If you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator, and it turns out it's just the wind, you've made a type one error in cognition. A false positive. You thought the wind was connected to something, and it wasn't. A was connected to B, and it wasn't. So that's a false positive. But that's relatively harmless. But if you think that the rustle in the grass is just the wind, and it turns out it's a dangerous predator, you're lunch. Congratulations. You've just been given a Darwin award for taking yourself out of the gene pool early before reproducing. And we are the descendants of those who are most likely to make type one errors, false-positives, versus type two errors, false-negatives. That is to say, why can't you just stay in the grass and collect enough data to get the answer right? And the answer is that predators don't wait around for prey animals to collect more data. That's why they stalk and sneak up on their prey animals, so they can't get enough data. So we evolve the propensity to make snap decisions and make one kind of error more likely than another kind of error. And that kind of error, that false positive, that's superstition. That's magical thinking. That's assuming A is connected to B. It's a true pattern, and it isn't, and you're wrong. That's the basis of finding false patterns like gods. Now, what's the difference between the wind and a dangerous predator? The wind is an inanimate force. A dangerous predator is an intentional agent. And his intention is to eat me, and that can't be good. So what we also do in addition to finding these meaningful patterns is infuse in them agency. That is, it's alive. It's real, it has intention, and its intention is not good, so I better assume it's real. And this is the basis of animism and spiritism and polytheism and monotheism and the belief in angels and aliens and demons and spirits and poltergeists and gods. Gods are invisible agents who run the world, who control things, who create these patterns, who are these patterns that we use to explain things. All cultures everywhere in the world have created god beliefs. Gods with these intentional -- that are intentional agents. So my question tonight is not like in my book, why do so many people believe in God, here is a theory, which I just outlined for you. But for tonight, I want to ask, what's more likely, that our opponents here happen to pick the right God and the right religion among all the -- about 10,000 different religions and about a thousand different gods the humans have constructed socially, anthropologically, psychologically in the last 10,000 years. 10,000 different religions, a thousand different gods. Our opponents agree with us that 999 of those gods are false gods. They are atheists like we are atheists. What I'm asking you to do is just go one God further with us. So here's what happened. About 5,000 to 7,000 years ago, these small bands of hunter-gathers began to coalesce into chiefdoms and states. As long as the numbers are small, informal means of behavior control and moral enforcement operate quite well. As soon as the numbers are too large for these informal means, shunning, making people feel guilty, gossiping about them, making them feel embarrassed for their bad behavior, as soon as the population are big, there's too much opportunity for free riding and for cheating the system and taking advantage of it and getting away with it. So two institutions evolved, government to set up a set of rules, and everybody gets a copy; and religion in case you think you got away with it, you didn't because there's an eye in the sky that those all and sees all and keeps track of this. So this is the second part of how humans construct religions and gods, because we need it for moral enforcement. It just so happens, by contingency and chance, religion and government was the first on the scene. Now, what's happened in the last several centuries, since the enlightenment, in addition to the trajectory that professor Krauss outlined for you, science displacing religion as the primary means of explaining how the world works, something else has also happened. We've slowly but ineluctably replaced religion as the primary source of our morals and came up with the clever idea that you actually have to have a reason why you have certain moral principles, and we're going to write certain laws. You actually have to give evidence for why you think this is a good law or a bad law or a good moral principle or a bad moral principle.  And that has been the trajectory of the enlightenment since about 200 years ago. And so again, what's more likely, that one of them happens to be the one true religion, and the one true God, and all those others that have been constructed are false gods or that, as we can clearly see, anthropologically, socially, psychologically and so on, this is what people do to get along. They construct religions. They construct moral systems and so on. We now know that we can do this without gods. In fact, we do it quite well without gods. Northern European countries do just fine with much lower rates of religiosity than we have. It is possible to do it, and that is what we've been doing.  Now, I want to finish with just one comment on the resurrection since Ian brought that up. Let me just -- leaving aside the scientific evidence for this, just think about what it is that is being said here. They are monotheists. They believe that there's just one God and that Jesus is God manifest on earth. And he is your savior, and you accept him for redeeming us for sins we never committed. Somebody else in the past committed them. So as I understand this, God sacrifices himself to himself to save us from himself. If that sounds as incomprehensible to you as it does to me, I urge to you vote for our side. Thank you "

    "data":"Thank you very much. How would one go about refuting the idea -- establishing the idea that science refutes God? First of all, you'd have to show that belief in God was, if not impossible, unreasonable. And, therefore, you'd have to show that all the people in the world who believe in God are also being unreasonable and that science has established this not at some point in the future, but has established it already. Science has refuted God right now. Now, on the face of it, this is such an odd and difficult and preposterous enterprise. Why? Because actually the questions to which God is the answer are really fundamentally not scientific questions. Here is what I mean. Here we are as human beings. We're thrown into the world. And we can't help if we're curious, if we're thoughtful to say, first of all, why is there a universe? Second, what's our purpose? What are we doing here? Third, what's going to come after? We're going to die, but what next? Now I ask you, what are the scientific answers to those questions? And in fact, the answers are, from science, don't have a clue, don't have a clue, and don't have a clue. Why? Because none of those questions is amenable to being decided empirically. Science can show how we got a universe but not why. On the question of what our purpose is here, science is completely silent. Moral issues are in a way outside the province of science. Why? Because science deals with what is, and morality is what ought to be. And finally, under the question of what comes after death, what possible empirical evidence can science provide on either side of that question? So because science is in no position to refute God, what we get from the other side is pop psychology. And we've been getting pop psychology from atheists for several hundred years. It's an effort to explain why people believe instead of providing any kind of a real refutation. You remember a few decades ago Freud basically said that God and religion could be dismissed as wishful thinking, We wish for a better world and so we make one up. Well, that would kind of explain Heaven which satisfies wishful thinking, but it really wouldn't explain why major religions have invented Hell. Who would wish for that? Hell is a lot worse than diabetes or the suffering we have in this life. And then you've heard here people like Richard Dawkins say, Well, belief in God depends on where you're born. If you're born in Afghanistan you're going to be a Muslim. If you're born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, you're likely to be a Christian. Michael Shermer alluded to that a little bit when he talked about multiple gods. But the sociology of the origin of belief says nothing about the truth of a belief. I'm sure that people who are born in Oxford, England, are most likely to believe in Darwin's theory of evolution than people who are born in Oxford, Mississippi. I'm sure people who are born in New York are more likely to believe in relativity than people who are born in New Guinea. What does that say about whether evolution or relativity is true? Nothing. The genesis of a belief, how you came to it, has nothing to do with whether or not that belief can be sustained as a matter of argument. The reality is, and we keep hearing a lot about Darwin because the last good argument against God came out in 1850 -- in the 1850s, science has made a whole bunch of discoveries since then but they point in the opposite direction. And, therefore, what you find very often from atheists is now highly complicated defensive maneuvers to account for things that atheists resisted all the way. When the discovery of the big bang came -- this, by the way, was at a time when most scientists believed the universe was eternal, the steady state universe was the prevailing doctrine of American and Western science -- so it came as a shock that the universe had a beginning. Why? Because, in a way, it wasn't just that matter had a beginning, but space and time also had a beginning. In other words, this was something that the ancient Hebrews had said thousands of years ago and without conducting a single scientific experiment. By the way, this is not the same as other cosmologies. Other ancient cosmologies posited the universe being fashioned by a kind of carpenter god who made it out of some preexisting stuff, but the ancient Hebrews said, No, first there was nothing, and then there was a universe. By the way, that's almost identical to what Lawrence Krauss said, First, there was nothing, no particles, no energy, no laws, and then there was the universe, completely consistent to what -- with what Christians believe, and exactly said by the ancient Hebrews thousands of years ago without doing a single experiment but solely on the  basis of, God told us. And the astounding fact is that 2,000 years later, modern science, after climbing round and round the mountain, has arrived at the top only to find a bunch of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries. Now, the fine-tuned universe is -- has become now a tremendous embarrassment to atheism. Why? Because ultimately it shows that the laws and constants of nature are fine-tuned, not only for the existence of life, but specifically for human life.  I want to note that this is an argument completely immune to Darwinian attack. This is not about whether the horse, the dog, and the wolf had a common ancestor. Let's remember that evolution, powerful theory as it is, is not a theory of life. It is only a theory of transitions between life forms. It's not about the origin of life, it's simply about how life form A gave rise to life form B. And the fact is that there have to be certain conditions, self-replicating cells, an old universe, an old earth that are necessary for evolution to take place. In other words, the fine-tuned universe is a precondition of Darwinian evolution itself. We are living at a time when religious believers do not need to be afraid of science; they should, as I do, embrace science and welcome science because correctly understood, far from pointing away from God, science thrillingly points to God. Thank you. "

    "data":"John, thank you very much indeed. I must begin by asking you, if I may, to focus on what the proposition is before us. We're not here to discuss the existence of God. We are not here to discuss whether it's rational, irrational to have faith. We're here to discuss a sociological phenomenon, a man-made phenomenon, religion. You can see the difference. You might call in question whether or not gods and goddesses. But you can't call in question whether or not there is religion. There's plenty of it. History is full of it, and it exists around us all the time today. By the way, I say that religion is man-made advisedly. There are very few women indeed in the upper half of hierarchies of the world's religions, which perhaps has something to do with the point. Now, religions are very diverse in nature. They have different interpretations of their deities. They say different things about what we can wear and what we can eat and when, how many wives we can have, what rituals we must follow. Despite the fact that they all take the view that they've got the right story, they differ from one another quite dramatically in a number of respects. And this is why, through the course of history, they've burdened mankind with a huge number of conflicts and a great deal of divisiveness. But I'm not going to bore you by rehearsing the story of crusades and inquisitions and the rest. It's a very familiar matter. Although it is, of course, in the interests of apologists of religions to try to forget them. Rather, I wanted to talk about things that religions have in common with one another rather than the things that divide them. They have two things in common with one another. Most of the time in history, and among many of the orthodox manifestations of religion today, they are similar to one another in -- most of them, giving second-class status to women and being hostile to gays, in being very opposed to most kinds of progress, especially scientific progress. The reason being, of course, that they take it that they received the truth a long time ago, anything between one and 3,000 years ago. And so things that are challenging and are new and offer us different views of the world, they find unpalatable. And so they tend to be very traditionalist, very conservative and rather retrogressive. And that explains a great deal of the social policy and political endeavor that the religions engage in. That's one thing that they tend to have in common with one another. But another thing they have in common with one another, a very important point, is that they share a structural feature. In fact, they are -- the religions are paradigmatic of a certain kind of organization, what I call a monolithic ideology, a one-size-fits all, top-down, totalizing ideology which says we've got the right story, and you've got to sign up for it. If you don't sign up for our story, if you don't agree, you are going to pay a sanction of one kind or another. And during the course of history, those sanctions have sometimes been very terrible. It's in this respect in which religions in history and in their orthodox manifestations now, plus in all their manifestations, tend to share with other kinds of totalizing ideologies. So that's why it's no great surprise that Joseph Stalin, for example, was educated in the seminary. What those totalitarianisms share is very, very common. [unintelligible] inquisition in Spain in the 15th century and Stalin's Soviet Union in the 20th century say the same thing, We've got the answer, you've got to agree, and if you don't, you're in trouble. So they have these two features, and the second of them, the structural feature, the idea of being in charge of the truth or of possessing the right story about life in the universe is very opposed to the enlightenment outlook on which our modern Western liberal democracies are based, the enlightenment of the 18th century taught us to think that there isn't one right answer for everybody. It taught us pluralism, taught us individual autonomy, it taught us liberty of conscience, it taught us democracy. Democracy is about people having a conversation, the great conversation of society in which we negotiate with one another about how we go forward, how we organize ourselves in society, and that's very different indeed from thinking that there is one great ruler, one monarch, whether in the sky or on the ground, who tells us what we should do, and that we mustn't think for ourselves, but we must all be orthodox, and indeed this ethical point is a very important one. There are those people who think that you can't have religion -- you can't have morality without religion, and of course, that isn't true. Everything good about religious morality, loving your neighbor, kindness, concern for others, responsibility as a member of the community, is shared by nonreligious ethical outlooks also. They're very common to all the great ethical theories. I'm an atheist and a humanist, and those values matter deeply to me. If you look at ancient Greek philosophy for example, a dominant strain of thought for nearly 1,000 years before Christianity came to command the mind of Europe, and you see that those values were shared by those thinkers, not because they thought they were told them by a deity but because reason and human experience had offered it to them. And the final point is this. People say, What's wrong with moderate religion? you know, those nice folks who go to church on Sundays and who take part in their neighborhoods. And here's the problem with that, moderate religion is religion where people do a little bit of cherry picking.  They take the best bits of the religion, and some of the more embarrassing, or difficult, or awkward, or rebarbative bits they leave to one side. I know very, very few Christians who give away all they own to the poor, who take no thought for tomorrow, who turn their backs on their families if their families disagree and families are going to disagree if they do give away everything, who don't marry, who stay celibate. I find very few Christians actually live the New Testament morality, they cherry pick. Unkind people would call that hypocrisy. At the other end of the scale, however, are those who take their religion extremely seriously, the extremists, we call it them. The point about the extremists is that they are the most honest of the people who have a religious view because they commit themselves to what their tradition tells them, and they stay closest to the text. Now, if that's real religion, that's honest religion, the world is very much better off without it. And if the world is much better off without the true and the honest form of religion, why not put the hypocrites in with them, too? Thank you. "

    "data":"The caustic and brilliant philosopher at Columbia University, Sidney Morgenbesser, was once sitting in the back of a lecture where the English philosopher, J.L. Austin, said that we know that two negatives make a positive, if I say I will never not miss you, it means I'll always miss you. But he said there's no language in which two positives make a negative. And from the back of the auditorium Morgenbesser said, yeah, right. Now, I'm going to offer you two positives. I hope not only that they will add to a positive but that you will approach this not in that skeptical frame of mind but at least open to the possibility that there's a lot about religion that you don't hear. You will never see a headline that says religious man feeds hungry man. But it happens all the time. In fact you might be surprised to know what the largest aid organization in the world is. It’s called World Vision, with over 40,000 people in over 100 countries. That’s more than CARE, Save the Children, the worldwide operations of the United States Agency for International Development all combined. And if you didn’t know that, it’s because the good that religion does is sort of oft interred with its bones, but you hear about every depredation, every sin, every bad thing. And yet today, all over the world, there are millions of religious aid workers who are sustaining people in places that you’ve never heard of and never visited. Right before this conference, both Dinesh and I were in Mexico in Puebla at the Festival of Ideas, and I rode back to the airport with Nicholas Kristof from the New York Times and we were talking about this issue. And he said, “You know, everywhere I go, I see religious aid workers, day after day, year after year, and the difference,” he said, “between religious aid workers and others is they stay.” They don’t go when the crisis is over. And this parallels my own experience when I was in Haiti, helping a friend rebuild an orphanage. Almost every person I met was a religious aid worker. I remember going to the market in Haiti and I met this man, and I said to him, “What are you doing here?” And he said, “Well, I’m a Mennonite, and I and my group are building homes in the rural areas outside of Port-au-Prince.” So I said, “Why are you doing this?” He said, “Well, I’ve been here for about five or six years, and I came because my son was sent by the church community 20 years ago. And after 15 years of watching my son do this, I thought it’s time for me to go.” This story could be duplicated again and again and again. And, in fact, if tomorrow you took religion out of the world, the world would be tremendously impoverished in terms of the way in which people who are in trouble get help. Evangelical organizations were the first ones on the ground after the tsunami in Indonesia, and that story could be repeated again and again throughout the world. That’s point one. Here’s point two. The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Health is about to come out in 2012, the Second Edition. In case you won’t find the time to read it, I’m now going to save you the time. This is a handbook that anthologizes over 3,000 studies from the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, Lancet, all peer-review journals that are not particularly sympathetic to religion. And this is what it says. Religious Americans give more to charity, volunteer more, participate in civic processes more, attend more meetings, are more likely to vote, to volunteer, less likely to drink, divorce, do drugs. They are much more inclined to be optimistic and feel meaningful about life. They’re less inclined to depression, less inclined to suicide, less inclined to suicidal thoughts. They are much more helpful in their communities. If you want to measure altruism and empathy, the best measure is not age, gender, income, education. It’s whether you’re involved in a religious community. I’ll give you one study at the University of Miami. They studied people who’d been diagnosed with AIDS, whether they turned to religion or away from religion. Those who turned to religion, several months later, had lower viral loads, lower CD4 [spelled phonetically] counts. They were healthier than those who didn’t. In fact, religion, if you’re part of a religious community as measured by attending services and reading Scripture and praying, it adds on average seven years to your life if you’re a white American male, 14 years if you’re an African American male. Now, the dean of this research, Harold Koenig at Duke University says that he has to point out to you that you may spend those seven years in church, but nonetheless, you have to decide what you want to do with the time. Still, you have the time to do it. All of this is a way of emphasizing that religion and being part of a religious community does enormous good. I see it day after day, week after week. The little nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and of love about which Wordsworth wrote, that’s what religious people do and in part because it’s a system that encourages goodness, which is why when a religious person does something wrong, people get particular upset. “How can he do this?” He’s supposed to be religious. Every time someone complains about the synagogue, the call begins as follows: “How, in a synagogue, could you…” which is a way of saying you’re supposed to aspire to be better. And that’s exactly right. Mother Teresa was once tending to the wounds of a leper in Calcutta. And wiping the separating wounds from this sick and dying person. And a journalist who'd been following her around for several days said to her, I wouldn't do that for a million dollars. And without looking up, she said, Neither would I. It's true. Many people of all different beliefs and no beliefs do good in this world. But if you want to find an organized system that encourages people to be better, to transcend themselves, that seeks to make the world colorful, kind, compassionate, giving, good, a system that often fails but at least aspires to that, not in little enclaves of this class or this school, but worldwide, consistently, the only one we have ever had is religion. The world without it would be a poorer, sadder and crueler place. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you. I am not a professional like these guys, so I'm going to read my notes. I apologize. Religion makes two big claims: God really exists, and religion makes us behave better. But does religion make us behave better? To partially answer that question, let me read you a verse or two from the Bible. Deuteronomy, Chapter 25, Verses 11 and 12. When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him and putteth forth a hand and taketh him by the secrets, then shalt thou cut off her hand. Roughly translated, this means that if you're in a fight, and your wife tries to help you by grabbing your opponent's balls, you should chop her hand off. It's there. I mean, I can show you. I know it's kind of cheap to poke fun at the Bible because it's so easy, but -- but there is -- there is a serious point here, which is that far from making us behave better, religion often complicates and distorts morality. By any reasonable standards, hacking bits off your wife is far worse than her squeezing your enemy's nuts. The thing is that in almost any holy book, you can find something that will validate just about anything. And afterwards, you don't have to defend the humanity of your actions or take responsibility because God told you to do it. Believe it or not, there's more atheism up here than faith. A.C. Grayling and I are atheists. David and Dinesh are too, except when it comes to their own religion. Every other religion, they're atheist about. This is why religion is divisive. Everyone on earth wants food, water, shelter, love, for their children to grow up to be happy and in a peaceful world. These common desires are so profound they ought to make war an absurdity, a violence against self. Religion, however, makes everyone an infidel to someone. But we're no longer ignorant, isolated tribes who think the earth is flat and don't know what lies around the corner. We have photographs of our planet from space. And most of us have met people of many races. We know our world and who we share it with. And we also know that critical worldwide problems will require worldwide unity. In this context, religion's continuing assistance, insistence that my God is better than yours is disastrous, which leads me to credulity. There are literally thousands of gods available. Which one you believe in is really just an accident of birth. If David and Dinesh had been born in Afghanistan, they'd both be Muslim probably. Or they'd be dead. Like most people -- like most believers, however, they have faith in their inherited gods. They haven't tested the rest because there's far too many of them. How then do they know that their god exists and the other gods don't or that their god is better than the other gods? Because they've been told by an authority figure. And here's how he did it. He said, our God is supreme, but he's invisible. We have no proof he exists. But if you have faith, if you make a big effort to believe in him, you will believe in him. It's fantastic. They take the weakest point of the argument and make it a condition of entry so you overlook it. But if, in the most important area of your life, your philosophy no less, the first thing you learn as a child is that faith is absolutely essential, and evidence absolutely isn't, how can this not affect the way you think about everything? You've been brain washed to be credulous and submissive to authority. This affects many aspects of life, including the functioning of democracy and the understanding of science, both of which demand that you insist on evidence, question everything and take nothing on faith from anyone. Here's an example. Evolution through natural selection over billions of years is one of the best supported theories in science. But 40 to 50 percent of Americans believe the earth is only six to 8,000 years old and that God made us as we are now. Nearly 50 percent -- I mean, it's really extraordinary. It's unheard of in any other culture except Muslim countries. I've written widely on this subject and met creationists of all types. Often, they have -- I'd say usually they have no idea what evolution is. But they dispute it with passion from a religious standpoint, faith over reason. Evidence infuriates them, as does science itself. And this antipathy to science has slowed down stem cell research, continues to harm the health of women and girls and contributes to cynicism about scientific issues like global warming. But none of this captures the human suffering caused by religion. I grew up next to my gay uncle and his partner. When I was nine, I discovered they faced long prison sentences if their homosexuality was revealed. This was justified by Leviticus 20:13. And the verse was often quoted by both politicians and the clergy. If a man lieth with a man as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. This barbaric verse is still used by Christians, including Catholics and evangelicals. And violence is only its most obvious consequence. I end where I began. Religion claims to provide morality. But as can be seen in its divisiveness, its homophobia and in its almost universal subjugation of women, it just as often deforms morality. The question isn't whether religion can sometimes do good. Of course it can and has. The question is, can we come up with something better that does not depend on dangerous and childish faith and thousands of competing gods? Can we persuade people that it's possible to live a good, peaceful and happy life guided only by human conscience and modern knowledge? When people who believe in martyrdom and an afterlife will soon get weapons of mass destruction, I think we have to, that we can and that we will. And that's why I ask you to support the motion that the world would be better off without religion. Thank you. "

    "data":"It's my peculiar fate in this debate to be speaking last and therefore to have to digest the statements of the other speakers. I must say this puts me an odd position. I feel a bit like the mosquito in a nudist colony. I'm not sure where to begin. I guess I'll begin by noting that there were two definitions that have been advanced by the other side that actually I think help our case. The first one is the idea that people who have religious beliefs are hypocritical. But notice that in making this accusation what was being alleged is that religious believers have ideals higher than they can live up to. And this is advanced as hypocrisy, in other words, holding up to a standard and falling short of it. Now, that is actually not hypocrisy. If you read the Bible, Jesus doesn't call people hypocrites because their ideals are too high. He calls people hypocrites who pretend to be one thing and are really another. The problem with the Pharisees wasn't that they had high principles, is that they didn't have principles but they pretended to be something they weren't, so we've seen a subtle shift in the meaning of hypocrisy, a shift that is advanced by the atheist side, why? To basically pull down the moral ideals that we hold up that are higher than ourselves. That I would suggest is a very bad thing. Now, Matthew made the argument that religion is a function of where you're born. If you were born in India, you're going to be a Hindu -- actually I was born in India, I was raised Catholic, but never mind -- that your religious identity is formed as a result of where you're born. If you're born in Afghanistan you're a Muslim and so on. Well I think this applies to all our beliefs. Let's say for example that somebody born in Oxford, England is more likely to subscribe to the theory of evolution than someone born in Oxford, Mississippi. Somebody who is born in New York City is more likely to have formed Einstein's theory of relativity than someone born in New Guinea. Now what does that say about whether evolution and relativity are true? Nothing. The fact of your birth is irrelevant to the merit of the idea, so there's a kind of sleight of hand here, you have to judge the ideas by their own merits. Now, would the world be better without religion? You can't answer that question without looking to see what religion has done in the world, but you've got to compare it to what the world would be like without religion. There's been some allusion to the boring crimes of religion, but let me suggest that those crimes, even the worst of them, are infinitesimal compared to the crimes of atheist regimes that are far greater in magnitude, far longer in duration, and actually are still going on. If you consider, for example, a tragedy like the inquisition, a crime, I admit it, and yet over 400 years the Spanish Inquisition killed fewer than 2,000 people, 2,000. The Salem Witch Trials I heard about when I came to America, and then my wife and I a few years ago went to Salem, Massachusetts, it's a really interesting place -- I do want to report, the witches today are doing great, most of them are tourist guides -- but if you pick up one of their brochures, the number of people killed in the Salem Witch Trials, 19, 19. Now, is that 19 too many? Yeah, or if you want to add it up, 2,019. But while the atheists cry inconsolable crocodile tears over the crimes of religion, they ignore the vastly greater crimes of atheism. Now, am I talking about Stalin in Russia and Mao in China? Not even really, that's just the tip of the atheist iceberg. If you dig deeper, there is a massive procession underneath. In the Soviet Union alone, starting with Lenin you continue through Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko, a procession of Soviet dictators, but what about Ceausescu and [unintelligible], Fidel Castro, Kim Jong Il, Pol Pot, I mean, Pol Pot is such a junior league atheist people don't even mention him. And yet in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, his Khmer Rouge regime in the space of about three years managed to kill two million people, two million. Even bin Laden in his wildest dreams has not even come close, but who should parachute into the discussion at this critical moment but Richard Dawkins in his book, The God Delusion, and he goes, Wait a minute. We've got to make a crucial distinction here. You might've had some tyrants who killed -- who happened to be atheist, but they didn't kill in the name of atheism. The Christians killed in the name of Christianity. Now, Richard Dawkins is a respected biologist, and I think here you begin to see the problem, when a biologist is allowed to leave the laboratory. Why? Because evidently the poor man knows no history, all you have to do is crack open the collected works of Karl Marx, and you will see that the atheism is not incidental, it's not some add on, it's intrinsic to the whole ideological scheme, Marx famously calls religion, the opium, a kind of drug of the masses. And his point is you’ve got to get rid of religion in order to establish the new man and the new Utopia freed from the shackles of traditional religion and traditional morality. Often when we think of secular society, we think of Europe. But Europe isn’t really secular. Europe is a product of 2,000 years of Jewish and Christian civilization. Even today if there’s a famine in Rwanda, while much of the world ignores it, the European countries, the Western countries begin to send to food and aid, Doctors without Borders, the Red Cross. My point is this is the result of a religious training and a religious habit of mind that remains. Nietzsche once said that if we get rid of God, we’ve got to get rid of shadows of God. In other words, the ideas that Judaism and Christianity brought into the West and into the world, those will begin to erode as well. Dostoevsky said a long time ago, “If God is not, everything is permitted.” And Dostoevsky’s point is that when we get rid of transcendence, when we create a world without religion, we license terrible calamities. So, in the names of the thousands and hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of souls who have died, I would say from their point of view, the world would have been a lot better off if it had religion. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you very much. Let's begin with a thought experiment. Just imagine that you work at JFK International Airport here in New York City, and you're in a Federal Express facility inspecting incoming packages that have just been pulled off of a jet that's landed from Heathrow Airport in London. And you're clearing these parcels that can be taken on across America and delivered to their destinations. And you see a package from Somalia, and it's addressed to a synagogue in San Francisco. Hmm, you think to yourself, that's kind of unusual. So you call over your supervisor, you take a look at it, you discuss the package, and you decide that you're going to put it aside until a bomb-sniffing dog can come over and render its opinion on the matter. Congratulations, you just engaged in profiling. Now, obviously, packages are not people. Fed Ex boxes have neither civil rights nor emotions. People do and we always must be aware of and sensitive to that. However, in a world of limited time, personnel, and money, we have no choice but to focus on those people who threaten to destroy aircraft and the flying public who ride within them. And that is why my team and I urge you to vote in favor of tonight's resolution, U.S. airports should use racial and religious profiling. Let me emphasize that we do not advocate letting airport security personnel cater to their own personal ethnic or ecclesiastical biases. Instead, we want the TSA and others to recognize that the current threat to passengers and airliners comes almost exclusively from one source, and we all know what it is, young males between about 18 and 35 who practice a fundamentalist strain of the Islamic faith, and generally hail from the Middle East, as well as largely Muslim nations in Africa and South Asia. There are exceptions to this profile, but they're quite rare indeed. We learned about this profile on September 11 when all the hijackers who attacked us that day fit the parameters that I've identified. Had the security personnel at Newark, Dulles, or Boston-Logan Airports profiled these hijackers, they might have been stopped and nearly 3,000 people who were killed on 9/11 would be with us here today. In a few minutes you will hear from my colleague, Asra Nomani. She will demonstrate that this profile did not begin on September 11 and it did not end then either. My colleague, Bob Baer, a former intelligence officer, will explain that what we advocate is a response to intelligence. He also will show that preventing terror at and through America's airports involves responding to the evolving threat profile that faces us at any given time. Now, mind you, we are not arguing that the TSA should send anyone named Mohammed to be water boarded somewhere between the first class lounge and the Pizza Hut. However, if you are a male between about 18 and 35 and are traveling on a Middle Eastern passport or one from a predominantly Muslim country, it might be smart to ask you a few extra questions, carefully peruse your papers, and if things seem unusual we perhaps should take a closer look at your luggage. This really is not religious or racial profiling so much as it is terrorist profiling. We want to increase, not decrease, the probability that our security personnel will stop terrorists before they can board passenger jets, and once again turn them into bombs and missiles. This differs little from what police departments do today to deploy their limited resources in order to raise the odds of successfully reducing crime. If the NYPD were seeking a mafia hit man who just flew in from Naples to whack somebody, I doubt the NYPD would dispatch squad cars to 125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard. If you set up a sobriety checkpoint, if you’re a police department, you most likely would put it somewhere near bars, not close to churches. Similarly, if a wave of bank robberies were committed by a black man between ages 45 and 50, and if he were just under six feet tall, and lived in Manhattan’s East Village, I would not be shocked if the police stopped me and asked me a few questions. Why? I perfectly fit that profile. Now, would that leave me thrilled and delighted? Probably not, but I would know that these law enforcement officers were doing their jobs, and that, I would understand. Does my team advocate violating people’s rights? Absolutely not. Remember, among the rights that officials need to protect is the right to fly on a plane and assume that it will land at your destination with you and your fellow passengers alive and well at your destination. That right deserves maximum attention from those who we pay to keep us safe from those who want us dead. Our opponents might say that the profile we've identified would miss someone like Timothy McVeigh, the non-Muslim man who blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. However, to look more carefully at someone does not mean that you ignore everyone else. This resolution is not an either/or proposition. Terrorist profiling can exist with wisely applied traditional screening measures for other passengers. Finally, what if we avoid terrorist profiling? At best, we will keep wasting scarce resources by subjecting everyone to the same time consuming often humiliating searches that have generated such public outrage recently. The TSA can keep checking the prosthetic breasts of American women who have endured mastectomies as happened a few months ago to Cathy Bossi, a 32-year veteran airline employee. At worst, TSA officers might come face-to-face with a bomb-wielding passenger who fits the terrorist profile but then breezed him through security because they don’t want to make him uncomfortable. The result could be a deadly airborne attack that we all have feared since September 11. My team wants to prevent this from happening and we hope you do, too. Please join us in supporting tonight’s resolution, “U.S. Airports should use racial and religious profiling.” Thank you very much. "

    "data":"I stand in opposition to the resolution that U.S. airports should use racial and religious profiling and I do so not only as the sister of someone who died at the hands of terrorists in the cockpit of his commercial airliner but also as someone who worked in that industry for many years. I did so in the late 1970s into the 80s at a time when aviation became the obsessive focus of international terrorists and trans-national terrorist organizations. It is different now. It has evolved and it has gotten a lot more complicated. The environment up there is basically the same. The reason for my opposition is simple. It simply doesn’t work. It results in a waste of time and resources. It is counterproductive and by that I mean it causes more harm than any good, any putative good. For those of you sitting in this audience who are neither Arab looking nor South Asian looking, I ask you to contemplate, think back the last time you were at the airport if you were ever pulled out of line when you didn’t expect it and you hadn’t said or done anything wrong and maybe even treated a little peremptory way because the airport recently maybe an unexpected engagement that was quite unwanted and maybe even by your definition quite humiliating. I ask you, for those of you who have been through that who are not Arab looking or South Asian looking or Muslim looking, I ask you to consider what it would be like to experience that every time you go to the airport on every time you fly. It would appear to you, it would feel not like a security measure but a grave injustice because you would be singled out, not for anything you said or did, as I said, you would be singled out simply for the level of melatonin in your skin. And make no mistake, the TSOs who are doing this will not know what country you are from. In fact U.S. travel documents don’t indicate that. Maybe perhaps if you’re showing your ID where you were born. But basically when they’re picking you out of the line, all they’re going by is how you appear. Now I frankly don’t know how U.S. airports would profile on religion because religion is something that’s in your heart or on your head. And I believe that there would be a legal challenge if this question were asked at the airport or if it were somehow required to be in your travel documents or your ID. I think it would fail the Constitutional challenge. So what are they going by? They’re going to be going by, what, head scarves. I will only bring you to the example of the airport security video that was published. You can see it on YouTube of the hijackers on my brother's plane going through Dulles. They look like your typical American people. They're wearing dress shirts and Chinos. And there is nothing in that video that would suggest to you that they are a terrorist or that they are Muslim or that they hate infidels and want to kill them. Not a thing. And I thank you, Deroy. They would thank you, future terrorists, for giving them a blueprint in your description of what not to look like the next time they come to the airport. Thank you. I hope I pick up some votes there. I'm in favor of behavioral profiling. And I believe that does work. I think we should stop focusing on things. Yes, packages aren’t people. We should focus on behavior because the moment we profile on status, the enemy will seize on it and go in a different direction. I'm going to give you -- try to give you three examples very quick on how behavioral profiling has been very successfully used. There are lots and lots of examples. But here are three that I think are pretty good. I'm going to try and make it under the limit. A guy by the name of Benni Norris, aka, Ahmed Ressam. He was the millennium bomber. He rented a car to get from Canada on the car ferry over into Port Angeles, Washington. At the state of Washington, a very astute customs agent saw him. He had filled out his customs forms incorrectly, so he was singled out, tapped for secondary screening. Her colleague says, “Oh, Diana, we want to go home. It's Christmas time. It's the last car, the last ferry, let it go.” She said, “No, there's something wrong about this guy.” And here is what was wrong. He was sweating profusely in cold, freezing weather in December. She asked him some questions. That went badly. She asked him to open up his trunk. Bingo, explosives, det cords, a map of LAX. He was done. Mohammad al-Qahtani, the so-called 20th hijacker who came in through Orlando airport, a Saudi national who was, again, brought -- tapped for secondary screening. The inspector asked him questions. His answers were all wrong. He had $2,800 in cash, one way ticket, no return ticket, no hotel, no credit cards, no visible means of managing in six days of vacation travel on 2800 bucks alone. It went downhill from there. But he got turned around. Basically he was given the choice of leaving or going through court proceedings. He left. The next time we saw him was at Tora Bora, the battle of Tora Bora. He ended up at Guantanamo. And the final one I'll give you -- and again, there are many, many more -- that's Zacarias Moussaoui. He presented himself as a businessman, Moroccan born, French accent, businessman from France who wanted to buy simulator time on a Boeing 747 400, the biggest passenger plane in the sky. But he didn't make sense. And two very astute flight instructors -- I like to say their names because they're heroes. Hugh Sims and Tim Nelson, they thought it was awfully weird that a businessman would be paying for his sim time in a plane that he didn't have any understanding of with 68 100-dollar bills. They pressed their employer to call the FBI, and the rest is history. I could go on and on about the morality or the immorality of doing this. But I'll leave that to my teammates. Please vote for us. Thank you. "

    "data":"I want to first thank all of you for coming to talk about this really important discussion. We all know it's in the news. We know that it is something that matters to us personally. And I want to thank the panel from the other side and my own teammates for daring to talk about something that is so sensitive that oftentimes it is a taboo topic. And it especially is one inside of our Muslim community. It is one that hurts us. It is one that causes me great pain to actually come and speak to you about. When I first got the invitation, the assumption was that I would be speaking against the motion. But after several years of pondering on this really difficult topic, I firmly believe that U.S. airports should profile based on religion and racial issues. I came to this country at the age of four in the summer of 1969 on a TWA jet from Bombay to John F. Kennedy airport. Ever since then, I have loved travel. I have loved the airline industry. I came from a very conservative Muslim family. Islam has been a part of my life. It's been a part of my being. But something very sad has happened in the 40 years since, both inside of our Muslim community and inside of the airline industry. Inside of our Muslim community, we have had the emergence of a very real interpretation of Islam that justifies the attack on airports and airliners and civilian targets. This is a reality that is really difficult to accept sometimes inside of our community. But it's a truth. And I want to chronicle how this unfolded over these recent years. And inside of the airline industry, we have seen Pan Am leave us. We have seen TWA die off. The airline industry is also under great pressure. Airplane crashes, airline security issues have serious consequences, not just on the traveling public but on this really important industry. And this issue of profiling has been the taboo topic in the midst of all of this conversation. I do come from a Muslim family. I am brown, for radio audience members who can't see me. My father has Mohammed in his name. He's 80-some years old, but he gets pulled at the security checkpoint. And still I stand before you and I say, profile me. Profile my family. Profile my father because inside of our Muslim community, I fundamentally believe that we have failed to police ourselves. We have failed our country here in America. We have failed our world. I express my deepest sorrow and sympathy to Debra, to all of you who have felt the trauma of September 11. And I recognize that we as a nation, both in the U.S. and inside of our Muslim communities, have largely not yet even healed. We are struggling with how to deal with this very real incredible threat that exists out there. And religion, ethnicity and issues of race have a very direct relationship with issues of violence. A wonderful study by the State University of New York at Albany concluded, what makes terrorist organizations more lethal is religious ideology. When you combine religion and ethno-nationalism, you get a dangerous combination. We saw that dangerous combination on September 11. It was the manifestation of an interpretation inside of our Muslim world that justified an attack on an airport and on airliners. There was a fatwa issued by Osama Bin Laden in 1998 when he had created the international Islamic front for fighting the Jews and crusaders. And he established very clearly in his marching orders, “Bring down their aircraft. Have the attack be one of violence that is pitiless.” He was very clear in what his objective was. And I have before me a Koran that comes from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And I want to establish really clearly that this ideology is one that permeates inside of our community, giving young men then the religious justification to do that which they want. And in it it says “Guide us to the straight way.” It's a very simple message. But what the government of Saudi Arabia has done is added into here, “unlike the way of the Jews and the Christians.” And so this ideology is the ideology that fuels the extremism that makes airports and airliners targets. And it's not just the stuff of rhetoric. Bojinka, 1990s, plot by Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to bring down jetliners coming from Asia to the U.S. Scotland, Glasgow, airport attack attempt, the millennium bomber attempt in the Los Angeles Airport was also a successful event, not at just behavioral profiling, but a warning had gone out to look out for men of Middle Eastern origin, and so the customs officials actually had an eye out for the man who was trying to put bombs on baggage carts at Los Angeles Airport. And 2007, JFK Airport, that airport where I arrived, there were young Muslim men who said, Let us attack John F. Kennedy International Airport because any time you hit Kennedy it is the most hurtful thing to the United States, to hit John F. Kennedy, wow, they love John F. Kennedy, like, he's the man. If you hit that, this whole country will be mourning. You can kill the man twice. This is the stuff of the operations and the actual attacks that are inside of our community. I'm not happy that this is happening inside of our community, but I tell you that we must be honest about it, and I urge you to vote for the motion that U.S. airports should use religious and racial profiling. Thank you so much. "

    "data":"Thank you very much. First, it’s a great honor and privilege to be here today. I would like to right in the beginning just be very clear about the topic. And let’s exactly focus on what we are looking at. U.S. should profile based on racial and religious identity. This whole discussion and debate about liberty and security is not a new one. Even the cabdriver who brought me here, because I was coming from Colombia, it was about 40-minute drive so we started discussing the issue. He was from South Asia. And when I was trying to explain him -- I was looking at my notes and trying to explain to him what this debate is about where he was taking me, he said -- he stopped me because he was listening to the NPR the whole day, he said, Well, you are talking about these Swedish grandma, Swedish grandmas who have to be patted down. And I said, No, this is not -- be focused --. The central issue I would argue is not about the different ways and mechanisms and the different strategies, that will be used in profiling, there are three fundamental issues, the first and the foremost is about whether it is legal and constitutional, secondly, what law enforcement tells you, what these different police organizations, there are so many people who are involved in the security sector, what is their general consensus, and the third, and I think a very important point, is what is the impact of this policy on the social fabric of society? First, very clearly, it is illegal and unlawful. Why? When we are saying that a person of a certain religious identity, certain religious belief will be checked, how will you do that? You'll ask them -- as Debra rightly pointed out, whether you'll ask them to bring their ID cards, or you will ask, Muslims within the United States about five million or so and all Muslims from around the world to bring an ID, whether they are Muslim. So by that definition, and I’ll [unintelligible] have to ask them to also to bring this ID whether they’re Christian, whether they’re Jewish, whether they’re Hindu. My argument is that is in principle a violation of the Constitution. Let’s leave even this argument on the side and let me move on to something which is more profound which is that this kind of religious profiling and racial profiling is not something which is an isolated thing at the airport. This is something which transcends, you start looking at that community in a way that is “Okay these are the guys who are always stopped at the airport because they pose a certain threat.” It has an impact on the job opportunities for that community. It has an impact on their status in society. It has an impact on the kids. And I give you a few examples also about how perhaps later on, examples which tell you what the kids from these communities, Muslim community here we are talking about, go through because then there is a threatened environment where you blame the whole community and to Asra with all due respect. I am absolutely not ready to apologize for all the bigots and the narrow-minded people who conduct terrorism. I would argue, just look at the data bases. There’s a new study which is not mentioned, only in the academic circles, but was mentioned in 2010 on CNN. It tells you very clearly that the whole threat about extremism coming from the Muslims is an exaggerated thing. Look at the latest Rand study, it’s a major think tank, it’s not some small research institute in some corner. It’s a major think-tank getting funding from U.S. government also. Rand Corporation says the total number of terrorism incidences which involved radicals from the U.S. --were 46. In some cases there was only one person involved, in other cases, about three people. It’s another matter how many of them were convicted. But just compare this data set which is on the FBI’s website. Compare the total number of terrorist attacks within the United States from 1970 to 2009. It is so very clear. The number of terrorist attacks, for example, those that were happening in 1970’s where much more lethal, from much more diverse communities. So the larger argument I am making is we need smarter strategies. We need strategies which will be able to utilize with limited resources. Another issue, related to this is, this often is a cover-up, a cover-up for bureaucratic incompetence and their failures. It’s very easy for them to say because we our intelligence has failed because of all the different ways we could have profiled those terrorists have failed, if you cannot distinguish between a Pakistani Taliban or an Afghan Taliban and so many other groups. The tendency is to just call all of them al Qaeda, on one side, just call--on the other side are people who are Taliban. It is very important to note how many of these groups are posing a terror threat to the United States. I’m not interested in the total number of terrorist attacks all over the world. The suicide bombers in Sri Lanka or what’s happening with the Islamic movement in Uzbekistan in Central Asia or the suicide attacks in Pakistan for that matter. I am as a Pakistani-American interested in those people who are attacking or who are posing a direct threat to the United States. Look at the data set in the last nine years and it will make it very obvious. One last personal anecdote and there are many other arguments about the legality of the whole issue that I’ll come to later, I would even argue that racial and religious profiling is already taking place. Just a brief anecdote. I have hardly a minute or so to tell you. I am an academic. I teach at Columbia, previously at Harvard as was mentioned. About six, seven months ago I was invited to go and give a lecture to the NATO officers in Germany who were about to be deployed to Afghanistan. And on the way back and by the way the last 10 years despite all my academic work and my work about militants, I always am screened and that’s fine. As a former law enforcement officer, here I agree [unintelligible]. I’m absolutely fine with that. But if I am stopped every time. The last time the question I was asked “So what were you teaching.” I said “About terrorism.” They said “Really? So did the NATO officers pay you?” I said yes. “Whether that cash is in your bag?” I said “No, that cash is not in my bag.” But I was stunned. I would like to tell you and I am about to be done with my time, my question is I’m fine when I’m profiled. But when I’m traveling with my family and every time my daughters ask me, after four hours of waiting that “Baba, Dad, are you a criminal? Have you committed some terrorist attack?” I would like to -- "

    "data":"Thank you. You know, all these arguments are telling. But I'm going to approach profiling from -- first I'd like to say that I have a daughter from Pakistan. And I have a lot of Pakistani visas. And she's from Faisalabad, it's from a center of terror, a lot of terrorists have come there. And I would fit that profile as well. And I'll say it now. I don't mind being stopped. And I have been stopped. But we have -- you have to look at this -- what I think is a mistake is if we let this devolve, this argument, into Islam against the West or the United States against the West. Let me take an example. It may seem a bit facetious, but it's a very real one. The secret service has a source inside the Aryan brotherhood. A source says there's going to be an attempt on a black American president. It's going to take place inside Washington, D.C. And that's all the details I have. Maybe it's going to be a rocket. Maybe it's going to be a service to air missile that can hit a helicopter. The D.C. police are informed, the FBI, Homeland Security. And all we know at this point is it's probably going to take place in a week. What does the secret service do [unintelligible] the FBI. They do triage. They are going to be looking for white males with tattoos, short haircuts, frequenting certain places of a certain economic stature. Those people are going to be profiled. So I think it's important to get away from this is a crusade against Islam because that's not what it is. Let's take the Israelis. Whatever side you come down on that, they have a certain experience in the Middle East. Call it profiling, call it what you will. I was in Lebanon in the '80s. And their assumption when they invaded in 1982 is they were going to have a problem with Palestinian Muslims. By 1987, the problem was not with Palestinian Muslims. It was with Christian women. First suicide bombers were Christian and women. Their profile went from religion to a fairly light Maronite and orthodox Christians. The whole idea of profiling has to do with triage. If you're TSA or the FBI or the CIA, you have a limited amount of time, and you have to understand the background and the religion of people. Let's take Iran today. Everybody calls it a terrorist state. But give me one example when an Iranian has committed suicide either on a plane or a car bomb or anywhere else. They just don't do it. Look at the history going back to 1980. Yes, they did on the front. But they were never involved in terrorism. If I am the TSA supervisor, and you have a plane and a threat, and you can only check a certain amount of people, I would write off the Iranians first of all. Within Islam, there is profiling in Saudi Arabia. They can pinpoint the cities, the villages and the school of Islam that is likely to commit suicide bombings. When's the last time there's been a bombing on a Saudi airline? Hasn't been one. They know who's getting on. And they can identify the religious school which happens to be Hanafi, that has a proclivity for this. Yes, they profile. But at the end of the day, we -- the problem is we are a liberal society. Our intelligence, having served 21 years in the CIA and having tried and failed many times, is not good. We are not the Israelis. The Israelis know every single Palestinian, who gets on, who's safe, who needs to be searched, who doesn't. Scanners don't do it. You can take PETN and you can insert it in a cavity, and the chances of a scanner picking this up are remote. Behavior, look at the 9/11 bombers. They went to bars the night before. They were drinking. If the FBI had been after them, they wouldn't have fit a profile for -- nothing in their behavior before -- they didn't go to the mosque. They didn't do any preaching, anything like that. And once they got on the airplane, I have seen the film. They looked pretty normal to me. But had TSA been around, and had they looked at this, they could have figured out where those -- the muscle 15 came from in Saudi Arabia, and say, yes, that school of Islam had a proclivity for doing suicide bombings. Another thing, we go back to triage and why this profiling is in a sense repulsive because it is based on a certain amount of racism. Let's face it. But there isn't a choice. And because the triage changes from day to day, you look at the Tamils, there's still a war going on. If you're at JFK, and you get a threat to Air India, it's going to be a suicide bomber, and Air India and TSA have to go through triage. They are going to be looking at people who are darker, because the Tamils are. They're Hindus. They have certain names. And in no way is this -- you are selecting them out for a secondary search. This will happen in almost any good airport in the world. I just came back from Sydney. They stopped me. They wanted to know who I was. I'm white, middle class. Don't look like a suicide bomber. But they did a credit check at the airport, pulled me aside because I was an American. I realize it doesn’t have anything to do with religion, but they profiled me. They established who I was. I was let on that airplane. So this is why I urge that as difficult a decision it is, that we have to profile to help our intelligence services. And there isn't a choice. "

    "data":"I want to -- I want to praise my adversaries because they've done on eloquent job of arguing for a different proposition than the one you were asked to vote on a few moments ago. The proposition here is, do we engage in racial or religious profiling? And the answer to that, I submit, is no. The proposition they argued for is do we engage in behavioral profiling. Do we look at characteristics of people's behavior, where they went to school, where they traveled, things that they might have done, people they might have known. And do we use that as part of the basis for determining whether we need to take a closer look at them. And I think the answer to that is yes. That's good law enforcement. It's good intelligence. But it's not based on race or religion. It's based upon things that people do, places they go, schooling they've had, people they associate with, people they communicate with, people who buy their tickets. You know, Robert Baer talked about the 9/11 hijackers not being susceptible to behavioral profiling. I had the responsibility for investigating that and for authorizing the prosecution of Moussaoui, and I can tell you, had we in fact examined their behavior going back over a period of time, we would have seen the connections to radicals and extremists that would have tipped us off, that we should have taken a closer look. That's a great argument for behavioral profiling, it's a lousy argument for racial or religious profiling. You know, Deroy talked about the class of people that he thinks we ought to be looking at, what race and what religion, and the problem is that it's the wrong set of principles to apply here. What is the race we ought to look at? He said, Well, we ought to look at people who are Arabs or people from Muslim countries. Well, does that mean Indians, for example, most of whom were Hindu, some of whom were Buddhists? Does it mean people of Asian descent who live in South Africa? What about Africans and African-Americans? Abdulmutallab came from Nigeria. Does that mean Deroy ought to be pulled aside because he's an African-American? The sad reality is that there is no single group, ethnicity or a group signified by its appearance, that you can identify by looking at them in a way that will tell you that they are an extremist or not an extremist. Let's talk about some of the more notable terrorists that have been apprehended in the last nine years. There's Jose Padilla, not from South Asia, a converted Muslim, came from Chicago. There's Bryant Neal Vinas, came from Long Island, his parents were Catholic, he converted, he went to Pakistan, he trained, he came back to try to blow up subways. Daniel Maldonado went to Somalia. He was born in New Hampshire, again, Catholic parents, converted. None of this would be evident to the naked eye if this person went through the airport. How about this, would you stop, for example, Debra Burlingame as opposed to Asra? Well, according to my adversaries, they'd stop Asra but not Debra because she's blonde and Caucasian. Here's the problem, Colleen LaRose, 46-year-old, blonde hair, blue eyes, Philadelphia, radical extremist, sought to recruit others to blow up a cartoonist in Denmark. On the internet she said, I can evade detection because I do not look like everybody's conception of what an extremist is. And then there was Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, her co-conspirator, another blonde woman, this one with a six-year-old child, who was pregnant. She was another extremist radical. Deroy says, Well, we ought to look at males because we know the males are the ones who are the terrorists. LTTE, the extremist group in Sri Lanka, has trained female suicide bombers, including one who in April, 2006, masqueraded as a pregnant woman in order to kill eight people and wound 27 others. The problem with using racial and religious profiling is it takes you down a road to looking at people who you don’t need to look at and avoiding looking at people that you should look at. The fact is it would be an engraved invitation to al-Qaeda to recruit exactly the kind of people who don’t fit the profile. And this is not speculation. I said this publicly when I was in office, and it’s been said by everybody in the intelligence community, we know that the targeting that al-Qaeda has undertaken in the last four or five years in terms of recruitment has been deliberately aimed at Westerners who have Western passports who don’t fit the stereotype of what a Muslim looks like and who therefore can pass under the principle of racial and religious profiling while we’re spending our time looking at Asra, who we really shouldn’t be worried about. Finally of course I guess there’s the argument that, Well, maybe we don’t look at people’s race because if we do that, based on our past experience, it’s going to basically include everybody, including blonde-haired blue-eyed women like Colleen LaRose and Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, but we ought to look at religion.” But here’s the problem, how are we going to look at religion? Are we going to ask people at the airport what your religion is? Do you think the terrorists are going to say, Oh, I’m a Muslim? No, they’re going to say, I’m a Presbyterian. They’re going to walk in with a big cross, if not a nun’s habit. I mean, the reality is these people are not stupid, and the more you target on obvious but misleading characteristics, the more you invite them to recruit in a pool that doesn’t meet that set of preexisting prejudices and biases. Look, if I believed that it was a foolproof way to tell from someone’s appearance who is dangerous when they get on an airplane, I would say political correctness be dammed, let’s pick people who meet that appearance. Certainly when we have a description of somebody, a particular person, and we’ve had this experience, we will absolutely look to people who fit that description. But the problem is, the proposition that is argued here doesn’t meet those standards. I challenge the adversaries to tell you what is the race, what is the appearance that they would rely upon? I challenge them to tell you how are they going to know what religion people are? Are we going to have to start putting religion on our driver’s license? Should we wear little arm bands? Well, we don’t want to go down that road. We know where that wound up 50 or 60 years ago. I suggest to you, as hard as it is, and it’s tough because we all know that we personally are not terrorists and we don’t like to be searched. But more important when you get on an airplane is we want to be sure the person next to us isn’t a terrorist. And the way to do that is look at behavior, to use intelligence and frankly sometimes to use scanning and screening tools but not to rely upon racial or religious pre-conceptions which will only mislead us and ultimately, frankly, probably cause more damage than good. Thank you. "

    "data":"Okay, I’d like to thank Intelligence Squared, the staff, Bob Rosenkranz, Brian Lehrer and of course, our worthy opponents, for the opportunity to debate the proposition: Global warming is not a crisis. Please keep in mind what the proposition is. It is not a debate over whether the earth has been warming over the past century. Uh, the earth is always warming or cooling, at least a few tenths of a degree. And we’re talking about, so far, something on the order of six tenths of a degree centigrade. We’re not even arguing about whether greenhouse gas emissions are contributing at some level to warming. And they most certainly should or I would suggest it would be very little. Indeed, as far as I can tell, even our opponents do not claim that global warming is a crisis at present. Rather, we are primarily addressing the future. Now, much of the current alarm, I would suggest, is based on ignorance of what is normal for weather and climate. Extreme weather events occur all the time. There’s, there is really no evidence of systematic increases, judging from reports from bodies ranging from the National Hurricane Center to the U.N.’s Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change. In fact, outside the tropics the theory of such storms and variability says that the variability should decrease in a warmer world. Thus, if this is a matter of crisis for where we live the world is in a permanent state of crisis and will be less prone to crisis in a warmer world. Sea level has also been a matter of concern, I think largely because it’s very telegenic, as opposed to a half degree of temperature. And sea level has been increasing since the end of the last Ice Age glaciation, with the most rapid change increase about twelve thousand years ago. In recent centuries the rate has been relatively uniform, averaged over ten year periods. Uh, it amounts to a couple of millimeters per year and this is residual of much larger positive and negative changes locally. Uh, those changes are due to tectonics. And, and the risk, if you’re worried about sea level change, from these changes is larger than it is from warming. The impact of warming on agriculture is not easy to ascertain. But, for example, India has warmed in the second half of the twentieth century and agricultural output has increased greatly. The impact on disease seems dubious at best, according to articles in Lancet. Infectious diseases like malaria are not so much a matter of temperature as of poverty and public health, most notably the elimination of DDT. Malaria is still endemic in Siberia and was once so in Michigan. Exposure, I would suggest, to cold is generally found to be both more dangerous and less comfortable. Now, recently the IPCC summary for policy maker came out and it had an iconic claim about man’s impact on temperature change. Uh, does this imply crisis? Well, the impact on temperature per unit carbon dioxide actually goes down, not up, with increasing CO2. Uh, the role of anthropogenic greenhouse gases is not directly related to the emissions rate or even CO2 levels, which is what the legislation is hitting on, but rather to the impact of these gases on the greenhouse effect. Uh, modelers use double CO2 as a convenient benchmark and on the basis of current models, it’s claimed that this should lead to about one and a half to four and a half degrees warming. What is less often noted is in terms of greenhouse forcing we’re already three quarters of the way to that doubling. And we’ve only seen point six degrees. And there’s no reason to suppose, furthermore, that this is all due to man. Now, this certainly does not support the model forecasts upon which alarm is based. Modelers commonly claim it’s still possible that aerosols have canceled much of the greenhouse warming. Unfortunately, the impact of aerosols is considered by the IPCC to be virtually unknown. And indeed, many people consider that canceling the warming involves a larger effect than seems plausible. There have also been claims that warming has been delayed by the ocean. But the results I’ve mentioned are from coupled models involving the atmosphere in the ocean. And in many of these the oceans have been tuned to have particularly long delays. And I think it’s crucial to distinguish between the claim that models can display past behavior from the actual situation, which is that models can be adjusted to display past behavior once that behavior is known. There is no reason to suppose that the adjustment corrected the relevant error. It is worth adding that warming, instead of accelerating, has been essentially absent for about the last ten years. So the iconic statement is itself not indicative of crisis. And one could, if one had time, explain why the iconic statement itself may very well not be true. The major defense of the statement is modelers cannot think of anything else that gave warming over the last thirty years. But these are the same models that cannot account for the Medieval warm period, or for that matter, even do a good job of replicating El Nino. So even the basis for the iconic statement is not particularly meaningful. So crisis is not a product of current observations. I suggest it’s not even a product of projections. Now, there is no reason to suppose that anything will cause a threshold to change this assessment. We’re still talking about a two per cent imbalance and we’re also talking about the impact of CO2 per unit CO2 that decreases. This is not the usual condition for a threshold. Moreover, there are positive reasons to suspect that greenhouse warming is not significant. The real signature of greenhouse warming is not surface temperature but temperature in the middle of the troposphere, about five kilometers. And that is going up even slower than the temperature at the surface. Finally, the underlying present concern is not the greenhouse effect, per se. Doubling CO2 by itself only gives you one degree warming. The --"

    "data":"The motion before us, global warming is not a crisis, means we ought to know what crisis means. The word does not mean catastrophe or alarmism. It means a crucial or decisive moment, a turning point, a state of affairs in which a decisive change for better or worse is imminent. We are talking about the future here. The entire world now really does have a critical choice to make. It is whether to continue on the present path of adding more and more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere or whether to find another path. We’re speaking of the future. And science tells us that the path we choose will largely determine what kind of earth our children and grandchildren will inherit. Our task tonight is to persuade you that global warming is indeed a crisis in exactly that precise sense so you should vote against the motion. The science community today has impeccable settled science, despite what you have just heard, that demonstrates the reality of global warming and its primary origin in human activities. We fully understand the fundamental physics behind the greenhouse effect. We also now have persuasive observational evidence of dramatic changes already taking place in the climate system, changes that are not in any sense small. Mankind’s fingerprints have now clearly emerged above the noise of natural variability. That is the primary message of the intergovernmental panel, climate panel, the panel on climate change report that Professor Lindzen referred to – the IPCC. We also have powerful tools to prode…project many aspects of the future climate with considerable confidence. We take into account other important factors besides greenhouse gases – the sun, volcanoes, pollution particles. Some of our forecasts have already come true. A group of people dispute these consensus findings of mainstream scientists. Call them contrarians. Some are here in this very room. Contrarians are not unique to climate. They exist in many fields of science. There are a few retrovirus experts, fully credentialed, who don’t think that HIV causes AIDS. The New Yorker this week, many of you will have seen, writes about them. When the revolution of continental drift was sweeping through geology and geophysics, some imminent earth scientists couldn’t be persuaded that plate tectonics were real. Continents can move. These contrarians were mistaken. They faded from the scene. Experience, long experience shows that in science it tends to be the rare exception rather than the rule when a lone genius eventually prevails over conventional mainstream scientific thought. An occasional Galileo does come along or an Einstein. Not often. Most people who think they’re a Galileo are just wrong. We’re talking here about managing risk for the future. It’s a big risk to the planet to bet it on the contrarians. Here’s a brief look at some of what we know. The IPC said…C said, quote: Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, unquote -- based on many kinds of observations. Also our knowledge of ancient climates tells us that the warmth of the last half century is unusual in at least the previous three…thirteen hundred years. The IPC said…C said, Most of the observed increase in global av…globally averaged temperatures in recent decades is very likely due to the observed increase in human caused greenhouse gas concentrations. These are summary conclusions of, of experts. In a painstaking process, lasting, uh, years with thirty thousand reviewer comments, each log numbered responded to by teams of experts who represent, um, the mainstream science and who take into account views from the fringes as well. There’s never been as thorough and vetted a process for summarizing science precisely for the point of making input to policy makers. Nothing said here tonight in a few minutes that we have can possibly undermine, uh, this powerful statement from the scientific community. We also project a further warming of a half a degree Fahrenheit for the next twenty-five years. Beyond that it does depend largely on how much more CO2 and other greenhouse gases humanity dumps into the atmosphere. Global warming since the nineteenth century is already more than a degree Fahrenheit. It’s continuing. Of the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record, uh, eleven of them have occurred in the most recent twelve years globally. 2006 was the sixth warmest year in this record globally and the warmest year of all in the U.S. Arctic temperatures in the last hundred years increased twice as much as the global average. Since 1950 the number of heat waves globally has increased. The heat wave in Europe in 2003 that killed more than thirty thousand people was unprecedented in modern times. Intense tropical cyclone activity, the IPCC concludes, has increased in the North Atlantic region since about 1970. The global ocean, down to a depth of at least six thousand feet, has been warming since the early 1960s. This warming is contributing to sea level rise. It’s by no means all vestiges of the last Ice Age. Sea level rose some seven inches over the twentieth century. The rate of rise has apparently increased recently. Water vapor in the atmosphere, as predicted, is increasing as the world warms. This additional water feeds back. It’s a greenhouse gas. It amplifies the warming. It’s as though you had your house wired funny so that when it got warm the thermostat turned on the furnace and made it warmer still. Snow cover and mountain glaciers are decreasing markedly. It’s a long list. The list goes on. None of these observational facts is a surprise to the climate science community. They are what we had predicted. We scientists have been expecting measurements like these and now we see them. The question for the future is simply how much worse do we, do we intend? How much more severe, uh, will we let these trends become? The science warns us that continuing to fuel the world using present technology will bring dangerous and possibly surprising climate changes by the end of this century, if not sooner. Business as usual implies more heat waves, higher sea levels, disrupted rainfall patterns, vanishing glaciers and much more. Limiting carbon dioxide amounts to any reasonable level will take large cuts in emissions. It takes time. We have a giant intra… infrastructure based on fossil fuels. To have a meaningful effect by mid-century we need to start soon. The question is really whether humanity has the collective determination to act in any meaningful way. The economic case can be made convincingly, once people understand the cost of doing nothing or too little. It’s like elective surgery. It’s, uh, not free to decline it. Technology can accomplish great things once society is committed to such a goal. We know now that humanity has already increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by thirty-five per cent above natural levels. And humanity, as a group, by default or on purpose, will now decide what level it wants to tolerate. Then, after humanity has made this decision, how much CO2 do you want in your children and grandchildren’s atmosphere?, which –…after that, nature will have its say and the climate system will change in response to the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Nature is superbly indifferent to politics and, and spin. But it will have the last word, uh, in this debate. I have a few seconds and I’ll say a few words about the IPCC. I’ve been a coordinating lead author in it, uh, for three years. I’ve, I was in Paris last month when this summary was negotiated and released. It’s an extraordinarily impressive international collaboration -- thirty thousand review comments, a hundred and fifty, uh, authors – seventy-five per cent of whom, by the way, were new to the process. We’re not a clique defending what we said six years ago. And I urge you to familiarize yourself with the science because the science here has spoken very plainly. Thank you."

    "data":"The microphone goes up. Before I begin I want to just say one brief thing about what Richard has just told you. He’s, he’s giving you the story of plate tectonics but it’s fascinating. He’s turned it upside down. He’s turned it on its head. The story of plate tectonics actually is the story of one person who had the right idea – Alfred Wegener. He had it in 1912. And it is the story of major scientists at Harvard and elsewhere opposing him for decade after decade until finally it was proven to be incorrect what they were believing. So it is, in fact -- when I was a kid I was told the continents didn’t move. It is, in fact, perfectly possible for the consensus of scientists to be wrong and it is, in fact, perfectly possible for small numbers of people to be in opposition and they will be ultimately be proven true. I want to address the issue of crisis in a somewhat different way. Does it really matter if we have a crisis at all? I mean, haven’t we actually raised temperatures so much that we, as stewards of the planet, have to act? These are the questions that friends of mine ask as they are getting on board their private jets to fly to their second and third homes. And I would like, with their permission, to take the question just a little bit more seriously. I myself, uh, just a few years ago, held the kinds of views that I, uh, expect most of you in this room hold. That’s to say, I had a very conventional view about the environment. I thought it was going to hell. I thought human beings were responsible and I thought we had to do something about it. I hadn’t actually looked at any environmental issues in detail but I have that general view. And so in 2000, when I read an article that suggested that the evidence for global warming might not be quite as firm as people said, I immediately dismissed it. Not believe in global warming? That’s ridiculous. How could you have such an idea? Are you going to try and tell me that the planet isn’t getting warmer? I know it’s getting warmer. I grew up in Long Island. And when I was a kid we always had days off from school for hurricanes. There are no hurricanes on Long Island now. I spent thirty years in California. We used to have something called June gloom. Now it’s more like May, June, July, August gloom with September, October, November gloom added in. The weather is very different. However, because I look for trouble, um, I went at a certain point and started looking at the temperature records. And I was very surprised at what I found. The first thing that I discovered, which Dick has already told you, is that the increase in temperatures so far over the last hundred years, is on the order of six-tenths of a degree Celsius, about a degree Fahrenheit. I hadn’t really thought, when we talked about global warming, about how much global warming really was taking place. The second thing I discovered was that everything is a concern about the future and the future is defined by models. The models tell us that human beings are the cause of the warming, that human beings, uh, producing all this CO2, are what’s actually driving the climate warming that we’re seeing now. But I was interested to see that the models, as far as I could tell, were not really reliable. That is to say, that past estimates have proven incorrect. Uh, in 1988, when James Hanson talked to the Congress and said that global warming had finally arrived, The New York Times published a model result that suggested that in the next hundred years there would be twelve degrees Celsius increase. A few years later the increase was estimated to be six degrees, then four degrees. The most recent U.N. estimate is three degrees. Will it continue to go down? I expect so. And this left me in a kind of a funny position. But let me first be clear about exactly what I’m saying. Is the globe warming? Yes. Is the greenhouse effect real? Yes. Is carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, being increased by men? Yes. Would we expect this warming to have an effect? Yes. Do human beings in general effect the climate? Yes. But none of that answers the core question of whether or not carbon dioxide is the contemporary driver for the warming we’re seeing. And as far as I could tell scientists had, had postulated that but they hadn’t demonstrated it. So I’m kinda stranded here. I’ve got half a degree of warming, models that I don’t think are reliable. And what, how am I going to think about the future? I reasoned in this way: if we’re going to have one degree increase, maybe if, if, climate doesn’t change and if, uh, and if there’s no change in technology – but of course, if you don’t imagine there will be a change in technology in the next hundred years you’re a very unusual person. And I also was aware that we have actually been starting to do exactly the kind of thing that we ought to do, which is to decarbonize. Jesse Ausubel at Rockefeller University points out, for example, that starting about a hundred and fifty years ago, in the time of Abraham Lincoln and Queen Victoria, we began to move from wood to coal, from coal to oil, from oil to natural gas and so on. Decreasing our carbon, increasing our hydrogen makes perfect sense, makes environmental sense, makes political sense, makes geopolitical sense. And we’ll continue to do it without any legislation, without any, anything forcing us to do it, as nothing forced us to get off horses. Well, if this is the situation, I suddenly think about my friends, you know, getting on their private jets. And I think, well, you know, maybe they have the right idea. Maybe all that we have to do is mouth a few platitudes, show a good, you know, expression of concern on our faces, buy a Prius, drive it around for a while and give it to the maid, attend a few fundraisers and you’re done.Because, actually, all anybody really wants to do is talk about it. They don’t actually do anything.  And the evidence for that is the number of major leaders in climate who clearly have no intention of changing their lifestyle, reducing their own consumption or getting off private jets themselves. If they’re not willing to do it why should anybody else? Is talking enough? I mean, is, is -- the talking cure of the environment, it didn’t work in psychology. It won’t work in the environment either. Is that enough to do? I don’t think so. I think it’s totally inadequate. Everyday 30,000 people on this planet die of the diseases of poverty. There are, a third of the planet doesn’t have electricity. We have a billion people with no clean water, we have half a billion people going to bed hungry every night. Do we care about this? It seems that we don’t. It seems that we would rather look a hundred years into the future than pay attention to what’s going on now. I think that's unacceptable. I think that’s really a disgrace. This doesn’t need to happen. We’re allowing it to happen. And I don’t know what’s wrong with the rich self-centered societies that we live in in the west that we are not paying attention to the conditions of the wider world. And it does seem to me that if we use arguments about the environment to turn our back on the sick and the dying of our shared world, and that's our excuse to ignore them, then we have done a true and terrible thing. And it’s awful, thank you."

    "data":"Thank you. I want to talk to you a little about the nature of this public debate. And I want to give you some background to what you’ve been hearing so far, and what you’ll hear a little bit later on. The issue of global warming and whether it’s a crisis or not, is in fact a scientific decision, it’s a scientific issue. It’s not a political one. On the other hand, deciding what to do about it is obviously political. Science can inform those decisions, but it can’t determine what decisions society makes. But we’re here to debate the existence of the problem and whether it is a crisis. That's something that the scientists on this side are eminently suited to do. You’ve all seen or heard about the CSI police drama, where high tech forensic scientists try and work out who done it when they come across the scene of a crime. Well think of climate scientists as CSI planet Earth, we’re try-, we see a climate change and we try and work out what’s done it. Just like on CSI we have a range of high tech instruments to give us clues, satellites, ocean probes, radar, a worldwide network of weather stations and sophisticated computer programs to help us make sense of it all. The aim is to come to the most likely explanation of all the facts fully anticipating that in the real world there are always going to be anomalies, there are always going to be uncertainties. Conclusions will be preliminary and always open to revision in the light of new evidence. If this all sounds familiar, it’s because it’s exactly the same approach that doctors take when examining a patient. They don’t know everything about the human body, but they can still make a pretty accurate diagnosis of your illness. We end up then with a hierarchy of knowledge. Some things that are extremely likely, some things we’re pretty sure of, and some things that we think might be true, but really could go either way. There isn’t a division into things that are completely proven and things which are completely unknown. Instead, you have a sliding scale of increasing confidence. Let me give you a few examples. We’re highly confident that the sun is gonna rise tomorrow, it might not, it might go nova. But it’s likely that it will happen. It’s quite likely that you’ll be able to get a cab home from this event, unless it’s raining of course. But, but those two things have different levels of certainty. You’re used to the idea that different kinds of knowledge come with different levels of certainty, and that’s exactly what we’re talking about when we talk about the impacts of climate change. Going back to being climate detectives, we’re certain that carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases and they’ve increased because of human activity. We’re very confident that the planet has been warming up, and we’re pretty sure that the other things that are going on, changes to the sun, changes to particles in the air, changes to ozone have made some difference but aren’t dominant. The physics tells us that this is a very consistent picture. Our suspects, the greenhouse gases, had both the opportunity and the means to cause this climate change and they’re very likely guilty. And they are increasing faster than ever. Now, the lawyers get involved. Lawyers are paid to present a certain case regardless of its merits and they do that by challenging everything in the case, and if one argument doesn’t work, well, they’ll just move on to the next. This procedure works very well when the proposition being debated is very binary, a yes, no. Is the subspe-, is the suspect guilty, uh should he go free, should he go to jail? It is designed specifically to prevent significant action in the face of uncertainty. If there is still reasonable doubt, the suspect gets acquitted even if you still think that they did it. But contrast that with the scientists. They want to know the most likely explanation. The lawyers, they want to win the case. In their own domains both ways of finding out things are very useful, it’s only when they come together in situations like this that things get tricky. Particularly when scientific results are perceived to have economic or moral implications, it’s common for political debates to get shifted into the scientific arena. It makes the political argument seem much more scientific and therefore logical. But since the basic disagreement is still political, this is a disaster for any kind of action. So tonight, you’re not gonna hear us arguing about obscure details in climate science, if you have any questions, I have a web site realclimate.org, you can go and check that out and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you might have. But here we’re gonna talk about the bigger picture. Let me give you a few examples of how that works. Creationists have argued that the eye is too complex to have evolved. Not because they care about the evolution of eyes, but because they see the implications of evolution as somehow damaging to their world view. If you demonstrate the evolution of eyes, their world view won’t change, they’ll just move onto something else. Another example, when CFCs from aerosol cans and air conditioners were found to be depleting the ozone layer, the CEO of DuPont, the main manufacturer argued that because CFCs were heavier than air, they couldn’t possibly get up to the ozone layer. So there was no need to regulate them, that was pure fantasy, but it sounded scientific. Again, tobacco companies spent millions trying to show that nicotine delayed the onset of Alzheimer’s because that was a distraction from the far more solid case that, that linked tobacco to lung cancer. That was a distraction and a red herring. These arguments are examples of pseudo debates, scientific sounding points that are designed not to fool the experts, but to sow confusion and doubt in the minds of the lay public. This is a deliberate strategy and you’re hearing it here tonight. So during this debate, let’s play a little game. I’ll call it spot the fallacy. Every time that you hear the other side claim that we are predicting an imminent catastrophe, give yourself one point. Every time you hear an anecdote used to refute a general trend, that’s cherry picking and we heard that already, uh give yourself another. And every time you hear there’s a lag between carbon dioxide and temperature in the ice cores, give yourself two points because that’s a real doosy. So far this evening we’re running at about two red herrings, two complete errors, three straw men and one cherry pick. So see how you do and we’ll compare notes at the end. Scientists have to be professional skeptics, right, they are trained not to take new information at face value, they have to ask where measurements come from and what they could possibly mean. They have to be dispassionate about the data, and just see where it leads. Once you start making logically fallacious arguments in order to support a predetermined position, you are no longer acting as a scientist, you are acting as a lawyer, however scientific sounding you might seem. Despite that natural skepticism, the national academies of all eight, G8 countries, all the major scientific societies, even the White House have agreed with a scientific consensus on this matter, which pointedly did not happen in the 1970s by the way. Michael Crichton for one has frequently stated the consensus….."

    "data":"Brian may I just take one second to thank very much the Rosenkranz Foundation and Intelligence Squared for having the great courtesy to invite me over from London to participate in this very exciting set of debates. Thank you also to all my colleagues for their contribution and above all to the audience for I’m sure, gonna be exciting participation as well. I want to start exactly with the consensus word that was used by Richard. Can I just remind you he wanted an example. In the early 20th century, 95% of scientists believe in eugenics. Science does not progress by consensus, it progresses by falsification and by what we call paradigm shifts. And in my, riposte I’ll be coming to a paradigm shift that could actually throw the whole of what that other side is saying through the window. But that's later. What I want to come to now is the 1970s that Robert Rosenkranz quite correctly reminded us of. Because then a crisis was announced. And I want to quote from three newspapers. The Christian Science Monitor, Warning, Earth’s climate is changing faster than even experts expect.” I really like that. Your own New York Times, A major cooling of the climate is widely inevitable.” And in Newsweek, back to consensus, Meteorologists are almost unanimous that catastrophic famines will result from global cooling.” That was the 1970s. And there are many headlines. And what I would like to stress is, it was a stress on consensus, it was faster than expected, the evidence came from the oceans, from polar bears, it’s always polar bears, from the changing seasons and it’s always disaster. Why do we believe them now? And what is important in this I think is to remember what that first Earth Day claimed. The first Earth Day in America claimed the following, that because of global cooling, the population of America would have collapsed to 22 million by the year 2000. And of the average calorie intake of the average American would be wait for this, 2,400 calories, would good it were. It’s nonsense and very dangerous. And what we have fundamentally forgotten is simple primary school science. Climate always changes. It is always as Dick said warming or cooling, it’s never stable. And if it were stable it would actually be interesting scientifically because it would be the first time for four and a half billion years. Second, humans have been influencing climate for a million years as hominids, from the first hominid that set fire to the Savanna grasslands in Africa, when particulates and gases started to rise and they changed the reflectivity of the surface of the Earth. It’s a long relationship. So the debate, is climate changing and are humans affecting climate change is actually nearly irrelevant. The answers are yes and yes, and always will be. What is really crucial in all this is something that none of the scientists or none of the politicians want you really to hear. Climate is the most complex system we know governed by thousands of factors, I haven’t time to list them. But the point is, it’s like in my country, Glasgow on a Saturday night, chaos. And what we’re trying to do is manage it by dealing with one pub. One. And it just won’t work, that’s the danger. In such a system, doing something at the margins and not doing something in the margins are equally unpredictable. And the question we should be asking our politicians are, what climate are you actually aiming to produce and when we get there won’t it change anyway? The crisis is therefore in ourselves and if we are rejecting this and I ask you passionately to do so for the next two more important reasons, our uh, political agenda as Michael hinted is wrong. There are two great crises in the world of which the biggest unquestionably is four billion people in poverty. And this topic is an ecocondria of our rich selves, London, New York and Washington. It’s about us and about our hypochondria about the world. If you actually have clean water, you have modern energy, you will cope with change whatever it is, hot, wet, cold or dry. I’m a left wing critic of global warming because the agenda is fundamentally wrong and dangerous. And believe you me, neither Republican nor Democrat will do anything about it, because our second crisis is a crisis of hypocrisy. Now Michael hinted at this, but I come from Europe which has been lecturing the world on this subject. Let me tell you, the hypocrisy in Europe is absolutely mind blowing, I am embarrassed. The latest statistic from the Environment Agency in Europe will predict under the Kyoto Protocol we won’t even be minus, that by 2012, we’ll be plus four percent. And did you know that island whom we all love actually under the Kyoto Protocol is allowed a growth of 13%? And some of the figures for the, for Europe are just spectacularly worrying. Spain, Italy, Portugal, we’re in the 40 percentile. And yet we lecture the world. What we see in this is an enormous danger for politicians in terms of their hypocrisy. I’m not going to say anything about Al Gore and his house. But it is a very serious point. Global warming is also dangerous because I am an environmentalist, but what I’m beginning to see is that global warming is setting age-, agendas which are actually damaging for the environment. Bio fuels in which the energy relationships are very dodgy, but which have a very significant effect certainly in my country on biodiversity. What is more, we’re having wind farms placed for global warming on very, very sensitive peatmoor habitats. Don’t think therefore that if you’re an environmentalist, you have to be attached to this agenda. Because it is now overarching, overdominant and is actually taking money and effort away from genuine and real on the ground habitat …..environmental concerns. But let me end with two images. Angela Merkel the German chancellor, my own good prime minister for whom I voted let me emphasize, arguing in public two weeks ago as to who in Annie get the gun style could produce the best temperature. I could do two degrees C said Angela,” No, I could only do three said Tony.”  Stand back a minute, those are politicians, telling you that they can control climate to a degree Celsius. This is a political crisis, not a crisis as put here, and I ask you passionately to vote against it. And Samuel Johnson and James Thurber, I have to end with Thurber because of the New Yorker. Samuel Johnson, the great lexicographer talked of a, in Russia last talked to an astronomer who thought he could control the sun and the clouds…."

    "data":"I’d like to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation, to all of you for taking time to discuss this urgent topic. Uh, Gavin Schmidt, like in the climate scientists to forensics team of the CSI, uh another metaphor that applies is that of a doctor. And studying global warming is like taking the Earth’s temperature. We’ve seen that it’s rising, and also we have diagnosed the dominant cause of this fever is the heat trapping emissions from human activity. So far temperatures have gone up about over a degree, point, one point four degrees Fahrenheit. That doesn’t mean much to our everyday lives, but it means everything to the Earth. All of us have experienced 100 degree temperature, a hundred and two degree temperature, but we’ve survived. Now the body cannot withstand 107 degree Fahrenheit temperature. That’s about an eight degree jump above the average body temperature. Now when it comes to the Earth, the Earth is much more fragile than the body when it comes to temperature. What we see is that a seven degree increase in global warming would mean that we would accelerate, we would intensify the water cycle, that means the wet places will get wetter and the dry places will get drier. It means we put at risk species that are gonna go extinct. It means that the summer arctic ice is at risk of disappearing. It also means that a seven degree rise in temperature would commit us to substantial sea level rise from melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The Earth’s fever is only getting worse and the animals and the plants that are out there struggling are already giving us the early warning signs. We’ve seen them shift their habitats and we’ve seen them struggle as they cope with the shifting of the period, the warm periods and the cold periods of the seasons. Furthermore, there’s already heat in the pipeline as the oceans play catch-up to the atmosphere loading that we’ve put, these heat trapping gases in our atmosphere. As the oceans warm up, the temperatures will commit us to further warming. We’re locking in another degree of Fahrenheit of warming. That’s heat in the pipeline. Do we really want to lock in even further warming? We’re going to keep studying the symptoms of scie-, as scientists. But the diagnosis is very clear and the course of treatment is even clearer. Choosing not to fight global warming is as foolhardy as ignoring the early warning signs of a fever of a young child and not attending to that. So what is the course of treatment and can we really do something about it? The answer is yes, but we have to act soon, we have to start tackling this problem on all fronts. Our landfills, farms, and livestock are emitting methane and other heat trapping gases. Our fossil fuels, our oil, our coal, our gas, cutting down forests, are committing us to ever increasing levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, in fact, these levels of heat trapping gases are at the highest level than they’ve ever been for hundreds of thousands of years. It’s not natural. Since the dawn of the industrial age, humans have been digging up carbon and putting it on fire, and using it as energy. Now the Earth doesn’t normally set on fire million year ol-, million year old stores of carbon, it’s unnatural. It’s not, it’s not a normal thing. What we’re doing by using these fossil fuels is overwhelming the Earth’s capacity to clean up and absorb that carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The Earth takes hundreds of years to get rid of carbon dioxide and what’s most important, is that this fact is very important to help us decide when we have to start acting about global warming. While some of the worst effects might not be felt for decades or centuries the actions we take today will determine how much carbon dioxide will be in the atmosphere, how much global warming we are locking in, how bad are the effects going to be for ourselves and for our children and grandchildren. That’s what’s really important. We probably have a decade to institute meaningful solutions. Why ten years? That’s because the decisions we make today have a long term commitment. If we do not reform our agriculture practices heat trapping gases will continue to accumulate in the atmosphere. However, if we were to capture methane from our landfills, not only would we stop those emissions from going to the atmosphere, we would also be creating energy at the same time. If we make a building in the old way then we would be polluting for decades to come. However, if we were to build with renewable energy sources new cleaner buildings then that means that we have eliminated that fossil fuel loading of emissions to the atmosphere. If we construct coal power plants the conventional way that means we are substantially increasing the heat trapping emissions in our atmosphere for fifty years and they will linger for many, many more years. However, if we invest in research and technology to capture carbon from those coal plants this will would be welcome news to all the nations of the world that have deep, vast coal reserves. Increasing energy efficiency and harnessing renewable energy from the sun, from the wind, from other sources will help us along this path. If our cities continue to grow, that increase the commuting distance of our citizens, that means we are committing ourselves to burning more fuel. There are better ways. With profitable solutions at hand it’s irresponsible to postpone action. Right now we could put nations on target to reducing emissions. If we start now we reduce each year. However, if we delay that means that the cuts that we have to make to meet our goals will become steeper and steeper and we may not even be able to meet those demands. They will become too hard for us to reach. It’s the equivalent to the person with a credit card who can no longer pay off the minimum payments, that cannot reach their goals. Right now we’re on a spending spree with our heat trapping emissions. We’re building up the future costs of global warming. And – And when this bill comes, uh, when the bill for our emissions today comes, comes due in the not too distant future, um, choosing not to fight global warming is about as irresponsible as not making payments on a high interest credit card. With such high stakes common sense requires that we act now and while we still have options. Um, within the next decade we will continue to determine whether or not our children and grandchildren look back at this time and decide whether we failed them. Or will they look back at this time and see that built a better planet for ourselves and for them? We have a chance to avert this crisis and to assure a safer planet. And if we wait for the children to solve this problem it’s too late. The risks are too big. But before we act on the global warming – we must recognize it for the crisis that it is. Vote no."

    "data":"Thanks, John. And thank you for being here tonight to discuss what I think is one of the most important issues that we have, really, as a nation facing us. You know, Americans are not a group of people that sit out a revolution. If you think about our founding and where we come from, we began with a revolution, the American Revolutionary War. And there have been a few revolutions in our time as well that Americans have not just participated in, but they’ve led. Think about the Industrial Revolution where we established really our ability to be an economic powerhouse. Or, more recently, the information revolution where we reaffirmed in the minds of the world our ability as innovators and creators and inventors, people who really understand the power of technological development. What is this revolution that is upon us now? It is the clean energy revolution. And it’s global. And the question we have before us as Americans is will we lead or will we follow? Will we accept a place on the sidelines, or will we actively participate in moving this issue ahead? Tonight I’m joined by Kassia Yanosek, who’s my partner in this. And you’re going to get to hear Kassia as well, but we stand for the proposition tonight that, in fact, clean energy can drive America’s economic recovery. Energy itself, if you think about the revenues generated globally, the largest industry in terms of revenue generation. So, if we get it right, it absolutely can be a significant part of our economic recovery. And it’s important for us to define the terms to some extent. When people hear clean energy” in a lot of places in the world, they think it’s just wind or just solar. Kassia and I tonight, we’re going to talk about clean energy in this broad spectrum. It is about renewable, about solar and wind and geothermal biomass, but it’s also about all those parts of the spectrum that involve the things that we’re doing to promote clean energy, and the research and development laboratories across this country, both public and private, how you commercialize that technology and get it into the marketplace, those things that involve transmission and Smart Grid technology that help us to manage loads on grid, those parts of the clean energy world that involve transportation -- think electric vehicles or fuel cell vehicles, hybrid cars -- but again, the broad spectrum. When we think about clean energy, we do think about natural gas and believe that natural gas and nuclear and even clean coal can perhaps play a role in building out a clean energy economy in America and that it has to be every part of that, from stem to stern, in terms of our thinking about it. It’s important for us to understand as well that workforce development has to be part of our policy considerations. So one of the reasons I’m here tonight and one of the reasons I was fortunate to be invited is because, as the Colorado governor, I said in Colorado, We’re going to build a new energy economy.” And I said this when I was campaigning, and over a four-year period, I signed 57 different bills into law, bills that we believe made a tremendous difference as it related to our energy portfolio going forward, but particularly relevant to tonight’s topic, made a significant difference in our ability to see economic development attached to clean energy. One of those bills was a renewable energy standard bill in the first 100 days that took us to a 20 percent standard by 2020 with a rate cap in place for consumers. In fact, last year, the utility and I, after talking with each other, said, you know what? We can get to 30 percent by 2020 with the same rate cap in place. So, as a state, we’ve got a 30 percent renewable energy standard. But in those 57 bills, we did Smart metering, meaning people who were residential and industrial consumers could actually get paid if they put energy back onto the grid. We did a variety of things to inspire the bill out of transmission, inspire new technology, energy efficiency. When we talk about clean energy, energy efficiency is one of the most significant things we as a country can do to move this country in a direction toward, in fact, a clean energy economy. So I’m not going to go through the 57 bills, but what I’ll tell you is the proof is in the pudding. We have significant economic development tied to that, and I’ll give you just a couple of examples. Vestas wind turbines, the Danish company, building wind turbines in Colorado, made the announcement just after I made the -- signed the bill. That allowed us to go to a 20 percent by 2020, they in fact then have four factories since that they’ve announced that, at the end of the day, it’s going to be 2,600 employees, a billion dollar investment. SMA, it’s a German company -- they’re manufacturing solar inverters in Colorado for the first time outside of Germany. We have home-grown companies, companies, again, where the technology was developed in a laboratory in Colorado we have, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory or one of our research universities, or even private laboratories. One of the thin-film photovoltaic technologies was developed in a Lockheed Martin laboratory, and so we’ve commercialized that and see these companies grow from the ground up. We’ve seen all sorts of growth in this sector, even during a recession. And it’s not just Colorado. If you look around the country, in places in the Midwest, in the South, in the Southeast, in California, in the Northeast, here in New York, we’ve all sorts of investments in clean energy that is related to job growth. If you look at the last 10 years and if you look at Michigan for example where they've had terrible job loss. In many of their conventional sectors, they’ve seen job increases, a 5.7 percent increase in jobs in Michigan over the last decade. Colorado had an 18 percent increase and as John said we’re the fourth if you look at where we stand, we are fourth in terms of how we have clean tech workers as a state. Now in my last minute I’m just going to tell you there’s a reason for doing this that’s beyond just the economic development. We have a powerful example in Colorado, powerful examples around the country that demonstrate economic development as a part of this. But there’re a couple of other things that are very important too. When you build out a clean energy economy, you actually do something in a very significant way to address the environmental challenges that are upon us. Even if you don’t believe that global warming is human caused there are still significant environmental challenges. They are a part of a carbon based energy production sector. And in addition to that you wind up addressing another very serious problem we have in this country which is energy security. Domestically produced energy does a variety of things including reducing our trade deficit and reducing it in such a way that we can look and say the health of the country is better going forward because we have proposed an agenda that relies upon domestically produced energy. It’s the trifecta, right? It is about energy security, it’s about environmental security, and it’s about economic security. Thank you very much. "

    "data":"Our case against the motion tonight comes in two main parts, first that it represents a brazen case of bait and switch. I thought there’d be two of them, I’ve already heard of the third one, already tonight. And second that it rests on a basic but surprisingly widespread economic fallacy that paying more for energy will somehow make us richer. There are a number of collateral arguments in our case which my partner, Robert Bryce, will explore further, such as the fact that most forms of so-called clean energy are inferior energy sources, ill suited to many of our needs. Now, the bait and switch comes in just two parts, I’ll have to leave the third for later. We’ve been told for the better part of the last two decades that we need to make a rapid transition to clean energy away from fossil fuels in order to stave off climate catastrophe. And all of the official assessments of the matter from the national and international bodies that have studied the matter such as the U.N.’s IPCC concluded that the cost of doing so would be substantial. And the pessimists said the costs that would hurt economic growth and lower GDP. The pessimists said it would hurt a lot, the optimists said the costs would be only modest, but the point is all of the assessments concluded that the sign before the economic cost would be negative. But with the collapse of meaningful climate legislation here and abroad, and the arrival of the great recession, suddenly the argument for clean energy has been shifted into the form of tonight’s motion. Clean energy will make us richer, it is the path to prosperity itself. Happy days are here again. It’s the new domain of free lunch economics, I call it three lumens. Now, the basic problem with so-called clean energy is that nearly every form of it is more expensive than the fossil fuel energy it seeks to displace. Now, I know of no economic theory that says the economy benefits by reducing the purchasing power of consumers. The case for this motion rests on the same fallacy as the retailer who loses money on each sale, but promises to make up for it with additional volume. The second bait and switch concerns what we mean by clean energy, because the working definition of clean energy seems to shift to make the term almost meaningless. Typically clean energy has meant purely renewable sources such as wind, solar, tidal energy and geothermal, along with environmentally neutral technologies like biomass and biofuels, though I could add that corn ethanol badly failed the test of environmental neutrality. And despite more than 30 years of strong emphasis on these sources they still account for less than five percent of our energy supply. But now suddenly we’re told that natural gas is a clean energy source that should be used to displace coal. But there’s something very odd if we’re now counting a fossil fuel, a finite hydrocarbon, as a clean energy source. Do carbon dioxide emissions no longer matter in the definition of clean energy? Consider that climate policy orthodoxy says we need to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions to one billion tons by the year 2050. Today right now, carbon dioxide emissions from current use of natural gas 1.2 billion times. Above the target for every source for the year 2050. This is why the Sierra Club, two weeks ago, changed its position and said we should now make it an object of national policy to phase out natural gas entirely by the year 2050. Their director of climate and energy told the Politico two weeks ago, quote, We want people to know that natural gas is not a clean fuel.” Mark Brownstein, Environmental Defense Fund, told Politico, quote Simply because coal is awful doesn't mean natural gas gets to be terrible.” How is it that natural gas, which, as I say, produces over a billion tons of CO2, is clean energy, but nuclear power, which produces zero CO2 emissions, is usually considered not to be clean energy. Governor Ritter includes it as clean energy. The U.S. Congress specifically excluded it from Climate and Energy legislation the last two years. Moreover, if natural gas is clean energy, then guess what, so is oil. An awful lot of natural gas is produced in the production of oil, and oil has almost the same green house gas emissions per unit of energy produced as natural gas. And if you want to spend enough money, you can make coal clean. Governor Ritter used the same phrase President Obama likes to use: clean coal.” And so you're left with the rest of the clean energy suite that cannot scale up without mandates and massive subsidies from taxpayers. And even then, they still fail. In recent months, you've seen solar power-makers like Solyndra in California, and Evergreen Solar in Massachusetts, lay off a thousand employees, and cut about half their production capacity, despite receiving nearly a billion dollars in loan guarantees and subsidies from government. And we've seen a number of bio-fuel companies fail despite mandates of lavish subsidies. Now, the idea that clean energy will be the sector that leads us out of the recession is equally risible. There are a number of studies on this. I'll give you one quotation from a study from the Stanford University, a very highly-regarded energy modeling forum that concluded, quote, The advantages of increased jobs for renewable energy are vastly overstated at costs prevailing today.” They note that most energy investments produce between two and six jobs. That's true of conventional oil and coal, and natural gas, but also of renewable sources like windmills. Well, of course, if you spend a million dollars on any sector of the economy, the Department of Commerce's models say you get about 9.7 new jobs. That's why the energy modeling forum concluded, quote, Electricity generation across all sources creates far fewer jobs than other activities in the economy. Subsidies to either green or conventional sources will detract, rather than expand economy's job base, because they will shift investments from other sectors that will create warms climates. In other words, if you're looking for a sector to generate job growth, to lead us out of the recession, the energy sector, clean or otherwise, isn't it. Now, I'll conclude with an observation on the essential absurdity of this motion. If this motion were true, we would not need to debate it at all. Did we have to debate whether railroads, and automobiles, and the telegraph, and the telephone, would transform transportation and communication? Did we have to debate whether the technology revolution and the Internet would change our lives?  And change American productivity? Did we, a hundred years ago, have to debate the motion that new oil, coal, and gas supplies will power the next generation of American industry? Of course not. And above all, did we ever need a mandate from the government, like a renewable portfolio standard, to get consumers to buy cars or desktop computers? The answer to that is fairly obvious.  Clean energy, however defined, does not resemble any of the past histories of recession-busting forces. And the odd thing is, most recession-busting forces, like the housing sector in previous recessions, are because of this pent-up demand. There actually isn't a pent-up demand for new energy at the moment. Energy consumption in America has fallen sharply as a result of the recession. Our energy consumption is down by the largest percentage amount since the end of World War II. So building new energy supplies right now makes about as much sense as building new tracts of suburban housing. And by the way, none of the ideas I've heard tonight, with the partial exception of electrified cars such as hybrids, do anything to affect the one part of the energy picture that bothers us the most, and that's our dependence on foreign oil. Most of what you're going to hear tonight is about the electricity sector. We can put a windmill on every single house in America, and put solar panels on every roof, and it will not reduce our oil imports at all. The motion, in my mind, fails badly. "

    "data":"Thank you. Again, my name is Kassia Yanosek and I come to you tonight as an investor. I’ve been an investor in the energy sector for the past decade, and I used to invest in dirty energy. My background includes investing at Bechtel Enterprises, the private equity arm of Bechtel which is a large engineering firm. I also worked at BP. So I started out my career investing in coal and gas. And, you know, as an investor, I look for the biggest growth markets. So that’s why I’m a clean energy investor right now. I don’t sit in an ivory tower or a think tank. Instead, I often sit in airplane seats, travel around the country, roll up my sleeves, meet with energy innovators and entrepreneurs, and I figure out where to create value in this economy, which is why we’re here tonight. And this is what we’re talking about tonight. You know, most recently, before starting my firm, I was a senior member of a billion dollar private equity firm that’s deployed millions of capital in the sector of clean energy. I currently invest with New York investment houses around the subject of innovation and clean energy technologies, and that’s where I think the opportunities are in this market. So I’m going to give you the real story tonight about why clean energy will drive our economic recovery. The other thing I’d like to point out is that I actually don’t think we should be having this debate -- not will it or won’t it drive economic prosperity but how it can drive our economy. We need to start competing and get out from behind our computers where we write op-eds, stop resting on our laurels of the past, stop wimping out about how China is going to cream us. Is that any way to win a match or a race? So my goal tonight is to convince us that we can continue to be an innovation leader in other sectors that we’ve done in the past, and that clean energy is the next growth market for the U.S. And here’s why clean energy can drive economic growth. I’m going to give you three reasons. First of all, innovation in new industries drives job creation and investment, and I’m going to provide some examples, from I.T. to the auto industry, and also why government has in the past, and it needs to continue to be, an integral part of this growth for the energy sector. Number two, clean energy will drive exports which are critical to our future growth. So, instead of complaining about China, let’s start competing so we can sell into China. And then, third, we do need to talk about our dependence on oil. Oil does not help economic recovery. Our dependence on oil doesn’t help economic recovery; it actually hinders economic recovery. So we actually need a broad menu of energy options to reduce our dependence on any one commodity, which smoothes out volatility and helps our economy grow. So, point number one: innovation drives job creation and lower costs in our energy sector. You know, we can see this in our I.T. markets. We now lead the world in research, product, and deployment. And certainly, Silicon Valley has been a huge driving force of the U.S. economy. Right now, I believe that about 16 percent of our total exports are related to advanced technologies. Well, guess what? That wasn’t part of our economy 30 to 40 years ago, so clean energy has a great future ahead of it if we’re going to actually put our heads together and start innovating. And government was a big part of that. DARPA which is an arm of the government was instrumental in the development of the Internet. And secondly, the auto industry -- dinosaur industry. You know, we got our pants beat off by Japan. But guess what? Detroit is turning around. We’re starting to see Ford and Chevrolet start developing electric vehicles. There’s a lot of activity out there, and it’s winning accolades. So it really debunks this view that we can’t afford to have this job creation in the United States. And then, finally, without going too much into the weeds, I’ll point out some obvious statistics about how clean energy is driving investment in jobs. Last year, $243 billion was invested in clean energy globally. This is essentially a 25 percent compound average growth rate that we’ve seen over the past five years. And this is really one of the biggest drivers that we’re seeing in the markets today. In the past 10 years clean jobs grew 9.1 percent in the United States while total jobs grew by only 3.7 percent. So I have a little bit of different perspective and some different statistics than my opponents over there. And then, finally, I’ll point out that costs are coming down, count down the curve. Electric batteries cost about $1,000 a kilowatt hour two years ago; today it’s about half that, and we’re on track for some very competitive technology that we’re going to see in our electric vehicles within the next 10 years. So we’re starting to see a real big steepness in the innovation curve. Point two, clean energy will drive exports which are critical to our future growth. It’s important that we grow a domestic market not only for us but for our export markets. It’s an opportunity worth trillions of dollars and millions of jobs. My opponent actually pointed out a very important point: There is not a whole lot of energy growth going on in the U.S. and in the next 10-20 years. Ninety percent of the growth and energy consumption over the next two decades is going to come from developing countries. So we better get on that so we can actually benefit from the growth that we’re going to see in these export markets. So, finally, we need to learn from the information technology industry. We need to develop the energy economy the way we did the I.T. And we’re starting to do that. Clean tech really is where information technology was 30 years ago and where biotech was 20 years ago. So we’re at the beginning of a very long and prosperous future for this sector. And then, point three, we need a portfolio of energy choice. Dependence on fossil fuels doesn’t help economic recovery. As I said, it actually hinders it. You know, we’re seeing $100 oil. We’ve seen this happen before, and price spikes really do not help the economy. Rising energy prices act as a drag on GDP growth. A 10 percent oil shock is -- could actually lower GDP growth by .2 percent per year for the next two years, and that’s a recent statistic that Goldman Sachs just put out. We’re also seeing that high oil prices can increase inflation which compresses corporate margins, impacts the consumers, so when we talk about the price of energy, I don’t necessarily see that the current state of affairs in fossil fuel is helping the energy economy in keeping costs down for consumers. So, essentially, with that, I’m going to close with bringing you back to the focus of this debate, which is that clean energy can drive the future of our economy. And, frankly, if you’re not for the clean energy economy, then you’re not for economic recovery. Thank you. "

    "data":"So, please, by a show of hands, who here is in favor of dirty energy? Well, the fact is that clean energy sounds tremendously appealing. There is no question about it. And debunking clean energy is a dirty job, but Steve and I are here to do just that. Reality is that clean energy is not a specific thing; it is a marketing slogan. If you remember, the Waxman-Markey Bill in 2009 was called the American Clean Energy and Security Act. To the specifics, Governor Ritter mentioned natural gas. I am as pro-natural gas as anyone. I’m also ardently pro-nuclear. N to N, natural gas to nuclear -- I believe these are the paths to the future for a number of reasons. But he also included in his statement that coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar are clean. The reality is if all of our energy sources are clean, then none of them are. Regarding clean coal, I view that oxymoronic, akin to family vacation or jumbo shrimp. Took a while, but I’m glad you finally got it. Thank you. Wind energy is often viewed as the political darling of the moment. This is the clean energy source of the future. Well, if you saw WGBH just yesterday they had a story about Falmouth, Massachusetts, in which they talked about the objections and, in fact, the strenuous protest by local residents against a new wind turbine in that town. I can point you to localities all over the world. I have interviewed people in New Zealand, Australia, Ontario, Nova Scotia, Missouri, Wisconsin, New York, some very heated debates here in New York State over the sighting of industrial wind turbines. What is the problem? Infrasound, low level noise that is driving people out of their homes. The wind energy industry says, Oh, well, these people that are complaining just need psychological counseling. I kid you not. This is a serious problem that they cannot solve and they try to dismiss it out of hand, it cannot be resolved. My opponent said that natural gas or rather that fossil fuels can’t possibly lead to any kind of economic recovery, I completely disagree. Natural gas today is selling for less than $4, why? Because of a tremendous technological innovation in the upstream oil and gas business. It's selling for about $4 per million BTUs, that’s a reduction of about $3 per MMBTU compared to just three years ago. That reduction in price is one of the rare bright spots in the commodity markets in the U.S. It is now saving American consumers $65 billion per year or $180 million per day, and that’s a minimum number. The reality is clean energy is such a nebulous phrase it cannot possibly be supported because the phrase doesn’t mean anything, therefore, you must vote against. Second point, green jobs do not exist or are so expensive as to be crippling to the economy. If you’d believe the corn ethanol scammers, one of the longest running robberies of taxpayers in this country’s history, they just put out a report last month that said they’re -- they support 70,000 jobs. Well, if you believe the Congressional Budget Office numbers, the total taxpayer cost of the corn ethanol scam is over $16 billion. That works out to $230,000 per job. What about the wind industry? We hear this continually from the American Wind -- Energy Association, Oh, we’re creating all kinds of manufacturing jobs, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Texas Comptroller Public Accounts Susan Colmes just came out with a report in December, estimated that every wind job in Texas, where I live, Texas leads the country in new -- in wind generation capacity, 10,000 megawatts, each job associated with the wind industry costs $1.6 million to the taxpayers. Third point, clean energy cannot possibly drive America’s economic recovery because it is simply too small in scale. I pride myself on doing my research, doing my numbers, here they are. Every day coal provides about 10 million barrels of oil equivalent to the U.S. economy. Natural gas provides about 12 million barrels of oil equivalent every day to the U.S. economy. We also use roughly 17 million barrels of oil. So roughly 39 million barrels of oil equivalent from those three hydrocarbons, that dirty, nasty energy that nobody likes but everybody uses. Okay, so what about the political darlings of the moment, the clean energy sources that we’ve been discussing here? Non-hydro sources because we can’t build any more dams here, geothermal, wind, biomass, and solar. In 2010, according to the EIA they provided 166 million megawatt hours of electricity to the U.S. That works out to277,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. So how does that compare then? If we just look at the two dirty, nasty sources of energy, oil and coal, they provide 100 times as much energy to the U.S. economy as the political darlings of the moment, the clean energy darlings of the moment. And if we include natural gas, which I believe is clean incredibly pro-natural gas, the ratio is 140 times as much energy from the three hydrocarbons as we get from the clean energy sources. We could double, triple, quadruple, quintuple the amount of energy that we’re getting from the clean energy sources that we’re discussing here, it will be so small as to make no difference to the U.S. economy, and it certainly will not drive America’s economic recovery, therefore, you must vote against the motion. Final point, clean energy cannot fuel America’s economic recovery because it is simply too expensive. Latest data from the Energy Information Administration estimate that over the next five years or so, gas fired electricity will cost about $63 per megawatt hour, onshore wind will cost about 50 percent more than that, offshore wind, four times as much as that, and solar thermal generated electricity, five times as much as that. In January, The Los Angeles Times reported on the city of Los Angeles' goal of having 33 percent of its electricity coming from renewables by 2020. I quote from The Times, that, this push for renewables could result in electricity rate hikes of five to eight percent in each of the next five years.” What's happening now, the city of Los Angeles is quietly rolling back the renewable targets. In the governor's, Governor Ritter's home state, electricity rates have increased by 21 percent over the past six years, and the Denver Post just reported they are likely to increase by 20 percent over the next six. Over the last six years, the increase has been twice the rate of inflation. The reality is that oil price spikes hurt the U.S. economy, there's no question about that. With the coming rate, electricity rate hikes that will come from these renewable portfolio standards in the electricity markets, will be even worse for the economic recovery. You must vote against the motion. Thank you. "

    "data":"I’ll speak for the motion that “Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money.” Perhaps a natural reaction to that would be, what, are there still people who think it’s more important to save money, than to save the world? That’s not our point. Our point is, that we should really save the world, not just feel like we’re saving it. Let’s be clear—global warming is real. Man-made, and increases by carbon emissions. And global warming will harm future generations, especially the world’s poor. But the brutal fact is, that even major carbon cuts at dramatic cost will make little impact on temperature, and do virtually nothing to help the world. Still, my honored opponents will spend hundreds or even thousands of billions of dollars, to slightly reduce the impact of climate change 100 years from now, yet more than half the world’s population suffers from Medieval problems that we could fix right now, at much lower cost. This is nothing less than a moral tragedy for the developed world. Knowingly squandering colossal sums of money, achieving almost nothing, while fractional sums could save millions of lives right now. Obvious as it may sound, our goal isn’t for those of us in wealthy western world to feel good about ourselves, presumably, it’s about making sure we do the most good. Today, 1 billion lack clean drinking water, 2 billion people lack sanitation, 3 billion people lack simple micronutrients, preventing physical and mental development. One quarter of all the world’s deaths, are due to easily curable infectious diseases. The equivalent of the population of Florida, wiped off the map, each year. As an example, 1 million people die from malaria each year, and up to 2 billion people get the debilitating disease. Yet, my esteemed opponents will focus on how global warming will cause a slight increase in malaria increase 100 years from now, and suggest that we should fix that through inefficient carbon cuts. But we could eradicate malaria right now, if we wanted, and at a lot lower cost. That is the moral choice. This pattern of little good at high cost, we find repeated in the cases by opponents will present to you. And this is why all peer-reviewed economic valises show that simply cutting carbon is a poor way to help the world. And that’s exactly the crux of tonight’s debate. That the best available economic evidence tells us that by focusing on cutting carbon emissions, we’re committing to an exceptionally inefficient way to tackle the symptoms of global warming, let alone global warming itself. And given how much of our resources will be squandered in the process, the consequences are nothing less than a moral tragedy. Of course, my esteemed opponents will claim that without major carbon cuts, the world will be beyond saving. Oliver Tickell has written that unabated global warming by the end of the century will be a catastrophe, and the beginning of the extinction of the human race because all the ice will melt and we’ll see 200 feet of sea-level rise in the long term, wiping out pretty much everyone we hold dear, killing billions of people. This doom-mongering is simply wrong. It’s inconsistent with everything we know. And it’s important that people everywhere start to realize this. We’ve entrusted the UN Climate Panel, the so-called IPCC, with its thousands of scientists, to outline the most likely climate consequences. They do not support Tickell, or any of the other, more alarmist writings of recent times. What the IPCC does tell us is, yes, sea levels will rise, somewhere between six and 24 inches over the coming century. Such a rise is entirely manageable, and not dissimilar to the about 12 inches we barely noticed, have risen over the last 150 years. Dramatic, expensive carbon cuts would make sea-level rise just a few inches less in 100 years. Is this really the best we can do to help the world? Of course, the obvious and easy thing to say is, well, we should do all good things, we should both make major carbon reductions, and combat malaria. But this simply ignores the fact that we aren’t doing either very well. We avoid the hard truth that the rich world’s focus is shifting daily towards global warming, with proportional less support seen for the real, and more tractable problems. It’s simply untruthful to claim that the focus on climate change doesn’t mean there’s less money going elsewhere. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, is telling us that billions of dollars are being redirected to the fight, global warming, at the expense of the biggest killers of the poor countries. Any company or organization today that wants to be responsible, even just cool, will not be spending their cash on fighting tuberculosis, but wants to go carbon-neutral. We must save the world, yes. And here’s how. At The Copenhagen Consensus Project last year, a panel of the world’s most distinguished economists looked at a wealth of research of all the major problems in the world, and the possible solutions to them. And they showed us where we can do the most good. They agreed that global warming’s real, and they were unanimous that the best way to tackle it is by investing much more in research and development in low carbon energy technologies. The economists also found that carbon emission cuts, tonight’s motion, would be the poorest use of our money. They confirmed that we can do so much more good elsewhere, that we need to ease our preoccupation with cutting carbon, and focusing much more on fixing the real problems of the here and now. This is about saving everyone’s world. Not through ineffective and hugely costly carbon cuts, but through effective research and development, and low carbon energy sources, that anyway, will be the only long-term solution to the CO2 problem. And then remembering the major problems and challenges of this world. Every single year and right now, a devastation is taking place in our world. A dumb, readily avoidable devastation. Continuing mindlessly, and spending hundreds of billions of dollars in carbon cuts, is simply disgraceful, when it takes so little to do something about this devastation. So, this is our chance. Our chance not just to feel good about helping the planet, but actually to do the right thing, the rational thing, and the morally correct thing. I commend this motion to you, do what’s rational, not just what’s fashionable. Thank you."

    "data":"I would prefer not to see this as any kind of feud, I think it’s a debate and it’s a debate which I’m very pleased to be able to pursue here, with all of you. Bjorn did an excellent presentation, and he made very effective use of the particular rhetorical flourish which I would call the false choice, or the false dichotomy. Either we address the problem of global warming, or we address the problems of malaria, water provision, and malnutrition. But this is a false choice, no one’s saying that we’ve got to do one or other, we can do both. It is no more real a choice than that between tackling global warming and eating pizza. You know, we can do both. In fact, if we tackle the problems of global warming in an effective way, it will directly help with the provision of water. One of the major problems of global warming is the loss of rainfall, shifting patterns of rainfall, melting of glaciers that feed hundreds of millions of people worldwide. So, failing to deal with global warming is a huge step back on that fight, likewise with malaria, and other insect-borne disease, as temperatures rise, so these diseases will spread and become more prevalent, and hold back development further. Now. The core point though, Bjorn very kindly began to make it for me. It is that the consequences of not dealing with global warming are potentially catastrophic. And, he said this is inconsistent with everything we know. Well, that’s wrong. What we do know, is that 55 million years ago, at a time called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, temperatures were ten degrees warmer than they are now. Carbon dioxide levels were approximately one thousand parts a million -- very high levels. And sea levels were approximately two hundred and fifty feet higher. Now, we have been there before. We can go there again. There is no law that says that we cannot revert to that state of fifty-five million years ago. There is no certainty that that will happen. It might happen or it might not. Climate is extremely complex. There are many, many feedbacks of frankly, breathtaking intricacy and complexity, which we haven’t even begun to fathom. And for that reason, I find Bjorn’s certainty that this will not take place completely incomprehensible. There is no certainty in this. The only certainty is once it’s already happened. And given those uncertainties, our overwhelming priority must be to make sure that it does not happen. It is hard even to put a probability on it, but the facts are that climate, the climate system is characterized by feedbacks, including some very powerful positive feedbacks, even with the one degree. In fact, under one degree of temperature rise that we’ve had so far, these feedbacks are kicking into effect. These include the melting of arctic sea ice which causes the sun’s rays to be absorbed, raising temperatures at the poles. It includes the reduced absorption of carbon dioxide into oceans. There were results in the newspaper yesterday from the Sea of Japan where the absorption of carbon dioxide is halved. We see that the forests of Canada, which had been considered a major net carbon sink, are now becoming a net source of carbon as a result of insect depredations caused by higher temperatures. So, positive feedback process are already taking place as temperatures continue to rise further. Further positive feedbacks can swing into effect and we could indeed find ourselves propelled through the uncontrolled emissions of methane, from example, from peat bogs and swamps. We could find that we well and truly lose control of climate, that positive feedbacks take over from everything that we are doing ourselves. And that is where we must not go. And yes, there are costs. To avoid this you have to spend money. But there are many other cases in which we spend money to avoid potentially catastrophic risks, even if we perceive those risks as being improbable – such as insurance against a car crash or a house fire, where the costs are potentially huge, even if the probability is low. In this particular case, of course, we have to be mindful of the cost. We don’t just want to throw unlimited amounts of money at this problem. But if we look at the amounts of money, I mean, my cost – and which includes not only mitigation but also substantial funding for adaptation, which is already taking place– is about one trillion dollars per year. And that is, roughly the same as what the world spends on weaponry and the military sector. So if we can afford to spend that on weapons, why can’t we afford to spend it to prevent this potentially ruinous catastrophe that could come upon us. But I will go a stage further. I will say that much of this isn’t really cost at all. It is investment. Because we need ultimately to move away from fossil fuels anyway. If we move away from fossil fuels sooner, before we have to – because they run out – that actually saves enormous economic cost. It saves the economic cost of a hundred and fifty dollar a barrel petrol, oil. And that is something that has caused America and other countries huge hardships. We can create new industries. We have huge idle work forces. We have huge idle productive capacity in industries that can be put back to work building us a future free of fossil fuels. The world at the moment is ravaged by conflict, much of that conflict over access to fossil fuels. If we move to a fossil fuel-free future, then much of that expenditure will vanish. But not only that expenditure, but all of the suffering, all of the tragedy that is associated with it. So in answer to the question, the motion, Is it worth the money to make these  in carbon dioxide emissions?, the only possible answer is, Yes, and do it now."

    "data":"Well, while he was running, Barack Obama was heard to say that he would bankrupt our coal industry. Now, I don’t doubt Washington’s ability to bankrupt almost anything in the United States. But, but China is currently adding a hundred gigs of coal electricity a year. That’s one entire United States worth of coal consumption every three years. There is no end in sight and there are other countries, all across the globe, following exactly in its footsteps. So let me say here quickly, where I end up and then try and tell you how I get there. We rich people of the planet can’t stop the other five billion poor people from burning a couple of trillion tons of carbon that they have within easy reach. We can’t even make any real dent in global emissions because the emissions are growing too fast, they involve too much involvement by very poor people who can’t easily change their ways and because those poor people are part of the same global economy as us.And if we are foolish enough, which we could well be, we will let carbon worries send our jobs to their shores and they will grow even faster and carbon emissions will grow faster still. It should go without saying, we don’t control global supply of carbon. Ten countries ruled by thoroughly nasty people control eighty per cent of the world’s oil, a trillion barrels currently worth fifty trillion dollars at current market prices. Now, if I told you that there was that value in gold where it actually is, where the oil actually is, you would scoff at any suggestion that anything we could do, no matter what we spent, could force those people to keep that oil in the ground. It’s all they’ve got. They will drill it. They will pump it. They will find a market and somebody will burn it. Poor countries all around this planet are sitting on a trillion tons of readily accessible coal. It’s all they’ve got for energy beyond the other great carbon reservoir of the planet, which is the rain forests and the soils, which they also, by and large, control. They will squeeze the carbon they can out of cheap coal, cheap forests and cheap soil, because that’s what’s there, unless they can get something even cheaper than that. And that, as I shall discuss shortly, is going to take some doing. We no longer control demand for carbon, either. The five billion poor people are already the main problem – not us. If you have heard otherwise, you have heard wrong. Collectively, the poor already emit twenty per cent more greenhouse gas than we do. We burn a lot more carbon individually, of course, but they have a lot more children. Their fecundity has beaten out our gluttony and the gap is now widening very fast. China, not the United States, is now the largest emitter of greenhouse gas on the planet and it will soon be joined by others. It’s only a matter of time. And finally, the poor countries have made perfectly clear that they are not interested at all in spending what a low carb diet would cost. They have more pressing problems. So it really does come down to this. First, can we give the world something cheaper than carbon? The moon shot law of economics says, Why, yes, we can. If we just really put our minds to it, it will happen -- atom bomb, moon landing, energy, you name it. No, not this time. Fossil fuels are very cheap because they concentrate a lot of energy in a small space. You find a mountain of coal and you can just shovel gargantuan amounts of energy into the boxcars. Renewable fuels like sun and wind are much harder. Windmills are now fifty story skyscrapers, yet one windmill generates a piddling two megawatts. A jumbo needs a hundred megawatts to get off the ground. Google is building hundred megawatt servers just to move bits around. Meeting New York City’s total energy demand would require something like thirteen thousand windmills spinning at full speed or more like fifty thousand windmills scattered all over the state because you’ve gotta have enough of them to be sure enough of them are in the windy spots. What was your Mayor thinking when he suggested that you might just tuck them into Manhattan? I mean, that kind of thinking betrays a very common view that, In fact, it betrays a profound ignorance about how difficult it is to get huge amounts of energy out of these very dilute, thin forms of fuel, like sun and wind. Renewable technologies are not moving down the same plummeting cost curves that we’ve seen in our laptops and our cell phones. When you replace conventional with renewable everything gets bigger, not smaller – much, much bigger – and costs get higher, not lower. China and India won’t trade three cent coal for fifteen cent wind or thirty cent solar. And if we force those expensive technologies on ourselves, we will certainly end up doing more harm than good. Twenty percent of the planet buys much less carbon, the other eighty percent will be delighted to buy at a lower price. The real jobs will go where the energy is cheap, just as they go where the labor is cheap because manufacturing and heavy industry require so much energy. And in a global economy you can’t possibly compete if you’re paying two or three times as much as your competitors for an essential input. Green jobs means Americans paying other Americans to chase carbon while the rest of the world builds power plants and factories. But the rest of the world is less efficient than us and less careful. A massive transfer of carbon and industry and jobs from us to them will raise carbon emissions. It will not lower them. So, unless we are going to ask the Pentagon to take charge – and good luck with that -- we don’t have the power to deliver any lasting reduction in global carbon emissions at all. Whatever we might achieve in the very short term at home, we can’t control the global supply of carbon. We can’t control the five billion poor people who desperately want to burn it and who already control more of the demand than we do. And we can’t control the flight of jobs and industry to where the industry is cheap. Frantically chasing the impossible and falling flat on your face doesn’t make things better. It often makes things worse and it’s never worth the money."

    "data":"Major carbon reductions are worth the money. Mr. Huber, I want to thank you for your novel argument, summed as, No, we can’t. You begin by saying you care about the world’s poor and then you start by saying, “The five billion poor people are the problem.” We’re going to send our jobs to their shores. They have too many children. This type of contempt will not lead us towards the world that we want to build for our kids, either here or across the world. The question at hand, and the question we face, is, Are major reductions in carbon worth the money? And I’ll very simply give examples at the level of the economy, at the level of a corporation and the level of the individual. Not is it all investments, every investment – it’s, Are major reductions worth the money? Mr. Huber, I read that you wrote about enhancing America’s electric power grid. That’s a great way of having great reductions in carbon in a way that’s very much worth the money. We waste about six to ten percent of all energy through America’s very inefficient electricity grid. If we invested in a smart grid it could save up to twenty billion dollars a year that’s lost through line loss. Major carbon reductions can be worth the money. Americans spend about a week a year, if they commute a lot, stuck in their cars. That costs the economy in terms of productivity and fuel costs about $78 billion a year. If we invested in new traffic software and signaling, public transportation to create those green jobs that you have such contempt for, um, we could in fact reduce that, greatly. Major carbon reductions are worth the money. At the level of a corporation, more and more corporations are not just doing it because it’s fashionable, they’re doing it because they’re building a strategy for sustainability to move them forward. I’ll give you a few examples. Xerox, that iconic American company, around the year 2000 was on the verge of bankruptcy, was, was at its knees, and the vultures were circling. And Ann Mulcahy, the CEO, when she took over she committed that by 2012 they would reduce their carbon output by 10 percent between 2002 and 2012, and they started investing in remanufacturing, and today 91 percent of all the parts in Xerox machines are remanufactured or recycled, which means you don’t need to get new stuff from the earth and much better from a carbon emissions standpoint. Well by the year 2006, they reached that 2012 goal, they reached their 10 percent reduction and they actually committed to a 25 percent reduction, by the year 2012. Today, in 2009, they’re at about 21 percent and they’re well on their way. There’s a company that’s more productive, that’s making more money for its shareholders, because of strict carbon restrictions. Sun Microsystems has about half of its workers telecommuting. This saves the worker a few hundred dollars, up to $1000 because they don’t have to commute anymore, and it saves the company money. Last year about $68 million in avoided costs because they didn’t have offices for all those people. People get to be more productive, they get to work in their pajamas, it’s a win-win all over the place, major reductions in their carbon use, about 30,000 metric tons saved by that, are good and worth the money. Finally a company that I do work with, Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart made three commitments in its turn-around, one, to be powered 100 percent by renewable energy which would be a major reduction in carbon. Two, to produce zero waste, which would reduce their carbon emissions. And three, to only sell green products in their stores. Major commitments by a major manufacturer. They’ve pushed this down the supply chain, it pulled energy out, lowering the cost of the products, lowering the cost to the consumer. And one of the reasons a company like Wal-Mart is doing so well right now is that they’ve become more efficient, because of a focus on major reductions in carbon. And, one of the associates I was able to work with at Wal-Mart is named Chuck Bonnett, I want to give you as an example—at an individual level, how major reductions can actually make sense. Chuck works the meat counter at Wal-Mart, and he made a personal sustainability practice commitment, to reduce the amount of carbon emissions that he had personally. A major reduction in his personal life, in carbon emissions. And he tried to figure out what to do and he was actually in line at a fast food restaurant. And as he was in this line waiting for his burger, he watched all the cars idling and thought, oh, that’s carbon. And he thought about the hamburger which had been, been frozen and shipped across, maybe across the country, perhaps across the world, and he thought about the carbon that came from the cow and the thought about the plastic that was wrapping this hamburger. And he thought you know if I cut that out, it’s not gonna only be good for my health, and he had to lose about 100 pounds, maybe I can get a discount on my health care, and actually, maybe I can save some money ‘cause I’ll cook meals at home rather than going out so much which a lot of people across the world are doing, who have the opportunity to eat out. In this case, major reductions in his own personal carbon emissions, were worth the money. Now… our opponents tend to focus on the fact that we can’t do everything. And that there are other problems and, yes, there are other problems and we need to work on them. For example, I could tell you tonight, that there are exit signs at the back of the theater and, there’s one at the side of theater and that’s probably very important in case there were a fire, but, maybe I could instead tell you about influenza, because that’s the eighth-largest killer in America and I might tell you worry about the person next to you, ‘cause they might be a little sickly. And you might need to worry about them, or maybe I could check your purses, or check your dinner reservation for later tonight because maybe, you’ll decide to go out and have a dessert or a creamy special appetizer. Because you know that heart disease is the greatest killer in America. These things are all true, but we can do two things at once, we can walk and chew gum at the same time. And the great thing about carbon, is that it’s one single thread, if you pull it, the entire sweater begins to unravel. It’s one single step that can help people save money and live better lives at their individual level, at a corporate level, and even at an economy-wide level. Major reductions in carbon are good for the economy, and are absolutely worth the money. Thank you."

Very sadly, I have to quote Samuel Johnson, the great British lexicographer. “An obstinate stubbornness, a rationality, stops me believing it.” And with a twinkle in my eye, because we’re in New York and near Wall Street, what I want to show, very dangerously, is that, climate science and these costs are sub-prime science…sub-prime economics, and above all, sub-prime politics.

In fact, Johnson again had a wonderful phrase for it. “Let’s not be befuddled, by the clamor of the times.” Let me therefore start, by science, I’m not going to say much on science because, I agree with what Robert said, right at the start in this. It’s actually not very much about the science, it’s always been about economic and political choice. Everything is when it comes down to it, like it or not. But I just want you to have one image, and it’s a very serious scientific image, I want you to think of the world…I want you to think of the world from inner Siberia, to Greenland, then to Singapore, and then come to the Arab states and to Sahara. What, ladies and gentlemen, is the temperature range I have just covered. It is from minus 20 degrees C, to nearly 50 degrees C, a range of 70 degrees C, in which humanity has adapted and learnt to live. We are talking about, ignoring the extremes that Oliver said, a prediction of 2 to 3 degrees C, what a funk! I’m very serious, what a funk! Humanity lives successfully from Greenland to Singapore to Saudi Arabia. 70 degrees C. And what is more, the carbon reductions will not produce an outcome that is predictable. Climate is the most complex, coupled, nonlinear, chaotic system known to man. Of course there are human influences in it, nobody denies that. But what outcome will they get, by fiddling with one variable at the margins. I’m sorry, it’s scientific nonsense. And a very serious nonsense. But it’s the economics above all, because that’s the motion, the costs. I come from the left wing politically. I am fed up with environmentalists putting regressive costs and taxes on the poor. It always costs more in the end, whatever Adam and the other say, and it’s always fundamentally on the poor. They’ve forgotten the famous Jevons Paradox, Professor Jevons from my own country, University College, London, that actually when you save on energy, you don’t really save, you simply transfer it to new energy costs, and actually probably issue more CO2. So when you save energy you take another holiday, you take another flight, your CO2 increases. And he demonstrated that in the 19th century. Have we forgotten this basic economics. But above all, it’s this. I’m going to be honest about this, I don’t trust the environmentalist agenda. For 30 to 40 years, what they have fundamentally been wanting to do, is place an infinity in cost-benefit. In other words, so that the rationality of economic choices is undermined by effectively a religious choice, not an economic choice. Under an infinity of course, choice is not made under the procedures that were put down by Peter, and by Bjorn. But it won’t work. And that leads me, it becomes a closed system of thought, and that always worries me deeply. But it’s the politics then, finally, sub-prime politics. We are full of eco-poseurs and in the United States you have some gems. I don’t think I need to mention them. But what we’ve got to remember is that, this motion is about the cost of artificially in a sense, forcing down the carbon. Energy security, efficiency, are of course they’re absolutely vital. Energy security will become of the major themes…of the Obama administration, and rightly so, but that isn’t artificially forcing down carbon. And exactly as Peter said, only this week, China announced a 30 percent increase by 2015, in its coal production. Actually announced that only this week. And in a sense, we are not being realistic. As I said I would love to be able to think we can control climate, when of course it is indeed going to have to be adaptation, flexibility put to an outcome that we don’t know ‘cause I actually don’t know what climate, they’re wanting to produce for us. And actually I don’t think they know either. But let me come back to Johnson again, ‘cause Johnson said everything—Bible, Shakespeare and Johnson, you’ve got it. And Johnson said virtually everything. In a very, very brilliant book that he wrote in the 18th century there called Rasselas, he talks of an astronomer who claims that he can control climate. This is what he says. “The sun has listened to my dictates, and passed from tropic to tropic by my direction. The clouds at my call, have poured their waters.” And what does Johnson say about this astronomer—astronomer? He was mad! And so are we, if we actually believe we can control climate predictably, the costs in every sense will be enormous. Oh, mamma mia. We are the dancing queens. Let’s give this global warming nonsense, its Waterloo tonight. Thank you."

    "data":"Wow. Philip, you ought to be a preacher. You ever heard a more religious proposition? Let’s bring it back to economics, I’m a professor of business at Presidio School of Management, and I teach my students to follow the money. Are major reductions in carbon worth the money. That’s what we’re debating, we’re not debating whether or not we can control the climate, we’re not even debating what the climate will be, we’re debating, are major reductions worth the money, and that’s the only question…for better or worse that we’re gonna talk about tonight. My company walked into a company that has big warehouses, about a million square feet of warehouse, and boxes stacked floor to ceiling. Every 10 feet in the ceiling were 500-watt light bulbs shining down on the tops of boxes. The guys who worked down below had task-lighting so they could see where they were going. We said, y’all have a switch? $650,000 saved the first year, now that is not a cost, to deliver major carbon reductions. Similarly we worked with another company that has left its… 630,000 computers and monitors on 24-7 because they had an urban myth that you, uh, have to leave your computers on. And we pointed out to them that, actually, IT did not need them left on 24-7. And a simple company policy that when you turn your computer off you turn it all the way off, saved them $700,000 the first year. Again, zero cost, now this is what’s called low-hanging fruit, we could half the carbon in the country. Let’s look at what we’re actually spending on carbon, this country borrows somewhere between a billion and $2 billion a day to buy oil, we borrow the money from the Chinese, and we send it to the Saudis, as Jim Woolsey who used to run the CIA, we’re fighting both sides of the war on terror, we pay for our guys and we send money to the guys who pay for the other guys, now this is daft. We know how to eliminate, at least three quarters of that oil, just through smarter technology, so now you and I and the rest of American taxpayers are gonna bail out Detroit because they failed to do this. How about we attach a little string to that money, if we’re gonna own the car companies now, let’s ask them to build the state of the art cars. Any of you ever seen a Tesla? You wanna go real fast? Yeah. We can build safer, faster, peppier, sportier, better cars, that use no energy, now, electric car, okay, you go to Google. Google recently decided that they could make all of their parking lots carports with solar on ‘em…pay back within 10 years, oh, 10 years is a long time, no it’s not. A two-year payback which is what people say they demand, is a 70 percent return on investment. You guys on Wall Street, you tell me where you can get 70 percent return on investment in today’s market. So Google put in these solar--and they have little pull-down plugs, you bring your electric car, you plug it in. Myanext car’s gonna be a plug-in hybrid. My friend Jim Woolsey, the ex-head of the CIA, drives a plug-in hybrid he runs on solar on his roof. Has a little bumper sticker on it, “Osama bin Laden hates my car.” Major reductions in carbon are worth the money. Chicago Climate Exchange, this is a voluntary group of now over 400 businesses, my company is a member…who have pledged to cut their carbon. They have reduced carbon…collectively 8 percent. There’s no law that says they have to, you don’t need taxes, you don’t need Draconian regulation. We simply need to be smart about how we use energy. They represent companies, 20 percent of the Dow Jones industrials, and 17 percent of stationery emissions in this country. California, AB-32, new study out from the University of California, fully implementing the Republican Governor Schwarzenegger’s cap on carbon. And trading regime…would deliver to California $78 billion, in increased state gross product. $78 billion, and 400,000 new jobs. Florida, another Republican governor, Republican task force study, that cutting carbon emissions 51 percent below the business-as-usual projections, would add $28 billion to state gross product, several hundred thousand new jobs. Arizona, even more, 60-some percent cut below now, $5 billion and 200,000 new jobs, there are now studies from 20 states, you add it up…if this country implemented aggressive climate protection measures, 500 billion in increased savings to the country, and 5 million green jobs. That’s where the 5 million green jobs number comes from. So let’s bring it home. 4 Times Square down the, down the road? Looks like a normal building, costs the same to build, uses half the energy, gets its energy from photo-voltaics in the skin of the building, and a fuel cell in the basement. This building can never be turned off. So in the 2003 northeast blackout, remember that? People came from blocks around to camp out underneath it. Genuine homeland security, if we want security, if we want an economy, we wanna have jobs in this country, we will invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Because it’s what gives us the greatest rate of return. Oh, and it also solves the climate problem, assuming there is one. But let’s assume the climate skeptics are right. Everything you would do if you were simply a profit-maximizing capitalist, is exactly what you would do if you were scared to death about climate change. A little company across the river, Voltaics. My friend Peter De Nuvila’s chair of this little company, they make the gas precursors for photo-voltaics. Because they’re selling a lotta their gases to China, they are now a net exporter—they’re making their county a net exporter to China. Again, if we want an economy, we can unleash the greatest…prosperity humanity has ever known. And Bjorn, I share your, your care for people in developing countries, where are we gonna get the money? We’re gonna get it because we’re going to invest in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and those investments are worth the money. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you very much. I want to thank Intelligence Squared and the Rosenkranz Foundation for organizing what I think will be a fun and lively evening. So, the resolution before us is that “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto,” I think it’s important for us to frame that and understand what that means and what it doesn’t mean. The question isn’t whether Google is a great company. I think it is. I thought what Bob Rosenkranz said about it is exactly right, much to admire. The question isn’t whether Google does more good than evil. I think it does. That’s not the question either. The question’s whether we can identify certain things which they do which we think are important to how Google operates, that are inconsistent with that motto. And I think we can. So we should start where that motto comes from. When Google was going to become a public company it filed its registration statement, if you haven’t read those, they’re remarkably dull. Not Google’s. Google opens with an owner’s manual for future Google shareholders. Page and Brin say, we’re not an ordinary company, we’re not gonna be an ordinary company. Get ready for the ride. Okay. Part of that is Google says, we’re gonna live by a motto, and that model is, is we’re not gonna be evil. Seemingly asking us to hold Google to a higher standard, they’re very clear. There’ll be times when they will sacrifice the shortrun interests of Google for the public good. I don’t think what’s legal is the standard to evaluate for Google, Google asks us for something much more public-interested. Google then compares itself to newspapers. Well that’s interesting, right, they seem to be on diverging paths but I think they thought there was some sense of a public trust associated with newspapers, and we should hold Google to that as well. That’s what we’re gonna try to do tonight. My piece of this is I’m going to focus on the heart of Google’s business which is their advertising model. And I’m going to focus on the recent deal that was proposed between Google and Yahoo, where Yahoo was going to out-source a large chunk of its search-ad business to Google. I should say I consulted in connection with the opposition, so you can discount what I say as you wish. I should say we won, that’s good news, because that deal has gone away, the Department of Justice suggested that they were going to challenge the deal in court…that was something clearly Google didn’t want so they backed away from it. All right. Advertisers were opposed to the deal. Why were advertisers opposed. Advertisers believed that the deal and the core of the deal was if you think of search queries, there’s a lot of common queries, there’s a lot of unusual queries. The deal is going to out-source the long tail as it were, Chris Anderson’s term of queries, away from Yahoo to Google. Advertisers were upset about that. Why. Well, advertisers believed that prices were going to go up because of that. Google’s response to that was to say…we run auctions. We don’t set prices. Advertisers set prices. We’re just middlemen. That’s not right, and I think Google knows better. I should say, I’m a Google Ad Words advertiser, so if you’ve not looked at the system, the way it works, you can set an account up very easily, pay five dollars to do so… I’m advertising, I thought I should understand how Ad Words works, so I’m advertising a paper that I wrote on anti-trust and privacy and cloud computing. I’m not sure who the second click has been, um—Okay. But you see how that works. You can click, and go. But the nature of this is that you bid on keyword terms, if you win the auction your ads are supposed to show up. Now Google understands that how you design auctions matters, there’s a whole field of economics devoted to that. They gave William Vickery from Columbia a Nobel Prize for that. Google is designing its auctions in a way that takes advantage of its market power. Does that in three important ways. First, Google runs a system involving minimum bids. So cloud neutrality is one of the terms that I’m bidding on. You can run a search on cloud neutrality, I did yesterday. I know my ad is out there. It didn’t show up, indeed no ads showed up, and indeed if you look at the statistics, 50 percent of the time when you run a search on Google, and they produce results, the organic search results, there are no ads next to it. Even though if you believe the comments, and as I say I’m one of these Ad Words ad—Ad Words advertisers, my ad is out there waiting to be served and even though the search that has been done, if they don’t run an ad it’s an opportunity to show an ad which is lost forever. So there was a chance for Google to get money there and yet they’re not doing it. Why, because if very few people are bidding then I ought to be able to buy it for a very low price and Google’s interest is not served by that. Google wants to make sure that there’s a high enough minimum, they’ve been raising the minimums over time, such that Google meaningfully makes money on that. If you look at the blogs, people comment on this, they talk about bidding against the house, that’s what they have to do. And Google has changed the terms in which they do that. Okay? That’s an exercise in market power. I should say under current US anti-trust law one of the things I do for a living, I don’t think that’s illegal. Evil? Well, that’s the resolution for the house tonight. That’s one. Two. If you’re an auctioneer, the way you exercise market power, is you control the number of slots. Right, you don’t control prices, you control quantities. In Google’s case that means how many slots are available on the right-and side next to the organic search results. Google controls that. Now you might think in a competitive model that we’d have some relationship between the number of ads on Yahoo and the number of ads on Google. Indeed the central premise of the Yahoo-Google deal was that Google does a better job of ad matching than Yahoo does. We should therefore expect Google to have more ads than Yahoo, just the opposite. Again, market power being exercised, not illegal, evil, you decide. Finally, third point. Google engages in a kind of bundling, so Google also organizes search for Ask and AOL. You can buy Google alone, you can’t buy Ask and AOL alone. They are bundled together with Google. Right, advertisers would like to be able to advertise separately on those. Can’t do it, they won’t let you do that. Illegal under US law, EU law? Maybe, we’ll see. Right? Evil, mmm, I think you can conclude. Now, why should we care about this. The importance of advertising is the way that advertising supports paid content. Right? You should care a lot about the kind of content that’s out there, and to the extent that the middleman is making it more expensive for people to reach consumers, we’re going to have less content because producers are effectively going to get a lower chunk of the advertising dollars.  I’ll stop there, thank you."

    "data":"Ladies and gentlemen, it takes a lawyer to know a lawyer. And as a lawyer I want to point out what my colleague just did at the beginning of his talk, he redefined the question. The question tonight is whether Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto.” The question is whether Google is evil or not. And that’s what I want to talk to you about, and I want to urge you to vote no on the resolution. To find that Google is evil, you have to find that people who cut in line are evil. You have to find that, bruised apples are evil. You have to find that flat tires are evil. These things are not evil. Evil is Hitler. Evil is Stalin. Evil is Pol Pot. Evil is…Dr. Evil. That’s somewhat definitional. Google is not evil. Now you have to make some sense of the term to understand these concepts, now...perhaps that phrase was intended in a sort of, Let’s not be a greasy corporation” sense. Even by that standard, Google is not evil, Google is great. Google brings information and empowerment to the masses in ways we couldn’t have imagined just a few years ago. Try it now. Think about how you would you have found out information just a few years ago. It’s a little hard to remember for oldsters like me, but it was very hard. Today it’s much easier. Now there are lots of complaints about Google. Holders of copyrights, say Google’s making use of my copyrights and my property and dada. In fact Google’s making that material more available and more valuable for copyright holders. Holders of trademarks complain precisely because Google is using trademarks in an appropriate way, in Ad Sense, allowing providers to compare their products with other products, bringing consumers lower prices, better products… This is good, this is not evil. Now surely Google should avoid censorship. And one of the toughest areas is the question of censorship. But the Chinese people are better off, with Google in China, slow-wokking their cooperation with the Chinese government, than having no Google in China, and leaving China to Baidu, and whatever local information sources are fully government-approved. On the question of privacy it’s true, that Gmail, Basic Search, Maps, Street View, all of these things, challenge privacy. All of these things are challenges to privacy, but no more than any other apps that are available similarly. This is not a case that Google is evil, perhaps it’s a case that the Internet is evil. But I don’t think anybody here thinks of the Internet as truly evil. Now, some say that Google’s monopoly on search, gives it so much power that this is inherently, somehow evil. Well, Google has a sizable percentage of the search market. I think that’s an admission I can make. But Google is a big company, that’s part of an information big bang, that’s far bigger. Google cannot control us finding out about things. Google cannot prevent criticisms of Google being made. Google’s a big player, but the market is much, much bigger than Google. There’s a more concerning evil, that I want to point you to, and I know none of you indulge this. But some people, who have problems with the way products and services are delivered, do nothing but complain. That’s the evil of apathy. If my colleagues at the far end of the table wish to characterize Google as evil, they should foreswear the use of Google products, and find the other products, which there are, and use those instead. Google’s not evil. In fact… Google’s not evil, Google’s Evel Knievel. Google’s high-flying…Google makes some mistakes. But Google is an American success story. Let me urge you once again, to vote no on the proposition. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you. Thank you all for being here tonight, what a great audience, I have a very simple way of stating my case for the motion. And it’s a conclusion that’s based on some facts, facts are good, so here are a few facts. If you Google Tibetan independence,” you’ll get back pointers to some sites, that advocate the freedom of Tibet from Chinese rule. Tibet.org, Friends of Tibet.org, sites associated with the Dalai Lama, and others. You’ll also get back some sites, that advocate against the freedom of Tibet from Chinese rule. That’s if you go home tonight, and use the version of Google that you have available to you in this country. But if you do it inside China, you won’t get references to Tibet.org, or Friends of Tibet.org, except perhaps, for references, to sites explaining that those are illegal and banned organizations. Or Epic Times, Epic Times is a Chinese newspaper, an uncensored Chinese newspaper. You can find it on the Internet, just Google Epic Times. But try to do that in China, and you will not find your way to Epic Times. Same thing with human rights if you Google that, or various spiritual practices. The world looks very different through the window that Google provides, in China, than through the window on the world that you have available to yourselves here. In fact, it’s not the picture window on the world, it’s a distorted lens that has been built, custom-built by Google to Chinese specifications. Now how did that happen. Google is the company, whose mission is to organize the world’s information, and to make it universally accessible and useful. How did it come to be in the business of creating the distorting lens, rather than the picture window on the world. Well, in 2004, Google was entering the international market, it wanted to be the number-one search engine in the world, it started to do business in China. And the Chinese said, we don’t want you to show our citizens the world as it really is, with all of its complexities, and its contradictions, and its inconsistent sources of information. We want the Chinese citizens to know the world the way we want them to know the world. And, Google said, okay, we’ll give them that world instead of the world as it really is. Their choice was, to accept the Chinese ultimatum, or to go home. They could’ve gone home, they didn’t, they stayed, and built the engine as the Chinese wanted it. Now it’s a wonderful product. I agree with everything that’s been said about what a wonderful product it is and what a wonderful company it is. But here it’s been turned from a wonderful product, that we know, into an instrument of thought control. Now some may weakly claim that it’s doing more good than harm… that the Chinese people are better off getting partial information via the Google search window than getting no information at all. That’s nonsense, there are other search warrants, through which you can get the censored truth, if that’s what you want people to provide. Google didn’t choose the lesser of two evils when faced with the Chinese ultimatum; it chose the more profitable of the two evils. And for that reason, you should vote for the proposition, that Google is violating its Don’t be evil” motto. They had a simple choice that was put before them. I stopped a street vendor here in New York last week, who was selling Tibetan jewelry, he’s a Tibetan. And I said, I’m gonna debate this issue. What do you think the answer is, I don’t have to explain it to him, he knew exactly that Google works differently inside China, than it does here. And here is what he said—he said, Google had a choice between morality and money, and it chose money. That’s why Google is violating its ‘Don’t be evil’ motto. It’s a company that does many good works. It’s true that Google as a whole is not evil, I’ll grant that, but that’s not the question before us. If the question before us was, Google is evil, that’s what the question would be. That isn’t the question, the question is, does it violate what it claims not to do—not being evil. A good indicator that you’re doing something wrong is that the Congress hauls your executives, in front of them, and yells at you. And Congress has gotten into the habit of doing this several times. Most recently in May. Senator Richard Durbin confronted Google executives on this censorship question, and said, When you’re asked to be complicit in restricting the flow of information, aren’t your hands a little dirty at the end of the day if you participate in that.” There is legislation under consideration, to prohibit exactly what Google is doing. Now to be sure, Google is in the business to make money, if it doesn’t sell advertising anywhere, then it’s not going to make money, but it’s making plenty of money. And it would have been such a statement, to the international world about the importance of, of information freedom. My friends, you are here tonight, because you value the robust debate of conflicting ideas. You value facts, you believe the truth is revealed, through this kind of debate and conflict. You should—you must vote for this proposition, if you support the idea that creating censorship tools is a form of evil. Finally, just let me close with one analogy. Suppose Google were not a search engine company, but a pharmaceutical company. And it was told by the Chinese government that it could sell aspirin in China, only if it also made certain forms of brainwashing drugs and thought control medications. And that was the condition on which it could sell aspirin in China. No responsible American company would make that deal with the Chinese authorities, and that is exactly what Google is doing in the digital realm. So, please vote for the motion, Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto”, because they do. Thank you."

    "data":"Yes. Uh— So I was going to start by saying that I actually spend a fair amount of time with things I consider evil. And I mean that quite seriously, the old Soviet system, which, you still see some vestiges of, in Star City where I’m training. I travel a lot, I’ve seen many ways to be evil, I’ve examined governments, I’ve talked to people who… I’m on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy, and we give grants to dissidents, so, that informs my thinking, as does the fact that I was chairman of ICANN, which is the organization that sets policy for the Internet. We made a lot of mistakes, I don’t think we were evil but we probably came a lot closer to it than Google ever did, or will. But finally in terms of the disclosures you probably want to know, I’m on the board of 23andMe which was founded, cofounded by Sergey Brin’s wife. I’m on the board of WPP Group, which calls Google its frenemy, or its froe. They’re a large advertising conglomerate. And finally, I’m on the board of Yandex, which competes with Google in Russia where, Yandex has 60 percent market share and Google has approximately 20. So I kind of come at this from many different points of view. And, I believe that Google does not violate it’s Don’t be evil” motto because I’ve seen it up close, I’ve also seen it from outside, I’ve seen it as a competitor, I’ve seen how they try to do things. And I am very glad to hear all this discussion of China because I’m going to blow it to bits in a few moments. But first I want to go through the few…the couple of arguments I wanted to talk about. The challenge of power, is great. The great virtue of the Internet is that it erodes power, it sucks power out of the center, and takes it to the periphery, it erodes the power of institutions over people, while giving to individuals the power to run their own lives. Google is part of that. It’s one of these things that shines light on everything, it enables people to find stuff out, it enables them to question what their governments are doing, and it’s absolutely wonderful. That doesn’t mean that power cannot be abused. The abuse of power is absolutely evil. Google to some extent understands this very well, that’s why they bothered to have this motto in the first place, they understand the danger of concentration of power, and they understand how important it is not to be evil, that’s why they have shareholder agreements that give them more power so that they don’t need to cater only to money-hungry investors but can also do what they think is right. There are three people who set policies there, it’s the two founders and Eric Schmidt. And they watch one another, they’re very careful not to abuse this Don’t be evil” thing. Now, the power that Google has is primarily a good power though it could be used to do evil, it’s not like atom bombs. It’s not like guns…or even cigarettes, which when used correctly are destructive. The power of transparency, the power of knowledge, is fundamentally good, even though it can on occasion be used for bad. And so Google’s trust is to ensure that that power is used for good as much as possible. I have seen what they’re doing in China. And ladies and gentlemen, the reason they’re not violating their Don’t be evil” policy is because they’re in there, and they’re engaged. Yes, they could abdicate, they could say we’re not gonna bother to go into China. But every time some Chinese person uses Google, and doesn’t get what he wants, he may notice, he may not even notice the absence, but he does know that he can go find out all the negative information on George Bush he wants. And at some point, he or she says, well, gee. If I can get—or whatever the Chinese version is—if I can get this bad information about George Bush why can’t I find out more about what’s going on in my own country. Google by its very presence and its operation, even if it’s incomplete, creates increasing expectations for transparency, it starts people answering questions. It gets them to expect to be able to find out stuff. And it knows that by doing that, people are going to start asking more questions. So I think Google was doing the right thing, by going into China. I don’t think they’re making that much money there, if they are that’s fine too. But the point of it is, they are engaging. I know another example, in which they’re getting engaged. They have a service, you’ve probably encountered it, where if you go to a website—if you get a search result that indicates a website that may have some malware on it, they warn you off. This is very expensive for them to do. They need to detect the sites with malware, they need to inform them that there’s malware. They have a dispute-resolution process, they’re not perfect, but again, they’re engaging where they didn’t need to. They could easily have just passed the query through. But they’re trying to make the world a better place, by doing something that requires them to make judgments. Sometimes they may incorrectly flag a site as having malware, sometimes, somebody has malware unintentionally, they need to deal with it. So the point here again is that rather than just being apathetic, as Jim said, they’re engaging, and trying to make the world a better place. So I believe, that they do not violate their motto and I think you should vote against the proposition. Thank you."

Specifically, Pope Gregory the Great, and the great poet Dante Alighieri. Because after all, one of the things we have to figure out here, is what do we mean by evil. Well Google encourages us to think algorithmically, after all it’s built everything that it has on algorithms. One of the simplest forms of algorithms, the if-then statement, or if you prefer, the checklist, Dante offers us such a checklist in The Divine Comedy. I know you know it, I know you know it with me, so say it along with me, the seven deadly sins, luxuria, gula, avaritia, acedia, ira, invidia, and superbia, right? Well, okay, you didn’t say it along with me. To walk through, I can show you that Google has at times committed every single one of these seven deadly sins.The first, luxuria, which translates as extravagance or lust. I spent a bit of time on the Google campus out in California…they get massages. Right, the people who work there get massages. That is, that is corporeal lust of the highest order. Or at least for a bunch of geeks about the best they’re gonna do. Um…Number two, gula or gluttony, the other thing about the Google campus is they get incredible food, all they can eat all day, no matter what they want, there is so much food that they never need to say no, that is the very definition of gluttony. Number three. Avaritia, greed. We’ve already heard from Randy about the greed embodied in the Google-Yahoo advertising deal…that is one of many examples of Google overreaching to corner a market, or completely undermine a market, in an effort to maximize its returns. Number four, acedia, sloth. Now I could talk about how lazy and self-satisfied Google was in its effort to roll out an online video service. The early days of Google Video were very much a matter of figuring they owned the video realm and they weren’t actually gonna do anything new or fantastic until these whippersnappers at YouTube came across with their Flash video platform, and basically ran around them to the point where they ended up having to buy that company just to keep pace. But there’s actually a better example of sloth and that is Google itself, its very nature, its very model of advertising is based on free-riding. Google makes money off of our work. We blog, we put our skate—our cats on skateboards and record them for videos. We do all of this work, and then Google harvests our work, runs all of this content through this computers, spits it back out at us, with almost no actual value added and what we end up getting is a tremendous amount of money, based on freeriding, the very definition of sloth. Wrath, ira, wrath. There are a number of high-profile cases of people who have been involved with Google through their Ad Sense program, through which they’ve agreed to place ads on their own blogs. I think Jeff is one of these people but not one who has suffered the wrath of Google. Many of these people have found their accounts shut down, their revenues stopped, for reasons that can never be explained, but they did something to violate Google’s policies. But they get no feedback and no response, and no justice. And then there are hundreds of small companies all around America, that have found their ranks decimated, their Google ranks decline significantly, because again, they tried to optimize their results, they were just doing what a company should do, trying to get more attention for themselves. And Google’s algorithms, its faceless, soulless algorithms came at them with wrath, another of the seven deadly sins. Invidia, envy. Google has over the last few years engaged in a series of efforts to try to muscle in on the markets of other successful companies, Microsoft being the most prominent. Google has recently tried to push its suite of services that directly compete with Microsoft Office. Of course they have at various times threatened to muscle out eBay, muscle out PayPal, muscle out Amazon, in various ways. Number seven, the one I want to talk about the most, superbia, pride, or hubris. Now, let me remind you of the actual motto of the company, it’s not Do no evil” or Don’t be evil,” it’s actually, To organize the world’s information to make it universally accessible.” What could be more hubristic than that. What could be more prideful than that. General Motors doesn’t say we’re gonna organize all the places in the country and make them universally accessible. General Motors says we’re gonna try to sell cars. Not that that’s the best example to use this week, I understand. Nonetheless, no company besides Google would ever come up with a motto or a mission statement like that, but let me tell you something that Sergey Brin, one of the founders of Google said a number of years ago, during an interview when someone asked him, what would the perfect search engine be like. And he said, without missing a beat, it would be like the mind of God. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s more than hubris, that’s blasphemy. Now the particular kind of hubris that energizes Google is of course, a sense of techno-fundamentalism. The notion that you can always invent something, to solve the problem that the last invention created. And that faith in technology, that technology can cover all of our sins and all of our faults and fix all of our problems, is again the ultimate hubris, it’s the hubris expressed in the myth of Pandora for instance, the myth of having too much knowledge. There are so many examples in human history in which techno fundamentalism has led to great suffering. Not that Google is about to lead us to great suffering, but they’re still committing the sin of hubris. Now hubris is actually the most serious of the seven deadly sins. As Dante explains to us, it was the sin that Lucifer committed. Lucifer was a good guy. Lucifer fell, because he thought he could be as effective as God, as good as God, and thus, he became Satan. The very notion of the Don’t be evil” motto, is itself hubristic, is itself, evil, because it is itself a violation of the seven deadly sins. One real-world example, let me finish with very quickly, Google Book Search. Google has been trying to scan in 36 million books from libraries around the world, in an effort to essentially corner the market on digital book access, for a number of years. Early on, four years ago when it started this project or got public with this project, it claimed that everything was cool as far as copyright was concerned. In other words, copyright only applies to mere mortals, not to superhuman super companies like Google. Well, it turns out Google wasn’t right about that, last month Google ended up having to settle, and wrote a check for $125 million to publishers and authors [sic], because it turns out, they weren’t quite as on the ball about copyright as they thought. Thank you very much."

    "data":"And I guess in both full disclosure and a plug I should say I have a book coming out called, What Would Google Do? You're just jealous. Massage would feel good right now, wouldn't it? We should remember where this pledge came from. The chiefs of Google have said that the real purpose of the Don’t Be Evil” pledge is to give employees the license to remind their bosses of this in meetings. So, a geek can stand there and say, is that evil? The kind of thing a geek would say. And it’s, it’s useful. Imagine, ladies and gentleman, if we had that phrase, don’t be evil,” chiseled over every door on Wall Street. Would we not have a better world today? In this poisoned process that led to the financial crisis, if just one, or two, or five, or ten people had said, Hmm… taking poison mortgages, or giving them, is that evil? Creating poison assets and selling them, is that evil? So, I think it’s important to just recognize that the rule itself is good. The fact that Google asks it is good. And we should wish that it shouldn't be special subject of a debate that a company promises not to be evil. The fact that it’s special is, itself, a virtue. So, I would like to match the seven deadly sins with eight, I’ll beat you, virtues of Google. And let’s remember that virtue does leaven evil. We all mess up, right? So virtue matters. So number one, Google has opened up, as my colleagues have said, the world’s knowledge to the world, or stipulate China, most of the world’s knowledge to most of the world. And that’s important. It has changed our very view of facts and knowledge and accuracy. No longer do we end an argument saying, I don’t know. We go to Google. Google will tell us. And it will tell us that in a blink of an eye. Now, in fact, I went to Google, and I asked Google how fast does an eye blink. And it told me in point three seconds that an eye blinks in point three seconds. Your life is richer now because of Google. Number two, Google respects the wisdom of the crowd. We are too often not respected. There’s a snobbishness about my old colleagues in big old media. Google doesn't have that. Google learns what it learns because it trusts us. Isn't that nice? Shouldn't companies do that? Shouldn't politicians do that? Wouldn't trust matter? Google in its very essence trusts us. Number three, Google takes the wisdom of the crowd, it knows we have wisdom, and it gives it back to us. It gives us our own knowledge. Look at the Google flu trends search. It lets us know how often we search for a flu, and how the flu trend is coming. That is our knowledge, not Google’s. Google shares our own knowledge with us, it gives it back, it does add value, if not flaming cat videos, to our own wisdom. Google connects people. This is so important. We often are accused on line of being anti-social. I think we’ve become hyper-social. I think we’re more connected. I met Esther and Siva because of Google, because of searches. I looked at Google, and there’s Siva on the other side. And so I think the importance of Google connecting people cannot be underestimated. Our children today connect in ways across cultures we don’t even know, yes sometimes it makes us nervous, but I think that it can only be good. Admit it, how many of you have searched Google for an old girlfriend or boyfriend? Aw, come on, you liars. Now, part of the problem is, I can say this because I have gray hair, that probably, the probability of finding someone is inversely proportional to your age. But young people will stay connected to their friends for the rest of their lives. Imagine the impact that will have on friendship and society, and Google is the mechanism that makes that happen. Five, Google creates platforms, it is a platform that enables us to create. A recent poll said eighty percent of Americans think they have a book in them. We should be glad that most don’t come out. But we have seen in Google that it is an age of creation, and Google creates the platforms, the tools to let us create, the means to let us pay for that. I think that’s very, very important. Six, Google does have ads. Last year I made a big four thousand, five hundred dollars on Google ads. I shouldn't quit the day job, I know. But, if you want to compare, my dear colleagues on the other side, the view of Google toward its advertising structure, compare it to a monopoly newspaper, which set the price, which set its own rules, which allowed you to only do so many things with their space, well, no, we can do what we want with our ads. We can start whole businesses with it. We can create movements with it. We can be found with it. That’s important. And I believe that Google ads will help support the future even of news. Seven, Google.org, the foundation started by Google, is supported by one percent of the equity, and one percent of the profits of the company. And it is trying to solve, with hubris, the problem of energy and global warming in one fell swoop. But I’ve learned that they're doing it in a unique techno-smart way, the way engineers do. Engineers solve problems. We have a problem, they're looking for the solution. Politicians are trying to get us on energy with regulation and taxes and prohibitions and slaps on the wrist. Google is giving this investment, and innovation, and invention. And if it can solve the problem of power cheaper than coal, then we don’t have to save anymore, we can use as much as we want. Google understands abundance. Finally, eight, Google has a new model on how to treat employees. We get, they get, massages. Finally, I want to say that Google teaches us to understand our new world in new ways. And if we are too critical of Google I think we give up that opportunity to see this new world and understand it through the lens of Google. In this new economy, I don’t think companies will be built anymore by huge capital, making huge acquisitions, they will be built, as Google has, through networks and platforms. We have a lot to learn from Google. As we try to understand this new world of links and connectedness and platforms and networks and generosity and speed, we would do well to ask ourselves, what would Google do?” Google is not evil. In the examples it gives, and in the fact that it vows not to be evil, Google is a model to us all. Our world is better off because we have Google. So please, have a moment of decency, and vote against the motion."

    "data":"Thank you so much John, and thank you all for being here tonight. I wanted to begin also by thanking Intelligence Squared and the Rosenkranz Foundation and Neustar for hosting this event. This is an important issue; this is one of those issues that’s being discussed here in Washington, in Congress and the White House and your views, your assessment of want the country should do with regard to the threat of cyber warfare is very important and we thank you for being here tonight. We’re going to ask you tonight to consider the proposition of whether the threat of cyber war has been grossly exaggerated. Keep in mind the statement of the proposition. We’re not talking about cyber attack, cyber concerns, cyber worry, or not being able to boot up your email. This is a debate about cyber war and how serious that threat is. I’d like to share with you a few statements that I uncovered as I was preparing for this debate. One of the leading experts on cyber war said, Digital Pearl Harbors are happening every day.” The person who has been named to head the U.S. cyber command, the current director of the National Security Agency said U.S. military networks are seeing hundreds of thousands of probes a day.” And one of our opponents in the debate tonight has compared the threat of cyber warfare with nuclear war. Now Bruce and I are going to try to explain to you why it is that we believe that these statements overstate the problem. We are certainly aware of the full range of risks to the Internet and there are many different actors out there. Some of them with criminal intent, some of them are spies; some of them are just curious. We used to call them hackers in the good ole days. All of them pose various types of threat to the Internet as we know it, but if we reduce all of these threats to the catch-all of cyber war, I am concerned that it will take our country in a direction that we will very much regret. But tonight we are not only going to try to persuade you that the threat of cyber war has in fact been grossly exaggerated, we are going to try to explain to you why this has happened. In fact, what you are hearing now about the threat of cyber war is part of a long running campaign here in Washington to move control of the Internet, the technical standards and the openness that we have enjoyed away from its current model to one that would give the intelligence community and the National Security Agency much greater authority to decide what people may or may not do on the Internet. And that effort has been underway long before the stories that you will hear tonight about Russian hackers and Chinese plans to take over the Internet and even attacks launched from North Korea. Back in the 1970s, the NSA worried about the public availability of encryption; the key security standard that today makes possible the routine transactions you engage in when you buy a book on Amazon or download a song from iTunes. NSA didn't want that encryption technology widely available, and they fought against it. Fortunately, computer researchers pressed on, and encryption became widely available and provided a key technique to make possible secure online transactions. But then, in the 1980s, along came John Poindexter who would later come up with Total Information Awareness, and he worried about unsecured private computer networks -- does any of this sound familiar -- back in 1984. And he wanted the National Security Agency to be responsible for computer security in the United States. Fortunately, the Congress didn't like that idea. They pressed back on Mr. Poindexter and the White House, and we established open standards to safeguard network security, but this is not the end of the story. Because then again in the early 1990s, as encryption was becoming more widely available and the NSA worried that they could not intercept private communications, they said to Internet users and American business, You have to use a new technology that we've developed, called Clipper, the escrow key encryption standard. Anytime you want to send a private e-mail, we need a copy of that key that you used to encrypt your communication because we want to be able to know what is contained in your private messages. And again, Congress pushed back and Internet users pushed back, and the Clipper chip proposal put forward by the NSA in the early 1990s was rejected. The story continues. After 9-11, NSA was there again arguing for control of the Internet to try to protect our nation against terror attacks. Now, don't misunderstand our argument tonight. We are aware of these threats, and we are not going to try to persuade you that there are not threats out there that are serious and real and that we should ignore. That is not our argument. Our argument is that we have to be very careful about allowing a single, secret, unaccountable government agency, which has been fighting for 25 years to take control of Internet security, to become the dominant authority for the Internet, which is what will happen if you accept the proposition that the threat of cyber war has not been grossly exaggerated. So, we urge you this evening not only to side with our side, to agree that this threat has been exaggerated, but also to understand why it has been exaggerated. There are agencies in Washington that want very much to know what's in your e-mail. They want to know when you log online. They want to be able to build big databases and detect patters. And this is the threat that Bruce and I will try to respond to. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you. The translation of experience is age. The bad news is age. The good news is grandchildren. But let me humanize just a second. A little under the weather. Two grandsons come to see me. The oldest runs into the room and says, Grandpa, Grandpa, make a sound like a frog. And I said, Son, what for? He said, We're talking to Grandma and she said as soon as you croak, she's taking us all to Disney Land. That's what age does for you. Let me compliment Marc on his argument. And I want to say up front, I agree with everything Marc said about the essence of what makes us Americans: privacy and civil liberties. However, I disagree and urge you to vote against this proposition because of how he framed it. Let me just quote, Our argument is do not let a single authority, the National Security Agency,” agency I was chosen to lead, control the Internet.” It has nothing to do - it has nothing to do with this debate. Now-- I want to just, if you’ll bear with me for just a second, just a small amount of time here; I want to make reference to people who are informed at the highest level with all of the information: our last three presidents. President Clinton focused on this subject; he had a special panel review it and he concluded that it was critical to the nation that we move to address this set of vulnerabilities. President Bush who I had the pleasure to serve along with serving President Obama, said, and I’ll just quote, in the last few years, threats in cyber security have risen dramatically. The policy of the United States is to protect against the debilitating disruption of operations in our information systems for critical infrastructures.” Later, when I had a chance to serve on the inside again, I made my case to President Bush and he supported a comprehensive national cyber security initiative. The Congress agreed and a bill was passed. Now, we’ve got a new administration. The new administration did not agree with the previous administration, huge policy differences in every dimension. We made our case to President Obama and he said, I will take it under review.” After reviewing it for a considerable period of time, he said, one year ago, we meet today at a transformational moment, a moment in history, when our inter-connected world presents at once with great promise but also great peril. It’s the great irony of our information age, the very technologies that empower us to create and to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy. The key is disrupt and destroy. I’m not talking about hackers. I’m not talking about criminals, lots of statistics. I’m not even talking about China and what China has done to take information out of this country. I’m talking about destruction of data. Let me give you just a way to think about it. The United States economy is $14 trillion a year. Two banks in New York City move $7 trillion a day. On a good day, they do eight trillion. Now think about that. Our economy is $14 trillion. Two banks are moving $7 trillion to $8 trillion a day. There is no gold; they’re not even printed dollar bills. All of those transactions, all those transactions are massive reconciliation and accounting. If those who wish us ill, if someone with a different world view was successful in attacking that information and destroying the data, it could have a devastating impact, not only on the nation, but the globe. And that’s the issue that we’re really debating. We are so interconnected; we have enjoyed the benefits of the information technology revolution. It’s touched everyone in this room. From the time you got up this morning in an air conditioned space; you bought gasoline for your car with a credit card. You do online banking; you have power routed to your home. We’re on a path to increase the digitization of the country. Medical care will be improved because of information technology. We can move the information; we can understand trends and we can protect privacy. And the arguments that our opponents are going to mount are this is an argument about privacy and civil liberties; it is not. We can have both. I was privileged to serve the National Security Agency as its director. I was there for the debate over clipper chip and the other things that were mentioned. What I would encourage you to do, since I’m going to be out of time in just a second, is bring that topic up when we have a chance to have the dialogue with questions from the audience. And I will tell the story from a little bit different perspective. I did serve on the inside; I have served on the outside, so I’ve had the privilege of seeing it from both sides. That’s not fair to you the audience, because I live in a classified world. We have a system of representative government. Those representatives that speak for you are cleared; they’re informed; their responsibility is oversight. The equivalent of the National Security Agency was breaking Nazi Germany’s code in World War II. Historians argue that that probably shortened the war by 18 months to two years, saved countless lives and incredible resources. Did the American people have the right to know that NSA was breaking Nazi Germany code in World War II? Because if they had known, the Germans would have known, and all they had to do was take it away by changing the rotors. Secrecy gets a very bad name in our society. American citizens don't like spies in spite of the fact that the first spy master was George Washington. Secrecy is a necessity. And I would summarize by saying we have laws and the key is getting the law correct. If the law is written appropriately and there is the appropriate oversight committee, if you violate the law, you will be held accountable. In a nation as free and as wonderful as ours is, leading the world in human rights and privacy and civil liberties, it's getting the debate framed right to mitigate the risk, to protect the nation consistent with our values and our laws. I urge you to vote against this resolution."

    "label":"technology",
    "data":"So, we're here today to debate the motion that the threat of cyber war is grossly exaggerated. And I also, in preparing, read a book full of articles and have some choice quotes. Mike McConnell said in an op-ed in the Washington Post in February of this year that the United States is fighting a cyber war today and we're losing. So, cyber war is going on right now in our country. Amit Yoran, who did cyber policy, cyber security under Bush, I believe, said that cyber 9/11 has happened over the past 10 years, but it's happened so slowly that we don't see it. So, 9/11, you know, thousands of people dead, billions of dollars of damage, has happened, and we just didn't notice it like the cyber war we're currently losing. In 2007, Germany -- and it's a great -- this is a great newspaper headline -- Germany attacks China for starting the cyber war. This is actually great because when Germany attacks China, they are attacking them by yelling at them because China started a cyber war. Another headline, same incident: China declares war on western search sites. You can actually declare cyber war on search engines. I don't know if you knew that. An article from an Australian magazine, The Independent, February of this year: Hackers declare cyber war on Australia. So, cyber war is so easy, even kids can do it. This year, London Times, March of this year: Cyber war declared as China hunts for the West's intelligence secrets. And last year -- actually, Fourth of July last year there was a cyber war in the United States, headlines all over the place. I have one from the Wall Street Journal: Cyber blitz hits U.S. and Korea. In this instance, there were some denial-of-service attacks against Web sites in South Korea and the United States, which happen, we think, from North Korea. There were a bunch of congressmen actually proposing that we attack Korea in response, except we think the attacks might have come from the U.K., which would have been awkward, or, actually, from Florida, which would have been really awkward. Okay, so this is silly, right? I mean, when we talk about cyber war in the headlines, in the rhetoric, we're not talking about war. This is a rhetorical war, right? It's the war on drugs, it's the war on poverty. It's a really neat way of phrasing it to get people's attention, right, and to make an interesting headline. Now, what's going on really is a blurring of the threats. There are a lot of threats out there. Cyber war is one, cyber crime; we’ve heard about cyber terrorism, cyber-hooliganism, cyber activism. And it often can be really hard to figure out what’s happening. And just think about how we respond to these sorts of threats. When something happens to us, it can be the response from the FBI or from the military or from the Secret Service or from Homeland Security and it depends on who’s attacking us and why. And when we don’t know who’s attacking us and why, it can be very easy to call it war. But in most cases, it’s not, right? There’s a lot -- and -- I took quick notes, I probably got them wrong, some of McConnell’s statements, some of the quotes about, that we need to address the vulnerabilities, that the threats in cyber security have risen dramatically. Again, we’re hearing -- yes these are true, there are threats, there are vulnerabilities; cyber security’s a big deal, but they’re not war threats. Probably in the debate later, we’re going to go into some of the examples of cyber war. I just mentioned Korea attacking the U.S. A big one was in Estonia; it’s been called the first cyber war. And basically, someone or some country, some believe it’s Russia, announced a denial of service attack against a bunch of Estonia websites, so it’s kind of like the army marches into your country and then gets in line at the motor vehicle bureau so you can’t get your driver’s license renewed. That’s sort of what that looks like. The only person they’ve ever found who they can convict of this was a 22 year old Russian living in Tallinn who was annoyed about a statue falling down. So I mean, we’re now where we can’t tell foreign invaders from bored kids. The other events we talk about, China was mentioned a little bit. I mean yes, there’s a huge intelligence threat. China’s doing a lot of targeting against Google, against others. Marc mentioned the enormous number of attacks per day against government networks. That number actually is pretty reasonable for all of your computers as well. We’re talking about different worms and viruses; lots of threats, again not cyber war. So, I urge you to really think critically about what we’re talking about. Metaphors matter. If we frame this discussion as a war discussion, then what you do when there’s a threat of war is you call in the military and you get military solutions. You get lockdown; you get an enemy that needs to be subdued. If you think about these threats in terms of crime, you get police solutions. And as we have this debate, not just on stage, but in the country, the way we frame it, the way we talk about it; the way the headlines read, determine what sort of solutions we want, make us feel better. And so the threat of cyber war is being grossly exaggerated and I think it’s being done for a reason. This is a power grab by government. What Mike McConnell didn’t mention is that grossly exaggerating a threat of cyber war is incredibly profitable. The last article I saw said there’s about $400 million in Booz Allen contracts on cyber war. You don’t get those by saying you know, this is kind of dumb. But, it really is. The threats are real; the threats are serious; cyber space is not a safe place, but these are not war threats. For the threat of cyber war to be serious means you believe the threat of war is serious. And if you’re not worried about war, --you can’t be more worried about cyber war; that just doesn’t make sense. I guess I’ll be back when it’s discussion time."

    "data":"Thank you so much. Thank you to the Rosenkranz Foundation, Intelligence Squared, and thank you Bruce for promising not to hack the voting devices that we're using tonight in the program. So, here's where we're at so far. Marc says, Vote for us if you don't want a police state. Bruce says, Vote for us if you think journalists and their headline writers and sometimes their sources exaggerate, and, Vote for us if you don't want a military state. So, I stand here proudly before you in the negative, despite the fact that I do not want a police state. I do think that journalists and their headline writers sometimes exaggerate -- is it okay to say that in the Newseum? Is that all right? Did you see, by the way, if you're particularly a fan of the news, you can live here. There are Newseum residences, which is -- There's like a bat pole and you can go down and read the headlines. I can't believe I've just used a minute in this opening, but -- and we all agree that the use of the word cyber is probably a bridge too far. If you at least agree with that, please send me -- Yes. You can applaud or send me some cyber mail, and I will send you a reply. What we heard from Mike were some scenarios that were kind of the watershed event scenarios, and I don't know about you, but after his rip on the banking system, I might be going to my nearest ATM and purchasing a brand-new hollow mattress. I want to give a more gradual view of the vulnerabilities that you'll notice both Bruce and Marc handily acknowledge. Oh, we're not saying the system works. In fact, we agree it's utterly vulnerable. We just don't like the use of the word 'war,' and we don't like the use of the word ‘war' because it might give people a platform through which to have bad things happen after that, to militarize or to create a police state or something like that. Well, fine. We have to argue against that, but let us be truth-tellers about the state of vulnerability in our networks and our endpoints, and then deal with it from there, neither exaggerating nor understating it. So, what kind of threat am I talking about? Let me just give you two quick examples. The network itself. The Internet is an utterly bizarre network, and to answer your question, John, the more I study it, the more I am just agog that it functions at all. And there are plenty of Internet engineers who --remain puzzled and say, well, it's just a pilot project. The jury's still out. So, for example, to get a piece of data from one end to another, like this pen up to the back of the room, the sane, rational way to do it would be to hire somebody, to have a Newseum employee who would take it up there, and then if it didn't get there, we would know whom to blame. Call it the FedEx method of getting it there. The way the Internet does it is basically like a big bucket brigade. I pass it to the front row, it goes back, would you mind, would you mind, or for sports fans, kind of like beer at a Red Sox game, right? You gain nothing except soiled trousers by doing it, but there is a strong normative presumption that you will pass the beer. Now, this also leads to structural vulnerability, because if you drink the beer or if you pass it forward instead of sideways, it doesn't get to where it's going. And it turns out that in 2008, the state of Pakistan, as is its wont, asked its Internet service providers to prevent people in Pakistan from getting the YouTube. There was something there that they didn't like. And one ISP, as kind of a parlor trick, chose to implement that block by announcing within the stands of fans that are ISPs here, that it, in fact, was YouTube. And this is a decentralized system. So, its announcement meant that packets that would otherwise be going to YouTube went to them from their subscribers. And then it resonated like ripples in a pond from one ISP to another like dominoes until with about two minutes, anywhere in the world, if you were trying to get to YouTube, your packets were going to Pakistan and they weren't coming back. Now, that is not only downright weird, it is an example of just a whole genus of vulnerabilities that are extremely difficult to fix. Now, was that an act of war? Definitely not. Is it a vulnerability such that if you had malice towards a state that relies asymmetrically on this network and decided that you wanted to use this as an instrument of your aggression, could you do so? Absolutely, and I do not believe you will hear them say otherwise. That's why you hear Bruce saying against the straw people of there's a cyber war already in progress. All right, I don't think there's a cyber war going on right now against us in America, but boy are the vulnerabilities there. So long as there is the vulnerability, all we need is the motivation, and I don't want to rest on the good graces of any state around the world, or for that matter any 12-year-old, that wants to try to take down the net. And, he's not 12, but I did ask Ed Felten, computer scientist at Princeton, once, I said, You know, if you're in a 24- like scenario and your life depended on it, and you had to bring down huge swathes of the net and you only had a week to do it, kind of planting the seeds in the head I said could you do it. And he thought about it really careful, and he said, could I have two weeks? And that’s the kind of thing that did not make me feel better. Now, Robert Rosencranz, one of our hosts, mentioned GhostNet, our collaborators in the Open Net initiative at Toronto and up at Harvard, worked to expose this network that they named GhostNet where basically this wasn’t run of the mill Trojans that all of us have right now on our machines while we think we’re playing solitaire and in fact our machines are spamming each other. This isn’t a run of the mill Trojan; these are the ones targeted to particular people and institutions that a government might have interest in, compromising the machines and leaving them open on average for over 200 days, where they’ve got the keys to the kingdom. They can surveil everything; they can control the machine. How do we know? Because our researchers hacked that system and then could see what they saw. We saw the ministries of foreign affairs of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Brunei, open to us, if all we wanted to do was grab the files. The embassies of Germany, Romania, Cyprus, the Associated Press, not the embassy, the Associated Press itself, and NATO headquarters, exposed through our view of this system. That’s something that says to me, to the extent that surveillance and spy craft is an instrument of war, war is what you have. So I am concerned as, is I think everybody here about protecting civil liberties, about not having the responses to this problem be too quick, too panicked, too corporate, or too military. There are solutions that I hope we can talk about in the panel, to avoid too far in any of those directions. But let us be clear about the problem. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you very much, it’s such a pleasure to be here. You know, I feel very comfortable, I have to say, at the outset with the opposing team, sharing a podium with people with very different views about drugs, immigration, Mexico, because, my show at CNN is actually taped in the same studios as Lou Dobbs’s. So I shared— I shared studio space with Lou Dobbs, I can share a platform with you gentlemen, I’m delighted to do so. Look, what I thought I would do is try to convince you as best I can, that you should vote for this proposition. And, we are on the 40th anniversary of the drug war. The war on drugs was declared by Richard Nixon, and it began a vast effort by the United States government, to transform the issue of drugs into one about criminality and war. And it began a massive program in the United States that has spread throughout the region. The results are in, 40 years out, I would argue. We have spent about $1 trillion. That does not count by the way what local and state governments spend every year, to enforce the war on drugs, which is $41 billion. Every year. Now, if you look at any metric, I would argue, that would be reasonable to apply the availability of drug use, the potency of drugs, for the most part the price—the metrics suggest the drug war has failed, it has done nothing to dampen demand, it has perhaps in many ways increased potency, and certainly increased criminality. So, if you look at the simplest statistic in terms of what the effect of this vast war on drugs has had over the last 40 years. In the 1970s, the United States had the same incarceration rate, as every other country in the world. We were about at the world average in terms of how many people we imprisoned, as a percentage of our population. That rate today, is five times the world average. In 1980, those blissful, halcyon days of 1980, we had 41,000 people in prison on drug-related charges. Today we have 500,000 people. So, if you ask yourself, what the effect in the United States has been it seems to me plain, it is blindingly obvious. The question, I suppose, we have to then ask ourselves is what is the effect outside the United States, because there has been another effect of this war on drugs, which has been to internationalize the problem. Because we began this process, by interdicting in Miami, and then started moving to the sources, because the sources also started fleeing offshore. Then we went into Central America. You all remember that before we had the heroic wars of liberation in Afghanistan and Iraq we had the heroic war of liberation in Panama, where Manuel Noriega was indicted in a US court for drug dealing and we decided to send the US Army there, play very loud rock music, I am not kidding, and effectively arrested him. What has happened in almost all those cases is, the supply then shifts. And so it then shifted to Colombia, and we began Plan Colombia, which has been a vast, multi-year effort with many, many hundreds of American soldiers. When we talk about Mexico’s drug war which I will get to, one has to remember, that the wars on drugs that the United States has initiated over the last 40 years, have very much been ones involving troops and soldiers and bullets and deaths. Mexico is only the last in a long line of these drug wars. And so we got to Colombia, where the United States has now spent something in the range of eight to $10 billion. Colombia for many years was the second or third largest recipient of US aid, and much of that aid has gone toward intensely military activities. The GAO, the Government Accounting Office was asked to provide a summary report on what the effect of Plan Colombia has been. And this was only a few months ago, asked for by Vice President Biden, then- Senator Biden, had commissioned the report. And the results are plain. It has had virtually no effect. It seems as though heroin production is down, but cocaine production is up. And so you see the familiar Whack-a-Mole problem of the drug trade, which is that you push something down and something else pops up. And the two most common substitutions you see are the kind of drug, so you go from heroin to cocaine, and the place that these come from. You push it out of the Caribbean, you—it goes into Panama, you push it out of Panama it goes into Colombia, you push it out of Colombia, it goes to Mexico. And thus Mexico has to be seen as the last of a long line of these battles, in America’s war on drugs. And so in that sense you have to ask yourself, are we not in some way responsible for it? Well here’s the simple reality. We are the largest consumer of drugs in the world. We have the most demand in the world. And we also have the largest supply of weaponry in the world. 2,000 guns cross the American border every day to go into Mexico. Hillary Clinton has pointed out that we are arming the Mexican gangsters who operate the drug trade. President Obama has pointed out that 90 percent of the weapons that are found in Mexico can be traced back to the United States. There has been some contestation over the statistics… Fox News says it’s only 17 percent, Factcheck.org says it’s probably higher than 36 percent, but maybe not quite as high as 90 percent. Let me give you a simple statistic. The United States has 280 million guns. 50 percent of all gun production every year is bought in the United States. There are 80 million registered gun users in the United States. There are 2,500 in Mexico. I think we may have something to do with this problem. So if you accept my proposition that the supply of weapons is coming from one place and the demand for drugs is coming from one place, it seems self-evident that we are responsible. You will hear many convincing arguments by honorable people on that side. Honorable opponents of the Mexican government like Mr. Castañeda who ran against President Calderón. Asa Hutchinson who ran the Drug Enforcement Agency. But remember one thing. The only question we are asking you is are we in some way responsible. Let us not one more time shirk our responsibility, and accept that the United States, as the leading consumer of drugs, and the leading supplier of weapons, has got to be partly or substantially to blame for this. Mexico is the latest battle—in America’s drug war"

    "data":"Thank you, and seriously, I did have occasion to head up the Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA, and there’s one thing I learned, Fareed, very quickly as head of the DEA, that when you made a speech somewhere you had a way of drawing protesters. And particularly if you debated drug policy in San Francisco, so I am delighted that this audience is a little bit more friendly. And the other thing I learned that as a dad of a teenaged daughter, that being head of the DEA was a good way to drive away boyfriends that you didn’t want calling on your daughter. So, there are a few advantages to that. I am here today, on this debate topic because I believe it is critically important to the national security of the United States. I believe what happens in Mexico is critically important to that country, but I also believe that what happens in the overall fight against illegal drugs is important for this generation and the next of Americans. And I would agree with Fareed that we do have responsibilities, as United States citizens to reduce the demand for drugs in our country. There is a responsibility but ladies and gentlemen, I’ve noticed something thus far today, and they’re trying to change the proposition. The proposition is not that the United States shares some responsibility. The proposition is that America is to blame. And I believe there’s a distinction between blame and responsibility, or joint responsibility, or some responsibility. And “blame” is a heavy word, that implies that we as a government of the United States are doing something wrong. I agree that we have responsibility but it’s a shared responsibility. Drug consumption is not unique to the United States. I met with Vincente Fox in Mexico City. And I was there as Under-Secretary at Homeland Security but he didn’t want to talk about that subject with Secretary Ridge, he turned to me and said Asa, you were head of the DEA, we’ve got a problem in Mexico with drug consumption and addiction that we need to do something about. He was talking about Mexicans, and he’s talking about the challenges of drugs in his society. And that is across the globe that there is that problem. And…to respond to Fareed about where we are in our fight against drugs today, we should be reminded of some of our successes. Ladies and gentlemen, since the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, when we initiated strong effort against the fight against drugs, we have reduced overall drug consumption in the United States by 50 percent. Please remember that statistic, you can go on monitoring the future websites, a consistent poll and survey that’s done, as well as SAMHSA’s survey…overall drug use has declined 50 percent in our country, cocaine use has declined 75 percent, since the height of the drug problems in the ‘70s, and in the ‘80s. Ladies and gentlemen, that is progress that represents saved lives. Now let me move quickly to why the Mexican drug war, the United States is not to blame for Mexico’s drug war. And the first answer is that Mexico has allowed itself to be a major transit and source country. They are a transit country obviously for drugs but the source drugs that come from Mexico, heroin, marijuana that they grow in the hills, as well as methamphetamine that they produce, they’re sources of that, and they as a sovereign country have allowed themselves to be in that predicament. Secondly, Mexico has resisted US help. This is important to put this in the context of history. In the 1980s, as Fareed pointed out, two thirds of our illegal drugs in the United States came through the Caribbean basin into Miami. We had Miami Vice, we slowed it down in the Caribbean basin, but they moved toward other avenues to bring it in, and that being Mexico and today 90 percent of the cocaine comes through Mexico. How did this happen. It’s because Mexico did not shoulder the burden to say we want to resist in our country, it is a long historic problem that goes back to the ‘80s, decades, it’s not something that’s just happened in the last three years. A key event happened. In February of 1985, Kiki Camarena, a wonderful DEA agent, was captured in Guadalajara, brutally beaten, tortured, and murdered. It was a seminal event in our relations. As a result of that there was a massive manhunt for the perpetrators of that. Mexico believed that we were infringing upon their sovereignty. And therefore, they resisted any US assistance after that event in 1985, in fact in 1986 the Foreign Minister of Mexico said, that “the activities of the DEA trample our sovereignty.” And ladies and gentlemen, I am here today respecting fully the government of Mexico for their sovereignty, but they have made their own decisions, as we have made our decisions and they are a responsible nation and they would not want to blame the United States of America, they are the ones that resisted our assistance during that time. President Calderón has most recently reinvigorated this fight against the drug-trafficking organizations in Mexico. But whose decision was it to move from, you’re infringing upon our sovereignty, in the ‘80s, and DEA get out, we don’t want to have anything to do with you, to the partnership that President Calderón wants to have. It was a sovereign decision by the leader of Mexico that said we’re going to go to war against the drug cartels. That decision should not be blamed on the United States of America, it was a Mexican decision. And then fourthly, it is very important to understand, that the culture of corruption that has developed in Mexico, the failure of the rule of law in Mexico, is one of the largest contributing factors to the violence that we see today. And, I was on the Crime Subcommittee. I asked a question of a cartel member who was brought there to testify. I said what is the greatest weapon that you fear in the United States arsenal, or in the law enforcement arsenal. The answer came back very quickly, we fear extradition. And why is that. They did not fear law enforcement in Mexico or in Central America. It was extradition to the United States of America, you cannot have a failure of the rule of law, and be successful in the fight against drugs. The cartels have operated with impunity, and that is not the fault of the United States. The United States is not at fault for the historic problems in Mexico, we are not to blame for what has happened."

    "data":"Thank you very much, it’s very nice to be here, see so many people interested in this topic. Let me start by responding very briefly to a few of things that Mr. Hutchinson said. He said that in fact there’s evidence that the war on drugs has been effective in reducing drug use, as he mentioned that’s not really on point, that’s not really the question. But it’s also not correct. There’s tons of evidence, and I’m responsible for some of that evidence in my academic writing, on whether attempts to reduce consumption of drugs with prohibition are effective, and it universally finds little if any effect. Yes, you can cherry-pick certain statistics to find that in some periods drug use went down, okay, but in other periods it’s gone up, or some other kind of drug use went up, the overall result is clearly no evidence for the efficacy of prohibition. And note that over the last 40 years, we have dramatically ramped up our efforts to enforce prohibition, so we should have seen some effects if those effects were in any way going to be effective. Now turning to the proposition itself. Is America to blame for Mexico’s drug wars. The answer is indisputably yes. I want to argue it in three steps. First, there’s a fact already mentioned, that the US consumes a lot of drugs produced or trans-shipped through Mexico. No one disputes that and that’s clearly a part of the issue, but it’s not the whole issue, and it’s not the most important part of the issue, why, well…one, there’s not really anything we can do about the fact that the US consumers choose to consume drugs. Other countries consume some of the drugs from Mexico including Mexicans, including Canada or Europe, et cetera. But it is a piece of the story and it is one sense in which you might say that the proposition that America is to blame, is correct. But there’s a much, much more important sense. Why are there drug wars in Mexico. Why is there violence in the drug trade in the US, and many other countries. The reason there are drug wars is because the drug trade is prohibited. Whether you think drugs should be legal or not, it’s an indisputable fact, based on theory and evidence, that when you drive a market underground, it becomes violent. Why does it become violent? Because participants in an underground market cannot resolve their disputes with courts, with lawyers, by complaining to the Consumer Product Safety Commission or things like that. They can only resolve their disputes by shooting each other or by threatening to shoot each other. We see evidence of this from all over history and all over the world. The US alcohol industry was not violent before 1920, when we passed alcohol prohibition. It was then dramatically violent for 14 years, until we repealed alcohol prohibition, and then the trade became perfectly nonviolent just like any other legal good. If we look at the history of prohibition of drugs, that trade was not violent until we prohibited drugs, and ramped up and escalated the war on drugs. If you look at other commodities from gambling to prostitution to blue jeans supplied in controlled economies where they were in short supply, to commodities driven underground by high tax rates, whenever you drive a market underground, that market becomes violent because participants resolve their disputes with violence, okay, completely independent of the characteristics of the good, whether you’re in favor or not of prohibiting that good, it’s just a fact of nature that the prohibition creates the violence. Now the second thing to recognize is that the US, far and away above any other country, has historically and repeatedly and persistently been the country that has foisted prohibition on the entire world. Starting in 1919, in Paris, at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles which ended World War I, the US said it would not sign unless there was a clause in the treaty that required every other country to immediately go back and adopt drug prohibition. This is in 1919. Throughout the history of the United Nations the US has made fighting drugs and prohibiting drugs in particular a key part of the UN’s mission. And very recently, the US has actively tried to push Canada, England, other countries, and in particular Mexico, to enforce drug prohibition and to adopt drug laws that we approve of. Let me read you some quotes that suggest someone else thinks this is right as well. “While every Mexican administration since the ‘60s has piously declared that it intended to intensify its drug enforcement efforts for domestic motivations, the fact is that the real reason has always been American pressure.” Okay? Quote one. Quote two. “All this starts to show why current US drug policy would have to change in order for Mexico to change its stance. It also explains why it is virtually impossible for Mexico to follow a different policy unilaterally.” Okay? So who wrote those words, suggesting that the US policy, the US insistence, the US pressure on Mexico, is the crucial factor, in determining Mexico’s drug policy. Well, it turns out it’s one of my opponents, Jorge Castañeda, in an article that I found on the Web a few days ago. So I don’t think that point, that the US has tried very, very hard, not always successfully, but has tried consistently, to make sure every country adopts drug prohibition--that point is just not beyond rational dispute. So, part of the discussion here clearly is about what people think about legalization. I’ll comment on that in a second. But you actually don’t need to take a stand on whether it’s good to have drug legalization or drug prohibition, to take a view on the motion. You should be in favor of the motion because it’s just a matter of science and the evidence, that the US pressure to enforce prohibition in Mexico and the US prohibition in the US, are the reasons for the drug violence. Now some people may argue that violence is a cost of doing something that’s worthwhile. They may argue that prohibition reduces drug use, they may argue that drug prohibition has some other moral statement or something like that. Many other people including me would argue that prohibition mainly does bad things, not only the violence but the corruption, the restrictions on medicinal uses of drugs for people who are suffering, the infringements on civil liberties and on and on. Okay, and so you would think that for lots of reasons legalization is the right policy. But you don’t have to take a stand on that, regardless of your views on that, the correct position about the motion is that the US is indeed the single factor to blame for Mexico’s drug wars. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Thank you. Look, we can all agree that Mexico’s violent drug war is destroying innocent lives on both sides of the border. But some have suggested tonight that lax US gun laws or the lack of enough anti-gun laws are somehow to blame for this crisis. Thank you. Look, we can all agree that Mexico’s violent drug war is destroying innocent lives on both sides of the border. But some have suggested tonight that lax US gun laws or the lack of enough anti-gun laws are somehow to blame for this crisis. for a change. One that you just heard tonight was how 90 percent of the guns that are used by the drug cartels, come from the United States. Well, and not from CNN but after independent fact-checking organizations looked into it, it turned out the number wasn’t 90 percent. It wasn’t even close but Fareed, the question shouldn’t be how many guns, whether it’s 1 percent or 100 percent the question should be, well how can we reduce that number. That should be the question before us and the question is, well, maybe we can make smuggling guns into Mexico illegal, but the problem is we’ve already made it illegal. It’s illegal on both sides of the border, and you can’t really make something any more illegal than it already is. So let’s be absolutely clear. If you’re smuggling drugs, or running guns or doing anything illegal with a gun, whether it’s in Mexico City or New York City, you oughta be arrested, prosecuted, and thrown in jail. I think that’s something we can all agree with. No one more so than the National Rifle Association. Because these armed criminals don’t just endanger our families, they endanger our freedoms. And that’s why the NRA’s worked to pass meaningful laws, so if you misuse a gun in the commission of a crime, you’re going to go to jail. Let me mention just a few that we’ve worked on. If you give or even lend a gun to someone that you even think isn’t allowed to have one, you can go to jail for 10 years. If you’re arrested for dealing drugs and carrying a gun in this country, your sentence starts at five years, and that’s just for the gun. Pull the trigger, 10 years. If you shoot someone, you can go to jail for life or get the death penalty. And that’s not three strikes and you’re out, that’s one strike and you’re out. I challenge anyone to look at me with a straight face and say we could end the drug war in Mexico if we just pass one more gun law in the United States. It’s absurd, it won’t work, so let’s stop pretending that it will. Ask yourself. If American criminals don’t obey American gun laws, and Mexican criminals don’t obey Mexican gun laws, how is it that some new gun control law here in the United States is suddenly going to be obeyed by both. It’s not. Look, if you get caught trying to smuggle a gun into Mexico, you’re going to a US jail for a long time. And if you get caught on the Mexican side of the border, you could go to a Mexican jail for even longer. That is unless you can afford to make a donation to the Arresting Officer Scholarship Fund, which to these drug cartels, is nothing more than a small tax on doing business. So let’s not dance around the truth. The truth is they pump about $40 billion worth of product into our country. And it’s not just drugs. This is a sophisticated criminal enterprise, that seems to be involved in child prostitution, money laundering, trafficking of pirated DVD’s, it’s a sophisticated enterprise. So it’s no wonder, they post profits of somewhere between 14 and $25 billion every year. That’s more profit than Microsoft makes. With that kind of money they’re buying whoever they want, whatever they want, wherever it is, no matter what it costs. Judging from the weapons that are seized, we know what they want. Fully automatic machine guns, RPG’s, hand grenades, armored personnel carriers, everything from airplanes to boats. Now intelligence sources say that this type of weaponry comes from the international black market. Places like China and Guatemala. But I gotta tell you the one place it doesn’t come from, are American gun shows or some mom-and-pop gun store in Texas or Arizona, ‘cause you can’t buy fully automatic weapons there, and you sure as hell can’t buy hand grenades, RPG’s and helicopter gunships. But there is another place that it’s available. The Mexican government. According to the New York Times, in the last seven years, more than 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army. Now how many people here think that all 100,000 turned their guns in before they betrayed their country. It’s ridiculous. Most of them were Special Forces, former Special Forces commandos or many of them went on to form their own drug cartel, the Zetas. Which our government says is the most sophisticated, technologically advanced, and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico. And the number-one organization responsible for most of the narcotic-related homicides, beheadings, kidnappings and extortions that take place in Mexico. But it’s not just the military. The cartels are working with the current administration as well. Last year more than a dozen ranking or former officials of the Calderón administration, were arrested for passing tips on to the drug traffickers. One of them, Mexico’s former drug czar. So if you want to talk seriously about this drug war, you’ve gotta talk seriously about the undeniable, institutionalized level of corruption, within the Mexican government. We need to stop talking around the issues, we’ve got enough laws. Everything the drug cartels are doing is already illegal, a hundred different ways on both sides of the border. We don’t need more laws, we’ve got all the tools we need. We’ve got the know-how, we’ve got the tools, the intelligence. What’s lacking is the guts, the political backbone to look each other in truth, and have an honest discussion about this issue. Instead of talking around the issues with some superficial discussion about how gun laws, which are going to continue to be ignored by criminals, could somehow make the difference. Nothing—and until we do that, nothing’s going to change and people on both sides of the border, will continue to pay the price with their lives. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you. First off I want to make clear that I understand that some of Professor Castañeda’s students are in the auditorium. And I think it’s very important to reiterate and remind you that your vote is secret at the end of this, so—Your grades will not be affected by coming to the right side here. And I want to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation for holding this debate. As John mentioned, I grew up in Mexico in the 1970s, in the northern state of Chihuahua, and the capitol city of the same name. And back then it was a pretty easygoing mid-size city. My friends and I wouldn’t really think twice about hitchhiking home from school, or hopping on a city bus to go downtown to watch a movie, then grab a taco at our favorite hole-in-the-wall joint,. Our parents didn’t really worry much about us then. I don’t mean to suggest that Chihuahua was Denmark. The state does sit on the border with the United States. And while the bulk of the hard drug trade in those days as Fareed mentioned, went through the Caribbean, there were plenty of trafficking organizations in the mountains of Chihuahua near the city. But we weren’t really aware of this, there was no violence, I didn’t even know anyone who did drugs. I got my first exposure to the consumer end of the pipeline when I came to school in the States. And it’s actually important to make clear that, contrary to something that was suggested earlier, consumption rates in Mexico still remain very low and that’s something we can explore later in the debate. The state of Chihuahua only became a bloody battleground, its border city of Ciudad Juarez synonymous practically with murder, after the US clamped down on the Caribbean routes via Miami once favored by the cartels. And that is what transformed Mexico into the global hub of the trade for drugs. I was talking to a childhood friend recently in Chihuahua and he told me that the city bears little resemblance to the place that we grew up in, and that he doesn’t dare now leave his kids out of sight. Lest they be kidnapped or caught in the crossfire between the cartels, or between the cartels and the security forces. I am proud I grew up in Mexico, and I’m even more proud to be an American. Which is why it’s doubly painful for me to acknowledge that America is responsible for what’s happened to Chihuahua, and that America is to blame for Mexico’s drug war. The United States cannot continue to have it both ways. We Americans need to make a choice. Either we get serious about clamping down on the consumption of illegal drugs, or we should legalize them. Wherever you come down on the moral health, economic merits of criminalizing versus legalizing drugs, please acknowledge that a continuation of the hypocritical status quo, which criminalizes socially accepted behavior, undermines the rule of law, both in our country, and in countries overrun by the goons who arbitrage between our supposed morality, and our actual behavior. That may all sound a bit abstract. What’s a little erosion of the rule of law between friends. Until you start counting the corpses piling up south of the border. They are closing in on 15,000 just since President Calderón took office in late 2006. And that’s nearly three times the number of US servicemen killed in Iraq and Afghanistan this decade. So let’s not be distracted by talk of corruption in Mexico or what percentage of guns in Mexico comes from where. Our debate isn’t about whether Mexico is like Denmark, or about America’s gun laws. It is about what happens to a nation that shares a 2,000-mile border with the richest nation on earth when that richest nation on earth insists on consuming some $65 billion worth of drugs a year, and insists on ceding control of that market, of that industry, to offshore criminal organizations. There’s an old saying in Mexico, perhaps you’ve heard it. “Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the United States.” But the real curse isn’t merely proximity to America. It’s being sandwiched between America’s insatiable demand for illicit drugs, and the sources of the most valuable of those drugs, the coca fields in Colombia and Bolivia. So let’s not be confused. Whatever Mexico’s shortcomings are, and there are plenty…and say Canada’s virtues, whatever those are— If our two neighboring countries…traded places, we’d be here talking about a Canadian war tonight. Geography sometimes is destiny. As Americans we believe in individual empowerment and the concept that our actions have consequences. As consumers we may shun products that harm the environment, maybe you buy fair-trade coffee. You know, we believe that our choices have consequences. On college campuses students have long thought globally but acted locally. You know, they mobilize against overseas sweatshops… Or they press institutions to divest from investments that may harm people in Darfur or elsewhere. When I was in college in the States, the issue of the day was divestment from South Africa. Activists erected shantytowns on campus to pressure the college to stop investing in companies that were doing business there. Again, a laudable impulse. But even then I was struck by how some of these activists disregarded their socially responsible investment creed, when it came to recreational drugs. Their cash after all was underwriting the murder of elected officials, judges, and policemen in Colombia. As Fareed said back then that was the hub, and now it’s shifted to Mexico. And I do worry that we still haven’t made that connection. I actually shared this view with a girlfriend at the time in college, as an argument for our not indulging, and that may have hastened the demise of our relationship. She didn’t quite call me Buzzkill Martinez but maybe she did and I’ve omitted that memory.I must say though, President Obama to his credit has acknowledged this nexus. Saying that as the ultimate consumers of the drugs flowing north, we have a shared responsibility with Mexico in confronting its war. So we should count him as a member of our team here tonight. And even Ronald Reagan back in 1988 meeting with President de la Madrid said similar things, that the solution to the problem was for Americans to quit buying illegal drugs. And I would suggest another option, as has been suggested, is decriminalization. But we can’t continue to have it both ways. I recently read a best-selling book in Mexico by an author I respect a great deal, and from whom I’ve learned a lot. And on page 85 of that book, he wrote that the US wants Mexico… “to wage the war and provide the corpses, so it doesn’t have to.” And he refers to the US as exporting its internal conflict on drugs. The author of this book, and I’m sorry, Jorge, to pile on, but You’re such prolific writer. The book is excellent. Is Jorge Castañeda of course, and, there’s still time, Jorge, for you to switch sides and come over to—to join us and Presidents Obama and Reagan. But I look forward to continuing this conversation, and thank you so much for your interest."

    "data":"Very quickly first for my students, in Mexico we have ways of knowing how you vote. Be careful. Secondly, this is a tilted playing field. Because on that side, I have two of my current and former bosses and that’s not fair. Andrés Martinez is my boss at the New America Foundation, and Fareed had been my boss at Newsweek magazine for a long, long period of time. So obviously, you know, I feel somewhat constrained. My point is very simple here. The United States is not to blame for Mexico’s drug war, Mexico is not to blame for Mexico’s drug war, President Felipe Calderón is to blame for Mexico’s drug war, a war of choice that he should not have declared, that cannot be won, and is doing enormous damage to Mexico. It was started on false premises, that Mexican consumption had grown by 2006 which is false according to the government’s own health statistics. Not only has Mexican consumption not grown, it is lower than the consumption not only of the United States and Western Europe, but of practically all of Latin America. It was premised on an increase in violence in Mexico through 2006, which is also false. Willful homicides had been decreasing Mexico, for the previous 15 years, down to levels way below those of Central America, Brazil, Colombia, et cetera, though still higher than the United States. Thirdly, it was premised on a loss of state capacity to enforce the law in Mexico, from what you’ve heard here and quite rightly on both sides of the table, that state capacity in Mexico has never been immense, and it’s not necessarily worse today than it was before. Yes, there is corruption in Mexico, the point is there is more corruption today than there was 20, 25 years ago. I say no there isn’t. And finally, this was also a war that was predicated on the issue, that there was a current explosion of war, which had to be stopped, it cannot be stopped. Why did President Calderón declare this war of choice? Because he felt that he needed to legitimize himself in the view of the Mexican people, because his election was questioned. Fareed, I’m sorry on this point, I tried to run against President— Candidate Calderón, and wasn’t allowed to, and supported him actively, and wrote in many of the places I wrote and that you all quote, that I actively supported, called on readers to vote for him, supported him actively, during the campaign, during the election, and during the post-election discussion on whether the election was free and fair, which I thought it was. I thought he won, most Mexicans thought he won, but he decided that he had to legitimize himself in the eyes of the Mexican people for a questioned election. And he thought that this was the way to do it, by calling the Army out into the streets, donning a military uniform for the first time in 50 years of Mexican history, and trying to achieve, through the war on drugs, what he could have achieved in a much more useful way. This war cannot be won, simply because it is failing to comply with the fundamental tenets of a very good friend of mine, that some of you may know, Colin Powell’s view of the first Gulf War. To go into war like this, you need to have overwhelming force, we don’t have it. You need to have a definition of victory, we don’t have it. You need to have an exit strategy, we don’t have it. And you should have the support of the Mexican people in this case, which President Calderón does have, but he’s running out of it very quickly. Is the US to blame for this? I tend to think it’s not directly to blame, although there is a case to be made for the consumption and arms argument. The problem with the consumption argument, is that if the United States is going to reduce consumption significantly, well, it’s time to do so. And frankly that doesn’t seem to be what American society wants to do. I don’t see the United States wanting to reduce American consumption or demand. Frankly, if I was an American citizen and was asked to vote on this question, I would vote against reducing US consumption. Why bother? There’re much more intelligent things to do with US consumption, I believe, than trying to reduce it. For example, legalize or decriminalize the consumption of as many drugs as is reasonable right now. Start with what you can, see what happens, and then move forward. Is there an alternative issue—approach, of course there is. We don’t have to proceed the way President Calderón has, we don’t have to proceed the way both the Bush and Obama administration, who on this point, are exactly identical in their policy toward Mexico… We don’t have to proceed the way Calderón has proceeded and the way Bush and Obama have supported him. We don’t have to declare a war on all the cartels all the time as Carlos Fuentes has said. We can do either what the Colombians did, combat collateral damages. We can pursue a policy of harm reduction in Mexico. And we can pursue a policy in the United States, Mexicans, we Mexicans, of trying to lobby in the United States in favor of decriminalization where it can be done. But we certainly don’t have to go to war with more than 15,000 people already killed in drug-related killings, and the number rising every week, every month, every year. We have far more executions today in Mexico, than we had four years ago. But the last point I want to make is the most absurd one. We have tens of people dying every day in Tijuana. On the border, with the United States. Sometimes, 50, 60, 70. And, they are there basically dying to stop Mexican marijuana, among other drugs, from entering the United States. The small problem is that 120 miles north of Tijuana, in Los Angeles, there are more public, legal dispensaries of medical marijuana than public schools. There are more than a thousand medical dispensaries of marijuana in Los Angeles, perfectly legal. So we have our guys dying south of the border, to stop the marijuana from entering the United States, and being sold legally in Los Angeles. I think there’s something fundamentally wrong with that idea, it doesn’t work, it’s a war that cannot be won, it’s a war that should not have been waged, and it’s a war that we should call off promptly. The United States is not to blame for it, Mexico is not to blame for it, it’s a war of choice that President Calderón declared for strictly political reasons, thank you."

    "data":"Thank you. Thank you, thank you all, and thank you to the Rosenkranz Foundation for their important work in making civil conversation really a reality in which we can all participate. Like to tell you a little story to begin. Uh, about two months after I started work at the White House in two—2001, there was a rap on the door, not a midnight rap, a daytime rap. Uh, my wife, um, went to answer the door, um, and there on the step was an agent of the FBI. Uh, showed her his badge, and asked if he might come in and ask a few questions. Our neigh—next-door neighbor, he told her, had just, uh, been hired into a sensitive position in the federal government, and as part of the security check on the next-door neighbor he wanted to ask a few questions. So he asked my wife, uh, had we noticed anything unusual about them, did they seem to be living within their means, uh, did they, uh, conduct themselves responsibly and respectably in the neighborhood and— She was a little embarrassed because these were new neighbors, we did not know them well but to the best of her ability she gave ‘em a clean bill of health. But jogged by this, she said, you know, we haven’t had them over, we really should. So— So she invited the next-door neighbors over a few weeks later and they came and we poured tea and gave them cake and eventually my wife congratulated, um, them on, on the husband’s new job with the federal government. He said, what are you talking about, he said I’m—I’m still at Sibley and Austin, I’ve always been at Sibley and Austin. And what we realized, was, that the FBI had meant to come to their house…  to ask them about me. Tonight’s motion, is “Better—better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11,” and the question is, more than what? And my answer is, more than that. Now, none of us are here to argue, none of us are here to argue for limitless domestic surveillance. Um, the three of us on the affirmative side of this debate have a deep and abiding commitment to privacy and liberty. Um, my colleague, Andy McCarthy, has been a federal prosecutor, his job is to defend and uphold the US Constitution, the greatest liberty-affirming document in world history. My colleague John Yoo, was on the front line to defend all—all of our liberties, and liberties of people all over the world, against, uh, totalitarian conspiracy. Not only that but in our private lives, Andy McCarthy is a conservative in New York, and John Yoo is a conservative at Berkeley, California. We understand, believe me, in the most intimate possible way, the importance of free thought, free expression, privacy, and the ability of human beings to speak their mind in debate and conversation, without fear of punishment or consequence or an overbearing state. But…here’s the question for today. Should we have more surveillance than we had when those FBI agents were knocking on the wrong door…at, uh, a level of surveillance that made possible the tremendous catastrophe we know as 9/11, or should we continue with the path we’ve been following since 9/11, toward, not a police state, not a nightmare regime in which you have no privacy. Is anyone in this room as a concrete matter afraid to speak his or her mind? I very much doubt it. But, um… That’s just because your listeners are so cranky. Uh…we, we are here— Uh, we are here to uphold…a new level of surveillance, that is, uh, that is not made up of new techniques, it is made up of very familiar and traditional techniques, as my partners will argue, that is not onerous, that is not burdensome, that leaves all legitimate freedoms and privacies intact, and that is abundantly worth it, and in fact has proven over the past halfdecade, has proven in the acid test of experience its merit. You know, 9/11 is beginning to be a little while ago. But the recent terrible events of—at Virginia Tech, um, Technical institute—the, the Virginia Tech University, remind us, remind us of the reality of danger and fear, uh, of—that we all experienced in those terrible days. Now if we cast our minds back, back to that time, I think many of us will remember, we expected more of the same. We dreaded more of the same. And that was one of the reasons that, uh, the—the sniper attacks in Washington were able to paralyze a great city. Because we were ready for something dreadful, something even more dreadful. And on American soil, it has not happened. But that does not mean that the threat is not real, in fact, if you sound the roll of world events since 9/11, you will be reminded how very, very real it is. In December of 2001, gunmen attacked the Indian parliament, and, uh, attempted— well, hoped, hoped to kill in fact very senior officials in the Indian government. They did kill a number of parliamentarians and some ci—uh, civil servants, and some security guards, and very nearly succeeded in triggering a nuclear war, between India and Pakistan. We remember the bombing in Bali, uh, whi—which took so many lives of, uh, Indonesians and Australians, and others who were, who were visiting that, that beautiful place. The Madrid Atocha railway station bombings. The bombings in London in 2005. Just this past year in 2006, attempted bombings, very serious attempted bombings, in Toronto, and in Germany, and tragically a successful bombing in Bombay, successful of course from the point of view of the terrorists. These—the, the threat, the threat of mass-casualty terrorism, um, at the hands of people guided by a totalitarian ideology, remains a real threat. But here’s the good news. What we notice as we look back on this half-decade of terrible atrocities, is a dwindling level of sophistication, behind each of these attacks. Uh, that the Atocha attack was much less sophisticated than the 9/11 attack, the London attack in 2005, less sophisticated than Atocha, and the attacks attempted this past summer were less sophisticated than those of 2005. The terrorists are finding it harder to coordinate, they’re finding it harder to communicate with each other, they are under crushing international pressure. Now…one of the ironies about this is, we don’t…entirely understand how this is happening, even inside our own law enforcement agencies. Here’s one way to think about how a terrorist attack proceeds. If any—if any of you have been in a toy store recently I’m sure you’ve seen those toys, where you drop a ball bearing, uh, through, uh, into a little slot and it whizzes and rolls and it catches the little teeter-totter and it goes through a basketball hoop, and it proceeds over many, uh, feet of track until finally it emerges out the other end. And there are a series all along the way of little switching points, and that’s the game, to watch the ball jump and hop and skip and move past these various obstacles. Think of a terrorist plot as like that ball bearing. It starts, and it rolls and it unfurls. And it has to pass— pass through a number of switching points. If you can make each of those points just slightly more difficult, you stop the plot in just the way the earth’s atmosphere stops the meteorites, without any of us ever being aware of it. It is that level of in—of in—of intensified surveillance of illegitimate activities, that has complicated the life of the terrorist, not—and has not made terrorism impossible, has not in any way lessened their desire to do people harm, but that has made—that has broken up their ability to communicate with one another, that has made it more difficult for them to move money, and has made it much more difficult to strike, and especially to strike inside the United States. You know, all of us here, are people—are, um, are people who love liberty. Who prize liberty, and who use liberty, as we are using it tonight. But we are also citizens of great cities in the Western world. And we are all potential casualties of attack. And the liberties we are using are the very thing, the very thing that inflames and provokes those who would attack us."

    "data":"I promise…not to use the example that David gave us, of how easy it is for the FBI to screw up something as simple…as interviewing the right person for a federal job, security clearance… as, as clear an example of why we should not entrust yet additional secret surveillance powers to the government, I promise not to make such an example. Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11? I don’t know how to put it quite delicately enough, and not just no but hell no. The government doesn’t need it…the government has shown it doesn’t deserve it...the government has not justified it, the government will abuse additional domestic surveillance power, as sure as we are sitting here this evening. And the people of this great land, and those who lawfully visit this country as well, cannot afford it. Now why can’t we afford it. Many of us here, many of you all may be here this evening, because you have a particular privacy concern. A particular category of information, that you believe ought to be, or, continue to be, private, from government snooping. From government surveillance. Or, you may not have a particular category of such information yourself, but others might, and you support them, in maintaining the secrecy, the privacy, the privilege, of maintaining that information for themselves. But I suspect that deep down, at least most of us are here this evening, because we understand that privacy is more than simply the sum total of individual aspects of information that we wanna retain private. Ayn Rand, that great philosopher, who just two years ago I believe it was we celebrated centennial of her birth…and that great proponent of freedom, put it perhaps best, when she wrote, in 1943, in the middle of World War II, in The Fountainhead, that “privacy is the essence of civilization itself. Yes, it is that important. Civilization is the march of mankind…toward a realization and an acceptance of and a protection of, the basic right to privacy.” I think our founding fathers understood that, when they crafted the Bill of Rights. They didn’t feel the need to mention, in each one of those, this is a privacy right. But just look at them, and you see the importance of privacy, embodied in… the foundation of the First Amendment. Were it not based on a notion that we have a right to the privacy, of our religious, political views for example, there’d be no reason to have the First Amendment. The Second Amendment…so much in the news these days, also is founded in essence on the notion of privacy. If we, as preachers of God, did not enjoy the inherent right to the privacy of our being, of our property, then there would be no reason to have a Second Amendment which is designed to implement the protection of those ideas, those properties, those persons. The right to the privacy, the right to have your ideas, your privacy, your property, your person free from unwarranted government intrusion is indeed the essence of civilization. That’s why it’s so important that we address this issue. The question, “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11”…look at what we’re talking about here, we’re not talking about the legitimate function of government in a national security context…to gather intelligence on foreigners, foreign intelligence. What we’re talking about is our government surveilling us. And they ought to be held, and the Fourth Amendment requires them to be held, to a very high burden. Why? Because our founding fathers recognized…that if we allowed the government to intrude into our lives, other than in those areas where it has an articulable, legitimate need to pierce that sphere of privacy that surrounds each one of us, if we allow that, then we are not free. Think back. This question also talks about another 9/11. Fear, of course the driving force for virtually every effort by the federal government and indeed by state and local governments, since 9/11, to justify whatever expanded government power it is that they seek. We’re talking about another 9/11. Well, let’s think about 9/11. Did 9/11 happen, did those awful… terrorists succeed on 9/11 in this very city, and in our nation’s capital, and in that field in Pennsylvania, did they succeed because the government was not able to increase its surveillance of…those of us in this country, no. Those terrorists succeeded because of a series of tragic… mistakes and blunders by government. Our government didn’t use the tools that were already available to it. It could’ve stopped those terrorists at any number of points along their horrible journey. There were laws, repetitive laws, on the books, at the federal and the state level, to have stopped them from gaining access to the information that they needed. From gaining access to—access to the tools whereby car—they carried out…their horrible deeds. It wasn’t because the government lacked…sufficient power to surveil Americans. It is a false premise. And what has the government done since then, and what is it even doing now. I guarantee you, if this question, “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11,” is answered by the American people, not just here this evening, but writ large…then you will never, ever see the end of government surveillance power. Sort of like being a divorce lawyer, something I do not do. No matter how much you concede to the other side——they always want more.  So it is with domestic surveillance. Even today, this administration, which has violated the laws limiting…its ability to conduct domestic surveillance, it wishes and is seeking legislation to gain even more access to our private lives, and, get this. The final irony. To grant immunity for past violations of the law. Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11, not on your life. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you very much. Um, pleasure to be here this evening. My, uh, FBI story is a little bit different from David’s. It’s more along the lines of what the FBI was up against. My brother, who lived in the Bronx, was applying for a job with the FBI, uh, and the knock we got on the door was from one of the neighbors who told him that the Feds had been by, but not to worry – he didn’t tell ‘em nothing. Um, that, of course, was back in the 1990s, uh, before there ever was a, uh, George W. Bush Administration to bash. Uh, and during that time the United States managed to stop exactly one terrorist attack by something other than dumb luck. That was the spring 1993 Jihadist conspiracy against New York City landmarks, right here in Manhattan. How did we stop it? The FBI had a confidential informant who infiltrated the conspiracy. Now, think for a moment about how intrusive that is. Our government sent a man right out into radical mosques to meet with worshipers. All of them were Muslims. Several of them were American citizens. He prayed among them, he entered their very homes, he tape recorded all of his conversations. And following the government’s instructions, he lied to them about who he was and who he was working for. And he did that precisely to trick them, uh, in order to get them to compromise their most deeply held secrets and plans. And you know what? Neither the Fifth Amendment nor the Fourth Amendment had a thing to say about it. It’s been the law of the United States for decades that such investigative techniques do not implicate our privacy and due process interests. Um, as a result of that there were no court orders for those tactics, no judicial supervision, uh, no supervision of any kind for the most intrusive tactics imaginable. And had those tactics not been used, thousands of New Yorkers would have lost their lives in those attacks. That’s not me conjuring up a nightmare scenario. That’s not me trying to tap into your fear. That’s a case that actually happened, right down here in Manhattan. Uh, it’s the kind of investigating that didn’t happen before 9/11, when nearly three thousand people were killed, and didn’t happen in connection with most of the completed atrocities that were the subjects of the trials that took place in the 1990s. And the Executive Branch, without judicial supervision and without much Congressional oversight to speak of, has intercepted and electronically eavesdropped on enemy communications in every war in the history of the United States since it’s been technologically possible to do so. It’s a simple fact. You cannot get good actionable intelligence, the intelligence that saves lives, without monitoring what people are saying to each other and without watching the bad guys to see who they speak to so that you can map out these organizations. That’s just common sense. The most dangerous conspirators are generally speaking the most insulated conspirators. It takes wiretapping to ferret them out. In the 1930s, uh, the government got Al Capone on tax evasion. That’s all they could come up with. Uh, but in the 1990s the government got John Gotti on about twenty-five homicides. How did they do it? They listened to what he was saying. They bugged his conversations. Today, of course, we’re not talking about Mafia hits. We’re talking about mass murders of our citizens – not just law enforcement but national security. All of our liberties are precious. On that, uh, I think every panelist here is in agreement, as David said before. But none of our liberties is worthy of the name unless we can secure the country. And all our liberties are valuable but none of them is as valuable as the collective right to life that belongs to all of us collectively together in our national community. To protect that right we have to do surveillance. We’re fighting an enemy that does not have a territory to defend. It does not have a treasure that we can destroy them by taking. Our only, only defense is surveillance – finding out who they are, trying to figure out what they might strike next. And stopping them is far more important than prosecuting them. Prosecutions become cold comfort when the death tolls start to climb into the hundreds and the thousands. And we’ve seen that. That’s not a scare tactic. Against such daunting risks privacy interests fretted over by our friends on the other side are frankly trifles. What difference does it make if the government has information that your phone company, your bank and every private, uh, vendor that you deal with, uh, not only has but is warehousing and data mining, targeting you. Uh, but unlike the government, not targeting you so that they can protect you. The government’s ability to access such information may make the difference between life and death. And in the national security context, that access is now subject to various judicial hurdles and Congressional oversight, which our law has never imposed on prosecutors and agents who investigate such insignificant, relatively speaking, crimes as gambling. Common sense tells us that under the current threat this is the kind of investigating that government not only should be able to do but must be able to do. If you don’t think so, ask yourself about the security you willingly subjected yourself to without any court search warrant the last time you got on a plane or entered a public building or tried to carry a bag into Yankee Stadium or even if you’ve had the experience of entering the offices of the American Civil Liberties Union. We had a trial here in New York about a year ago and it came out during the trial that visitors to the ACLU’s New York office, uh, are confronted when they come in with big signs on the wall that say, “Your bags are subject to search.” Why do they do that? It’s a reasonable balancing of our minor, of minor intrusions to protect ourselves and the people we care about. That’s what the Fourth Amendment has always been about – reasonableness. If there’s a valid basis to believe people could be drinking and driving the police can set up sobriety checks and stop motorists randomly. When the police arrest somebody, they’ve always had the ability, uh, to search them to make sure that they’re not armed. If you work in a regulated industry the government can compel you to provide information and even do spot checks. None of this requires a judicial warrant, none of it requires probable cause and there are thousands of searches like this, countless searches, taking place in this country every day, uh, and this has been the case for years and years without any discernable, uh, suggestion that the Constitution has been shredded or that our core freedoms have been jeopardized. The thing all the exceptions I’m talking about have in common, besides being reasonable restraints on our freedom, is that none of them is nearly as important as protecting our national security – the safety of us all collectively. We’ve done a lot of talking about civil liberties these last six years. But the conversations I remember the best, uh, are the ones that I had with, uh, victims of terrorist attacks, like the World Trade Center attack or, uh, the two hundred, uh, mostly Muslim Kenyans and, and the people in the surrounding area, uh, who were, uh, victimized by the bombing of the U.S. embassy in 1998 in Nairobi. The threat we’re facing is not hype. It’s, it’s flesh and blood real. And the fundamental rights of these victims – the vi…the right to life, the right to liberty, the right to pursue happiness – have been stolen from them by our enemies in a way that can never be compensated. Those are our most essential civil liberties and the only way we can protect them is by enduring comparative trifles in order to let the government do the thing that we needed to do, the only thing we really needed to do – uh, which is protect us and save lives. And that’s why you should vote for the motion."

    "data":"No, no, I’m, I, I want my own. That ominous one is an Orwellian, uh, and appropriate note for the evening. Congressman Barr has argued eloquently that more domestic surveillance of American citizens would not have prevented 9/11. I’d like to offer two additional reasons to try to persuade you to argue against the motion, “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11.” Uh, the first has to do with effectiveness. It’s possible to protect privacy and security at the same time. Possible, in other words, to reduce the risk of terrorism without dramatically increasing the surveillance of American citizens. And the second has to do with abuse. Uh, Mr. McCarthy talked about the comparative trifles, the minor incursions on privacy that were necessary since 9/11 to protect us. But in fact, history shows that every time the government has asked for and been granted broader powers of surveillance it has not directed those expanded powers against suspected terrorists but instead has used them to conduct dragnets – ineffective dragnets – that have menaced the privacy of innocent citizens without making us safer. What do I mean when I say that it’s possible to protect privacy and security at the same time? I have in mind the evolution of a surveillance technology that, uh, some of you may have read about – and we can call this the naked machine, because this is more or less what it is. This is the high tech, three dimensional millimeter imaging machine that was initially used at a Florida airport a couple of years ago to, uh, detect contraband. It can identify not only metal, uh, but anything that’s buried under clothing, ceramics or plastic. This is a very effective, uh, X-ray machine. The only downside is that it shows us completely stark naked. Now, the people who designed this machine came up with a simple programming shift. They found that it’s able to maintain the pictures of the ceramics or the plastics and the contraband, but to take the pictures of the naked body and scramble it, uh, scramble the anatomically sensitive regions into a nondescript blob. Now, obviously, this wonderful alternative – the blob machine as opposed to the naked machine – is, for many of us, an act of mercy, uh –especi…especially for those of you this evening who are intellidating. You can in…invite each afterward to co…come by and check out the blob machine – much safer than, uh, the naked machine. Uh, and it’s also a silver bullet technology. It provides just as much security without any threat to privacy. It shows, in fact, that it’s possible to, uh, protect our security without any, as it were, domestic surveillance. Now, I’m convinced that all of the laws and technologies that have been proposed since 9/11 can be designed in ways that look more like the blob machine than the naked machine. And it’s, uh, surely willfulness that has led the other side to resist these well designed laws and technologies, uh, for badly designed ones that menace privacy without making us safer. Let me try to, uh, persuade you by giving an example of the evolution of one of the most controversial and important surveillance programs since 9/11. This is the program that was originally known as total information awareness. In its original incarnation the government proposed to unite a lot of information that’s held by public and private data bases – uh, magazine subscriptions, consumer records, internet browsing – to unite that with public arrest records and then to conduct vast data mining that would try to predict whose travel patterns resemble those of the nineteen, uh, 9/11 terrorists and to stop those people at airports. Now, what was wrong with this system? It wouldn’t have worked and it posed grave threats to privacy. But aside from that, Mrs. Lincoln, it was an excellent system. Why would it have been ineffective? Well, if you imagine that the next attack looks nothing like the last one. It, it takes place, God forbid, on a train rather a plane – then modeling the travel patterns of the 9/11 people will lead to the arrest of a lot of retired businessmen in Florida who take flying lessons but will miss all the real terrorists. And given the huge numbers of false positives, the nation’s airports would be brought to a halt. The second problem is privacy. The comparative trifles that Mr. McCarthy so sneeringly dismissed would have allowed the government to store in a centralized data base all sorts of, uh, records that it could then use to menace its enemies, just as the Nixon Administration did when it went after the tax returns of Vietnam protesters and threatened them with prosecution. Now, the evolution of total information awareness is a positive story and one that, uh, very much supports our side because, uh, because of the opposition of a bipartisan coalition of libertarian conservatives like Congressman Barr and civil libertarian liberals like Professor Strossen. The system was refined. First, the government was prohibited from sharing information with law enforcement agents unless there was evidence of a serious crime or a violent terrorist act, avoiding that kind of discriminatory menacing of political enemies. And second, the government abandoned the foolish idea of trying to predict future attacks based on the patterns of past ones and instead merely confirmed that people are who they say they are at the airports – a more modest goal, the one that makes us safer. What initially began as a naked machine technology evolved into a blob machine one and across the range of laws and technologies we can tell a similar story. So the tradeoff that the other side falsely presents you with need not exist. Now, what about the abuse? Uh, it’s clear that every time the government has been granted new authorities it’s abused them – not to, uh, focus on suspected terrorists but instead to menace innocent citizens. And this is not a surprise because the essence of the Patriot Act, which was not a minor change in American surveillance laws, uh, but a significant one in several respects. The government used to only be able to engage in warrantless searches in secret without notifying the people whose data was being searched if they could prove in advance that the target was a suspected spy or foreign terrorist. But because of the changes in the Patriot Act the government is now able to engage in secret warrantless surveillance of anyone’s data merely by asserting that the data is relevant to a terrorism investigation. Should we be surprised when the FBI, uh, using this new authority issued not a couple of carefully chosen national security letters but, according to the Inspector General’s recent report, a hundred and forty thousand national security letters in the past three years? And according to his report’s most of those letters were not for suspected terrorists but for people who had nothing to do with terrorism. And should we be surprised that that data was not a trifling threat to privacy but was stored in a centralized data base and kept for twenty years? Should we be surprised that people who visited Las Vegas during a false terrorist threat had their hotel records and gambling records stored in that centralized data without their knowledge because of this foolish and misguided program? Or that the FBI, which couldn’t even get David Frum’s address right, was so inept that it didn’t keep records of the national security letters that it issued and therefore didn’t know when it was getting the right or wrong data? How could you possibly trust the government with expanded authority when it used the authority that was given so recklessly? The government’s approach to this, uh, pro…problem is much like that scene out of Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy, where Woody Allen suddenly comes up to Mia Farrow’s window on a flying bicycle and says, Hop on. And she’s sort of skeptical and she says, Um. And he says, Trust me. It’s me, Andrew. Hop on. She’s still skeptical. He says, Trust me anyway.This –is the government’s approach to this problem – Trust me anyway. And we’ve seen too much of their abuse of this power since 9/11 to continue and engage in this trust. So we are saying not that it’s not important to take the terrorist threat seriously but we need meaningful oversight focused on genuine terrorists, which, while protecting the privacy of innocent citizens. We can do that through law, we can do that know…uh, through technology. We have in our hands the ability to protect privacy and security at the same time. What we need now is the will. Thank you very much."

    "data":"I’d like to thank the, uh, Rosenkranz Foundation and Intelligence Squared for giving me the opportunity to escape the People’s Republic of Berkeley and to visit a more conservative city, like New York. I, uh, understand that many of you, according to The Washington Post, are here on dates. I think this is a wonderful idea. Uh, uh, I, uh, it’s really remarkable to me cause the last date I had was in the first Reagan Administration. I do have to say, though, I find it surprising that many people would think that the voice and appearance of Bob Barr would be an aphrodisiac. First, let me, uh, directly engage with Jeff’s point. If there are things that the government can do to increasessecurity without reducing privacy we should have already done them. I think at some point, though -- and I think we’re at that point now – you reach a trade-off. It’s not unusual to security policy. Every government decision involves a tradeoff. When we decide to reduce greenhouse gases by having higher mile per gallons, uh, requirements for cars, we know a certain higher number of people will die on the highways because the cars will be lighter. Government decisions always involve tradeoffs and it’s possible to have tradeoffs that go the wrong way. We have had periods where civil liberties were greater than they are today and we have suffered as a result. So, for example, the wall that many of you may have heard about, which prohibited the FBI and the CIA from pooling their information about terrorist networks is the one thing that the 9/11 Commission found that directly led to the 9/11 attacks. Because we knew the names of two of the 9/11 hijackers inside the country, the agents who worked for the intelligence bureaus were unable to communicate that information to FBI agents inside the country who could tried to locate them because of rules that were set up to protect civil liberties. Similarly, when we have tried to put Al Qaeda members on trial before 9/11 -- and Mr. McCarthy was one of the prosecutors who did that – again, for civil liberties reasons, we turned over massive amounts of information to the defense teams. One of those was a list of all the co-conspirators of one of the Al Qaeda suspects. If you think about it that was a list of every single person at the time we thought was a member of Al Qaeda. That list was found in Africa after the bombings in Yemen, when our agents went out to try to find out who was responsible. I’m not saying that we should go all the way over to security or all the way for civil liberties but there is a balance. And there is a tradeoff. And having more civil liberties can have a cost of security, just as increasing security can have a reduction in civil liberties. Also let me admit that in past wars the government has reduced civil liberties. But I would say, if you place it in historical perspective those reductions of civil liberties are far greater than anything we’re experiencing today. In 1798, the first war we fought as a country, it was made a crime to criticize the government during the war. In the Civil War, President Lincoln, on his own authority, detained thousands of American citizens in military detention without any recourse to civilian court and had many of them tried by military judges. In World War I it was made a crime and people were prosecuted for criticizing the war effort, for arguing that people should not obey the draft. In World War II President Roosevelt detained over a hundred and twenty thousand loyal American citizens. He initiated military courts, some of who, which were used to try American citizens. He ordered the warrantless wiretapping – not just of communications going in and out of the country, but every communication inside the United States –against a clear statute and Supreme Court precedent at the time, over a year and a half before Pearl Harbor. I think, if you compare those measures that have been taken in wartime in American history in the past, the reductions of civil liberties we have today are nowhere near as large of a magnitude. Take, for example, the political system. We have had two Presidential election – well, one Presidential election during, uh, this post-9/11 period. We have had several Congressional elections. Political control of Congress just switched in the last election. We have had outpourings of new political speech through new methods and means. For example, uh, people I wish never existed – bloggers. This did not exist before 9/11. Are we really in such a serious civil liberties crisis if bloggers are able to use this new medium to say, uh, I think, quite incredible things? Take the detention policy that I’m sure, uh, the other side is going to talk about. These are always slippery slope arguments. How many American citizens have actually been detained since 9/11 in military detention? It’s not the thousands or hundreds of thousands from previous wars. By my count, it’s two. How many citizens of other countries in the United States – permanent resident aliens – have been detained as part of the post-9/11 program? Again, it’s not thousands and not hundred thousands. I think, again, that number is two. Take the NSA Surveillance Program that we’ve all heard about. Again, this is a program that every President in war has used -- sometimes without judicial supervision, often without Congressional authorization, often without the knowledge of anybody – in order to gain information on pending attacks. So when you try to take into account these factors – the gains of security, which I think we’ve had and a loss of civil liberties – how should you think about this problem? Let me make – just close by making just a few points. First, have the expanses… expansions in government power been worth it? I would say, Yes, look at the results. There have been no attacks since 9/11. And it’s not because of luck. I think as even the 9/11 Commission Report, the Silverman-Robb Report have, uh, said, as the administration and members of Congress have said – these expanded surveillance powers have resulted in the capture or prevent, capture of Al Qaeda members inside the United States and the prevention of plots. Since 9/11 the United States has succeeded in capturing or killing two-thirds of Al Qaeda’s leadership at the time of 9/11. Again, that’s not just through luck. Second point: Are civil liberties being permanently reduced? I think many thoughtful people would say, Yes, there’s a tradeoff, but I would be worried if we reduce civil liberties in wartime in a way that once the war is over civil liberties are permanently reduced. There is no way for me to tell you what’s going to happen once this war is over. But if you look at past American history wartime has not produced a significant permanent reduction in civil liberties. Actually, if you look at the historical record, after war we usually as a society experience our greatest growth in civil liberties. The Civil War saw the passage of the Reconstruction Amendments and –the Emancipation Proclamation. World War II was followed by the Warren Court. The last point: complacency, I think, is the real enemy. Even having this debate is a show, a sign of the confidence we have that our system is working. But we should be aware that we’re fighting a different kind of enemy, a nonnation state that conceals its activities as normal civilian communications, as normal civilian travel. The hard thing is how, as a society do we fight that, fight a war against an enemy who is not following the rules of war and tries to disguise itself as one of us. I’ll close by saying I think so far we have made a successful balance between civil liberties and security. We have reduced attacks and threats on the country. I think those gains have been worth it. And the question is, I think, for all of us today, is whether we would feel comfortable reducing the amount of government powers and by doing so, give up some of the security we’ve bought at such a, I think, dear price since 9/11. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you very much. Andy, uh, I hate to burst your bubble but the reason why the ACLU is required to submit those who seek admittance to, uh, some kind of I.D. procedure is because we are only tenants in the building and our strenuous objections were not well received by the landlord. And I have to tell you, just to illustrate how, uh, counter-productive or at least unproductive these kinds of pseudo-security measures are, um, ACLU lawyers were so distressed that we were subjected – you don’t have Constitutional rights against a private landlord. They were so, uh, distressed that they were subjected to those measures that they would sign in, uh, under names such as Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atta and had absolutely no problem. Uh, stupid security. Uh, Bruce Schneier, one of the leading security experts in the country, uh, says that what we have seen post-9/11 is security theatre, not real security. Uh, I also feel that since we’ve had two FBI, uh, stories from, uh, David and from Andy that I will tell my own FBI story – uh, namely, the former FBI Special Agent who is now working for the ACLU as a policy counsel, who, uh, did our, uh, extremely detailed analysis of the recent report by the Office of Inspector General about the massive abuses and fabrications and misuses of the national security letter, uh, and the lies that have been told about this to the public and to Congress. And, uh, this gets to the fundamental point of trust that has been raised on both sides here. Not, I don’t mean to condemn the FBI as an institution or condemn particular individuals. I’m talking about human nature and political nature and official nature – the reasons why our founders had the genius of creating a system of checks and balances. And we are not saying that there should not be any monitoring or any surveillance at all. We are simply saying it should be done pursuant to the checks and balances that exist in the Constitution but have been, uh, completely ignored in so many post-9/11 measures. I, I welcome the pi…spirit of co…collegiality in this program. And so in that spirit I’m going to begin my argument against – or I should say, continue my argument -- against the domestic spying and, uh, Big Brother type approach that the other side has been advocating by quoting someone whose policies they are defending none other than President George W. Bush himself. In the President’s very first public statement on that infamous date of September 11th, he hailed our nation as the brightest beacon of freedom in the world. And he vowed that no one will keep that light from shining. Well, ever since then the ACLU has been working very hard to help the President keep that vow. It would be tragic if we let the terrorists terrorize us into abandoning the very ideals that they attacked. And that is the key reason why you must vote no on tonight’s resolution, why more domestic surveillance is not better than another 9/11. Indeed, with more surveillance of the type that has been proliferating since 9/11 – namely, surveillance that is unjustified, unwarranted, unchecked – not to mention un- Constitutional – with more of this kind of surveillance the terrorists don’t need another 9/11 to accomplish their goals. Of course, on that dreadful date thousands of people were horribly killed but their tragic deaths were not the terrorists’ goal. Rather, they were a means to another broader goal – to terrify all of us and to sabotage our country’s democratic ideals of liberty and justice for all. Sadly, the terrorists have made great strides toward that goal through the original 9/11 attacks – actually, more accurately, through our own government’s reaction to those attacks. That key point was well captured by some satiric but apt definitions from The Nation magazine’s online dictionary of current political terminology. Here are its two definitions of Patriot Act – sad but true. The first one is: the pre-emptive strike on American freedoms to prevent the terrorists from destroying them first. The second is: the elimination of one of the reasons why they hate us. In my limited time I can’t respond to all of the, uh, misguided, misleading statements you have heard tonight from my – with all due respect – to my opponents. Um, but I’m going to start by briefly listing some of the major reasons for rejecting these kinds of measures. Uh, first, I want to reiterate that we are not opposing, uh, surveillance per se but only surveillance that is not carried out in accordance with the Constitution’s precepts. Many leading law enforcement and national security experts confirm that such Constitutionally appropriate surveillance is at least as effective as the illicit post-9/11 measures. And let me quote one of them, who has been very outspoken – Judge William Webster, who was Director of both the FBI and the CIA under Presidents Reagan and Bush I – criticizing the sweeping post- 9/11 measures. He said, From 1981 to 2000 the FBI prevented more than one hundred thirty terrorist attacks. We used good investigative tech…techniques and lawful techniques. We did it without all the suggestions that we’re going to jump all over people’s private lives. We don’t need to go in that direction. Uh, second, the Constitutional standards -- in particular the Fourth Amendment’s core requirement of individualized suspicion – uh, that is designed to preserve both safety and individual liberty. In contrast, too many post-9/11 surveillance programs are just overly broad, dragnets, fishing expeditions. And that means by definition, they are doubly flawed. On the one hand, they’re sweeping in too much information about too many completely innocent individuals, and on the other hand, they are failing to hone in on the dangerous ones. As many critics have put it, the government is trying to find a needle in the haystack, by adding more hay to the stack. Uh, my next point is that by state-voting civil liberties, we are ignoring the more effective measures that would in fact, according to national security experts and counter-terrorism experts, be more effective as well as consistent with civil liberties. Uh, since our opponents have referred to the 9/11 Commission report, I have to say that I, uh, read that report completely differently, out of 41 specific recommendations of steps we should take to prevent another 9/11, almost none of them have anything to do with increasing the government’s surveillance power. And unfortunately, according to, uh, the report, with letter grades that was issued a couple of years after the initial recommendations, the government got D’s and F’s on most of the very significant, concrete recommendations, so we have not exhausted those, uh, alternatives that would help to make us both safe and free. Unfortunately, the government now has gone in the opposite direction, uh, and if we increase this kind of surveillance, uh, we are going to have the worst of both worlds. Because we will all be less free, but not more safe"

    "data":"Well, I will be happy to answer that. Let me first tell you that I must say in response to your discussion about the title of this debate, about the proposition itself, I was a little bit uptight about it originally because, after all, we are debating this issue here in New York City a few miles from Ellis Island. And I have been -- I have participated in things in the past that have been a little bit skewed, and I can recall a spoof of me, a debate -- or actually it was supposed to be a little discussion between me and Vincente Fox, but it was a spoof on Saturday Night Live, and so they had someone who looked like -- and I knew it was biased from the beginning, from the very beginning because the guy playing me looked like me and the guy playing Vincente Fox was Antonio Banderas No fair, come on, guys. Frankly, I -- you look at it and begin to think about the ramifications of immigration, both legal and illegal, and they are fascinating. It is really one of the most intellectually stimulating areas of public policy I think we can possibly talk about. A great deal of mythology has built up around the Statue of Liberty, around the Emma Lazarus poem, and a lot of that mythology, of course, is just that. It's mythology. But unfortunately we have a tendency in the United States, we look back sort of nostalgically at a period of time because most of us are either children of or grandchildren of immigrants, and so the whole idea of immigration has a sort of a nostalgic appeal to us, and that's our first thought usually. And I am the same way. I am the grandson of Italian immigrants, came right here into Ellis Island. And my parents being first generation Americans were very, very strict about one thing and that was to become an American, to become -- and it meant a lot of things to them in different ways, and I'll get to it in a minute, except that I do want you to understand I have that same nostalgic opinion to a large extent of what our immigration policy was, but we can't confuse that and make -- and develop true policy today based on mythology and, you know, some of the myths that we have to dispel. I think tonight's a good place to do it, it’s -- first of all the Statue of Liberty was not a gift from France that was designed to explore the wonderful idea of open immigration. Indeed it had nothing to do with immigration policy. It had everything to do with extolling the virtues of a republic. In fact, the statue was called “Liberty Enlightening the World.” It was not called “Liberty Inviting the World.” As for the Emma Lazarus poem, it was added 30 years after the statue got here. And it was about that time that the author of the poem, Ms. Lazarus, was talking about the need to limit immigration to various groups. Remember also that a lot of the tired, and poor, and huddled masses got stamped “return to sender here at Ellis Island. There were people with dangerous elements and ailments like pinkeye or a cough or fever, and if anyone exhibited any degree of exhaustion by climbing the very steep stairway over at Ellis Island which was purposely built that way, that was one of the things that could get you sent home. It was not a take all comers time in American history. As for the poor, well, long before the Ellis Island experience, the colonies had enacted very, very stringent regulations about this particular aspect of immigration policy. In New York in 1691, it required an immigrant to have, quote, A visible estate or manual occupation or give a sufficient surety that he shall not be a burden or a charge to the respective place that he shall come to inhabit. In 1996 in the Congress of the United States, they tried to actually expand on this and say that you had to have an affidavit signed by someone if you’re coming here, you had to have an affidavit of support. They put it in, it was part of the Welfare Reform Bill, never, not one time, never has it been enforced. And so the fact is we are in a -- unfortunately, we are importing a large degree of poverty into the United States. The National Academy of Sciences along with the Center for Immigration studies shows that welfare use, the rates for welfare use, are significantly higher for immigrant households than they are for nonimmigrant households.  Federation for Immigration Reform could identify a net cost, net cost after taxes were paid by illegal immigrants, they were just focusing on that one part, a net cost to American taxpayers of over $150 billion annually. Now, my point here is to show that for a long period of time in American history, we had what I would think was, and believe, is a rational policy. It was rational for us to bring in a lot of people, especially during the hay-day of American immigration, the 1890s and 1900s, a lot of people who were low-skill, low-wage people. Why? Because, of course, we were building the Industrial Revolution here. They were fueling it. That was appropriate. It was right. It served purpose for the people coming and it served a purpose for the people here. I hope -- well, also, as I see we’re getting toward the end of that 7-minute period, there is another myth I want to try to dispel quickly. And that is that immigration has always been sort of a straight-line increase from the time America started until today, that it’s always just been going up. Absolutely untrue. About 1830 is when immigration began to be statistically relevant in the United States. It started to climb. By 1850, it started to go down. Around 1880, it grew. Around 1890, it declined. It rose dramatically right before the First World War, but declined dramatically after the First World War with the Immigration Act of 1924. It stayed relatively low for a long period of time until, as a matter of fact, 1965, when everything changed with the Immigration Act that was pushed by Senator Kennedy at the time, Senator Teddy Kennedy. And we’ve had now really massive immigration, low-skill, low-wage workers ever since that period of time. Now whether or not those -- that cyclical movement and that cyclical characterization I just gave you of immigration was purposeful or not. It had and served a good purpose, I think. We had periods of high immigration. We had periods of low immigration. And you know what happened during the periods of low immigration? People used that time to assimilate. And let me tell you, from my point of view, this is by far the most important aspect of the debate. Assimilation -- we can have massive amounts of immigration to this country, the right time and the right type of immigration, especially, as I say, depending upon our needs here as long as we have assimilation along with it. Or, if it doesn’t happen along with it, it has to happen at that period of time that we take a break, which is not a bad idea for us to think about even now, because assimilation is not occurring. It’s not occurring to the extent -- I mean, I know you can’t categorically say that, but it is certainly not occurring to the extent that we need it to in this country. We desperately need, perhaps more than any country in the world, we need things to hold us together, to think about as being Americans, to connect together, not pull us apart. And I’m afraid our immigration policy is doing just that. "

    "data":"Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, and let me say thank you, John, and to everyone here at “Intelligence Squared,” to Congressman Tancredo, Secretary Kobach, and to all the folks who showed up tonight. We appreciate being here. Tamar Jacoby and I have the distinct pleasure of arguing against the motion on the table tonight. You know, last week, I’m a little bit embarrassed to say that at 3:20 in the morning, Central Time, I woke up to flip on CNN to watch the Royal Wedding. I admit it. I couldn’t help myself. It was one of those moments that you’d just rather see live than see on tape. My wife didn’t even wake up. She stayed asleep and I woke up. And they had about two hours of coverage before the bride actually showed up on the doorstep of Westminster Abbey. And in the background of the coverage in one of the shots on ABC or CNN one of the networks that was covering it, there was laid out on a fence post, the United States flag, the flag of America. And I was surprised to see that, although it was a welcome sight. But there was something in my mind that told me that that American flag looked out of place at the Royal Wedding. And as I thought about it more, the reason that our American flag looked out of place is because our country has never been a country about royalty or caste or one's station in life. It has always been defined as a country for the strivers, for the aspirers, for the folks who can pull themselves up by their boot straps, who are willing to take the chance, the entrepreneurs, most of whom start off as folks of lesser means, folks who make themselves. And this country, the United States, of all the countries in the world and all the countries throughout history, has defined itself as the nation that has taken in folks from around the world and allowed them to pursue their dreams, to reach their American dream and to become, from some who was poor and huddled among masses, to someone who is successful and able to enjoy the fruits of the capitalist system. And so it is that I believe we need to continue to welcome not only the wealthy but the poor from other countries. We need to do that for several reasons. The first is that immigrants are vital to our national economy. Immigrants actually found companies at almost twice the rate of native born U.S. citizens. Companies founded by immigrants in the years between 1995 and 2005 actually created 450,000 jobs in the United States of America. In one single year, they generated $52 billion in sales in industries like high technology and engineering; that the number of folks who start those companies is at 25 percent nationally. And in Silicon Valley, it's at 52.4 percent. And remember, it is a false distinction to think that the folks who found these companies start off as wealthy. Oftentimes they don't. Think about your own experience, either in your own family, or how many times have you heard someone tell the story of their family member who came here with just a few dollars in their pocket and were able to contribute great things to this country? Congressman Tancredo also mentioned the idea of assimilation. And I believe that it is important for folks generally to assimilate to a common culture in the United States. And that's exactly what has been happening in the United States of America throughout our history with immigrants. What we have seen consistently, and I think that Congressman Tancredo and I agree, what we have seen is that from time to time there has been this very intense concern about balkanization. Benjamin Franklin famously said that we should rid Pennsylvania of the Germans in 1751. We had the Alien and Sedition Act of 1798, the Chinese Exclusion Act. We had the fear in the early 1940s during World War II that Germans and Japanese would somehow try and overthrow the government of the United States. The reason that we have succeeded as a nation, that today we are the most powerful economy in the world is that we have been able to overcome those impulses. And I believe that we need to continue to overcome those impulses for the future. It's also incorrect to say that immigrants only take, and they don't give. In 1993, the Urban Institute did a study that found that 94 percent of immigrants were not on welfare and that the distinction between immigrants and natives in terms of who was on welfare was less than three percent. They also contribute up to $240 billion in taxes overall into Social Security and Medicare that they're actually never going to get a chance to use. And the National Conference of State Legislatures, a few years ago, did an analysis of 16 different states. And they found that in five of those, including some of the biggest ones, New York and Texas, that there was a net positive from immigrants, including illegal immigrants, versus a negative. And so this idea that they don't pay taxes, that they only take, that they're on welfare, the evidence clearly demonstrates that that's not the case. I also believe, and I anticipate that some may argue that having so many folks come to our country is not good in terms of crime. The numbers bear out that immigrant communities are actually safer than nonimmigrant communities. Terrorism, the idea that somehow there are many folks walking across our borders that are going to commit acts of terror against folks in the United States. I don't believe that's true, either. In fact, in 2010, of the 463,000 apprehensions that we had in the United States, two 10,000ths of one percent were apprehensions from folks that, excluding Cuba, were from countries that were listed as a state sponsor of terror. What we're catching really are a whole bunch of folks who are yearning to breathe free, who are chasing the same values. Congressman Tancredo asked what's going to keep us together. What's going to keep us together is what always has kept us together as a nation, the fact that people come here to work. They're entrepreneurial. They believe in democracy. They're people of good faith. They have the same values that have always made America great. And I hope we'll continue to do so if we can get the policy right. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you. My work in terms of immigration policy at the national level began in 2001 when I served as counsel to John Ashcroft at the Justice Department. And after I left the Justice Department in 2003, I left with a very important idea in my head and that was that the rule of law has broken down in immigration, and much had to be done to restore it. But it had to be done not only at the national level, but also at the state level. And that's why I got involved helping states like Arizona and many other states. In 2007 for the first time, every state in the country saw legislation introduced into the state legislature to, in some way, restrict or slow down the pace of immigration into that state. Not all of them passed, but that's an important point. Every state is a border state now. The reason that nearly all of the states on the map are trying to take steps to discourage illegal immigration is several-fold. But the number one driver is a very important point in this debate, and I'd like to start there. The fiscal cost, fiscal cost, the cost to governments, to taxpayers to the illegal immigration in particular is unsustainable. My point can be summarized in one sentence by Nobel laureate, Milton Friedman. He said, it's just obvious. You can't have open immigration and a welfare state. You can't have open immigration and a welfare state. Now, my guess is that there are a few fans of the welfare state here in the audience. I am not a big fan myself, I accept the reality that it's here to stay. And given that reality, there is an important distinction that needs to be made between the current wave of immigration, which started in the '80s and has been going unabated for three decades, and all preceding waves of immigration. They were not immigrating into a welfare state. They were immigrating into a situation where they rose or they fell based on their own merits. There was no safety net to catch them. That is a critical distinction that changes everything. When Emma Lazarus wrote that poem, she spoke of a lady holding the golden -- the lamp by the golden door. Now, the golden door she was referring to was a golden door of opportunity. You come here, you're free to do whatever you can. You make it or you lose it, but it's all up to you. Now that golden door represents goodies, public benefits, services that are available to people who come to the United States more than any other nation in the Western hemisphere. The golden door represents something completely different. Now, aliens are consuming those benefits far more than U.S. citizens are doing so. Now, the average per household consumption -- that consumption of public services and benefits, is estimated, from a 2007 figure, not 1993 numbers, 2007, to be $19,400 per year net. They're consuming -- and this is all immigrants, the illegal and legal combined. 19,400 per year more in services than they're paying it in taxes. So that's a net drag on the fiscal status of the country. Now, Julián mentioned this 1993 study. I have not seen that study. That is so old I wouldn't even know where to begin because the numbers are so different back then. Now we're talking 11.3 million illegal aliens in the country. There was also a study that came out last month based on census figures from 2010, and the number was generated by the Center for Immigration Studies, crunching the numbers, 71 percent of illegal alien households are consuming some form of welfare, 52 percent of lawfully present alien-headed households are consuming some form of welfare, in contrast to only 39 percent of the U.S. citizen-headed households are consuming some form of welfare. Now, the explanation for this is obvious. It has nothing to do with ethnicity or nationality, it has everything to do with economics and demographics. Poor people are more likely to consume welfare. And immigrants coming into the United States, especially illegal immigrants, are almost in all cases having less than a high school education. If you look at all immigrants combined, about two-thirds have a high school education or less, and so we are importing a very impoverished set of immigrants, both legal and illegal, into the country. Here's another fact to chew on. The Mexico-American border has the greatest disparity in income levels of any border on the planet. There is no other national border where the difference between the rich country and the poor country per capita is greater. That fuels a lot of this fiscal cost, too. So since 1996, Congress has passed laws trying to discourage this handing out of public benefits because it exacerbates the problem. Most states have ignored that law. New York is one of the states that continues to give public benefits to illegal aliens. New York also gives in-state tuition rates to certain illegal aliens. Think about that if you are a well, I don't think any of the out-of-state students who are at a public institution are clapping right now because they're paying out-of-state tuition rates. Now, the -- nationwide, as Tom mentioned, it's over $100 billion a year net that is flowing out to illegal aliens, that is to say, they're consuming that much more in benefits than they're paying in taxes. And the burden falls overwhelmingly at the states. Indeed, I like to say illegal immigration is the ultimate unfunded federal mandate because the federal government, which is chiefly responsible for enforcing the laws, fails to do so, and then the states have to pay the burden. You can think of story after story about this. Hazelton, Pennsylvania, one of the cities that I'm representing, they saw their population explode from 20,000 in the year 2000 to about 30,000 five years later, 50 percent increase in population, but they get most of their revenue from an earned income tax and their revenue remained flat. Population goes up 50 percent, no additional tax revenue, that was because most of the additional people coming in were working at a meat packing plant nearby, were illegal aliens, and they were either earning too little income to pay any taxes or they were earning purely cash income. And the city wasn't getting any revenues. Look what happened. All the costs to the city went up 50 percent, all the costs contingent on population. The school districts, the budget was breaking, English as a Second Language, the expenditures in 2002 were 136,000 that year. In 2006, they went up to 1.1 million. Talk about that kind of burden on a small town school district. The same thing is happening at the national level. And as a result, we have to recognize that there is a fiscal cost. Or take it on the individual level. Look at the jobs. There are 14 million Americans out of work. A vast majority of the 11.3 illegal -- million illegal aliens have those jobs, about seven million are in the workforce. Many states are realizing the simple truth, if you want to create a real job for a U.S. citizen tomorrow, deport an illegal alien today. It actually works. But of course many of you are probably thinking, and I'm sure we'll hear from the other side, that those are jobs Americans won't do, that those are jobs that are too low on the totem pole for Americans to do. Well, the statistics don't bear that out because in every single one of the industry -- industrial sectors where illegal aliens are prominent, U.S. citizens still have the majority of jobs there, 74 percent of construction workers, U.S. citizens, 76 percent of food preparation workers, U.S. citizens, 56 percent of agriculture laborers, U.S. citizens. The U.S. citizens are there, and they're working right alongside the illegal aliens who are depressing the wages or taking their jobs outright. So if we care about our fiscal health, and if we care about the Americans who are struggling to put food on the table, we should look very seriously at our immigration problem in the United States. "

    "data":"Thank you so much, and thank you so much to the sponsors of this event. So, like all of us, I’m a descendant of immigrants. In my case, there were two kinds of immigrants. On one side were the Eastern European Jews, and on the other side were the people who came on The Mayflower. So, I grew up in a house where I had two lessons. One was that difference was really kind of what made us great. It’s certainly what made the two sides of my family great. And I learned to understand later it was what made the country great. But I also learned that, in many ways, what we have in common -- this was another lesson in my household -- what we have in common is more important than our differences. And so I see the challenge for the country going forward, as it was in my family, is to make sure that balance is in the right -- is in balance, that we’re getting the benefits of the difference, but we’re also holding together as one country. And that’s where I start when I’m considering immigration. It’s not -- there have been words thrown around here: nostalgia, generosity, I’m not sure anybody mentioned rights, but that’s another way that a lot of people come at it. I don’t come at immigration from any of those perspectives. I come at it from what is in America’s interest. What’s really good for us, for our economy, for our security, and for our future? And that’s why I’m dead set against this motion. I don’t think it’s good for our economy or for our values. So let’s start by being honest. Immigration is about economics. It’s driven by economics, for the people who get up in their home villages and come here, and it’s driven by economics for the Americans who hire them. And the bottom line is it turns out to be an economic win-win. Immigrants create jobs. And contrary to what you’ve just heard from Kris Kobach, it’s counterintuitive, I know, but you heard me right. Immigrants create jobs. It’s easy to see how that works on the high end. The 25 percent of the patents in the United States that are taken out by people who are foreign-born, the 25 percent of the doctors in America who are foreign-born, the 25 percent of the nurses, the half of all of our science and engineering Ph.D.s who are foreign-born. And you heard it from my partner, Julián, the quarter of the tech startups that were started by foreign-born. As in the past, countries competed -- powerful countries competed for coal and iron-ore in colonies. Today, countries around the world are competing for high-end engineers and smart immigrants. But it’s true at the low end, too, that immigrants create jobs. And again, I know this gets even more counterintuitive, but, you know, I’ll never forget here -- and this is really what partly brought me to do exactly what I’m doing now hearing the man who ran a seafood processing plant on the Eastern Shore of Maryland talk about his company. He came to the floor of the Senate and he did this. He talked about how he had a 100-year-old family company. The native born people on the Eastern Shore no longer wanted to do the hard seasonal work. Americans like full -- year-round jobs. No one wanted to do the hard seasonal work of picking the crab out of the shell. So he brought Mexican women every summer to pick those crabs out of the shell -- very low-paid, uneducated people, seasonal workers. You know, that’s the low end of the economic totem pole. But because he had those seasonal workers, he could actually keep his company open in a way that he wouldn’t have been able to if he didn’t have them. And because he kept his company open, there was a job for the manager in the company and the people who packaged the seafood and the accountant in the company. And because he could keep his company open, there was seafood for the restaurants in the town where the tourists came to eat seafood. And because those restaurants and the seafood, hotels, gas stations, insurers, you can get the picture -- up and down the food chain, those lowly, lowest bottom-of-the-totem seafood pickers were keeping an economy going. And the point is that on both the top and the bottom end of our economy, the bottom of the skill ladder and the top of the skill ladder, we have holes that needs filling by a foreign workforce. The American workforce is changing. We’re getting older. People are -- we’re having smaller families. People are retiring sooner. We’ve created -- we have holes at the top and bottom of the workforce, and we’re lucky that they’re filled by immigrants who, because they’re different from Americans, either more or less skilled, they’re complementary, not competitive. They create jobs for Americans. Of course, there are costs, and we’ll talk more about the costs in this -- I don’t deny there are costs to immigration, but in the long run, ultimately, the good far outweighs the bad. Our need for workers also changes. That’s not so -- in a bad economy, we need fewer foreign workers and in a good economy, we need more. But ultimately, the point is the patents, those PhDs, the startups and the jobs for U.S. workers up and down the food chain. And the 64 million question for me is how are we as a country going to handle what I think is a given of the interconnected world. We're lucky immigrants are coming to fill these niches at the top and bottom of our economy. And how are we going to handle it in a way that's consistent with our values, that maximizes the benefits, minimizes the cost and is consistent with our values? And this is really where I differ from my opponents in this debate. I too am for the rule of law. I too am for security and effective enforcement. But I also think we need to be honest about our needs. It doesn't really work I don't think to have two signs at the border, one that says, Help wanted, -- one that says, Keep Out and one that says Help Wanted. I don't think that's an honest standup way to go about our business. I don't think we want to treat the people who come to work for us -- I think we want to treat them in an honest, standup way. We don't want to say, Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, come on in when times are good and then harass them with policing laws when times are bad to so that they leave. Ultimately, that's what I think today's debate is about. It's about how to do we deal with the reality of our economic needs in a way that's consistent with our values? And if you listen tonight, what I think you should be asking yourself is whose way is more likely to lead to a successful immigration and successful integration or assimilation? Is the best way accepting reality, allowing people to be here legally, treating them with dignity, or is the best way pretending that we don't need these workers, pretending that we can drive them out when we can't and driving them further underground?

    "data":"We changed it ‘cause there was some confusion. Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, thank you so much for joining us tonight to consider this most important topic. Before delving in I still have in my mind a song I heard on the way to the airport on the radio, which went like this. “I’m not a saint but I’m not a sinner, everything’s cool as long as I’m getting thinner.” Which, I think, expresses a profound truth, actually. It’s a serious question. In a society in which the self is the body, to some degree, as long as we’re getting thinner, do we even believe that there is such a thing as a sexual right, and a sexual wrong. Nobody wants to judge. Adultery is now a lifestyle choice. A 22-year-old woman from San Diego, is now auctioning off her virginity to the highest bidder. Right? And we’re not supposed to judge. And yet I would submit that we do judge, all the time. When I was living here in Manhattan some 10 years ago, I’ll never forget the time when I was innocently buying my Metro pass, and sipping my coffee, and a man came up from” behind me and barked at me and he said, you know, you shouldn’t drink those frappaccinos, they’re very fattening. And I was shocked that a perfect stranger would presume to judge my beverage choices that way. But then I realized that everybody has a notion of right and wrong and to this man frappaccinos were just wrong. My worthy opponent, Sydney Barrows, writes in her memoir, Mayflower Madame, that a DNS in the call girl business stood for “Do not send.” Men who were obnoxious or who had really gross apartments, she wouldn’t send her girls to such men. And she also writes, “Whenever I read about a business who had done something I didn’t approve of, such as a building an ugly high rise in a residential neighborhood, I added his name to the list, just in case he ever called us.” Which I thought was really funny, also.To some people, building an ugly high-rise is morally wrong. It’s an offense against the aesthetic order. Ladies and gentlemen, I would submit to you that paying for sex is at least as wrong as building an ugly high rise. Perhaps more so. Why, because we’re using— we’re talking about using a human being as a means to your ends. Today people want to believe that paying for sex is just like paying for a hamburger. But a sexual transaction is different, because it teaches on the deepest, most personal aspects of ourselves. The proof that sex is different, in my opinion, is our response to the terrible crime of rape. If paying for sex were as morally neutral as paying for a hamburger, well then, rape is akin to just forcing someone to eat a hamburger. Right? But of course it is not. It is a horrible crime, that is serious, precisely because sexuality touches on the deepest, most personal aspect of our humanity. And to take something so intimate, and to turn it into a commodity, has farreaching, devastating effects, for men, women and children. Everyone agrees that after the Netherlands adopted legalization that this has added fuel to the gangs who trafficked in underage girls, and that the abuse in child prostitution exploded rather than was reduced. It’s time to ask why. Well, firstly what we value in women, eventually trickles down to girls. For example today we place a lot of value on hotness in women, have you noticed this? And so, now in, for example in the Bratts Babies video, which is watched by three- and four-year-old girls by the way, you can hear cartoon babies singing songs about “being hotter than hot, show what you’ve got, ready or not.” For threeyear- olds. What we value in women inevitably trickles down to girls. Secondly prostitution, like all industries, is demand-led. Someone could go to great trouble manufacturing coats made from cockroaches, but since nobody wants cockroach coats, the supplier would soon find that there’s no market, no demand, and no money in it, except may Ozzy Osbourne would buy it. But because prostitution is demand-led, it’s the paying for sex that’s a problem. That’s what creates the demand, and given that the average age of entry into prostitution is 13 or 14 years old, I think this presents a huge moral problem. I receive a ton of emails from girls who are 14, 15, leave home, because they’ve been abused, only to try to escape prostitution. Unfortunately at the time, one writes to me, “It was all I felt I had to offer the world, my body. As you can no doubt guess, I was molested by my father for many years when I was a child. It’s why my mother let me leave. So in a sense I was raised to believe my body had only one use, and I was worth only this one thing.” We can talk later about why the molestation rates for prostitutes are so high, why the suicide rates are so high. But, right now I wanna focus on the fact that the problem is that nobody knows if these girls are 14 or 18. And, we think about the sheer number of sex slaves in captivity in the US, we’re talking about, anything from 30,000 to 50,000. It’s staggering, and it’s sickening. We’re talking about girls that are having sex with 20 to 30 men per day, one girl told the New York Times about her cell of traffickers, her captors offered three age ranges of sex partners, toddler to age four, age five to 12, and teens as well as the damage group…where they could do anything that they wanted. When one of the Mexican child-trafficking rings was busted in a house in Plainfield, New Jersey, uh, another Mexican ring was recently busted--but this one was a few years ago—the neighbors, in retrospect thought about all the cars that came, and all of the girls that… left that house to buy candy, but they always said no one knew what was going on. I’m always struck that the neighbors always say this, well somebody knew what was going on because someone was paying for the sex. To those who are against trafficking, but they insist that some women have nothing else to sell but their bodies, I say that they suffer from a real lack of imagination. About the power of the human spirit and about the strength of women in particular and if you keep up with the Harvard Business Review, you may have noticed, that they’re now talking about micro-loans to poor women and only lending them, only having these loans to poor women. Right? Because they notice that the poorest of women reinvest in the household and the men do not. So…we have to believe in the women first, it takes a risk to give them that loan. If instead we demand their bodies instead of appealing to their intelligence, it’s this philosophy of this is all she can do, and the not too subtle misogyny behind it, that feeds the demand and expectations that cause the problem.

    "data":"Thank you very much, thank you, Wendy, for starting this off in a serious and interesting manner. I have to say, I’m quite confounded by this, because it’s quite clearly wrong to pay for wrong sex. There is no one in this room I daresay, who will shed a tear for anyone who is jailed for trafficking in toddlers. That I think is an absurdity, to start a discussion about the very serious, momentous issue of human sexuality. So, we’re all opposed to coercive, we’re all opposed unequivocally, I’m sure, to the kind of stories we hear about the Russian Mafia trafficking women whose passports are stolen from them and then they have to work off their fare and so on. These are all obvious. They’re not debatable. I won’t debate them, therefore. But what we have with respect to, Wendy just heard is [sic], a perfect contemporary exposition of the early 20th century sociological fallacy, which is you look for a deviant phenomenon, and attribute to that the nature of the normal. So by talking about rape, talking about toddlers being abused sexually, this then frames the entire discussion of what you guys and gals may decide to do in your own homes with your own lust, with your own love, and that is simply methodologically wrong. Furthermore, it begins from a premise that legal distinctions constitute the vocabulary of life’s distinctions. And again, this is simply methodologically improper. So for example in American sociology many early sociologists would look at prison behavior and say ah-ha, this is what life is really like. It’s not. It’s a prison. It’s what it is because of what it is. It’s not reflective. And furthermore, I get here, and forgive me for maybe being, counter-casting here, but I think this entire argument somehow is profoundly disrespectful to females. If you want to see people paying for sex, I suggest you go to the ground floor of Bloomingdale’s. The place is full of women paying for garments, colors, clasps, various instruments of torture— lust, you name it, but they’re paying for their own sense of themselves as sexual creatures, and they’re not on that floor because they don’t like sex and they don’t like what it means. And furthermore, what it tells us about is, that there’s an inner economy to sex, that doesn’t have to do with raping toddlers, with raping girls who are abused by their fathers, please. If you’re raped by your father you’ve got a problem independently of the one we’re discussing. That’s just how it is. There was a remarkable story in the Times, last couple of weeks ago, about a website called SeekingArrangement.com. In this website, men and women can sign up to be -- essentially a rich Wall Street executive, thank you, Mr. Rosenkranz for the metaphor—to be set up and go through graduate school. Now in this system, which is not explicitly about sex, it’s about a wide variety of things, the ratio of women applying to men, is 10 to one. Free choice. 10 to one. These are probably women you know, I know, who knows. But the fact is that—and this is just one anecdote and it’s not typical of everything, please don’t overextend it, but the fact is that women have a deal with men which requires that they have some relationship with men, especially if they’re inclined to reproduce which still 80 percent of women in North America. And women know that they will have five to eight years when they’re out of the labor force, and, it helps to have a guy around the place. And so…The fact is that if we’re looking just now, Mr. Donvan mentioned the current male female balance. In this current recession or depression or whatever it’s called, 82 percent of the jobs lost are male jobs. That means that, women will not have a guy—if they want one…this is free choice, please, I’m not an obligatory heterosexual mastermind here but if women want a mate, then they’re not going to have…one of those men that has lost a job. It’s a complicated argument but it’s a long story, I’m an anthropologist, we’re interested in what people around the world do, 90—over 90 percent of human marriages are arranged. They’re determined by families in terms of the larger interests of the two clans, they usually involve a bride price or a dowry, or something like that in which the male usually commits himself to sustaining the female, we don’t do it with cattle, we do it with some exotic unit called the diamond ring. An engagement ring is the world’s stupidest object, the moment you take it out of the store, it’s lost 80 percent of its value, if in fact it has any value at all, just ask DeBeers, there’s—they’re crying. But, the guy has to pay two months’ after-tax income for this diamond ring, to give to the gal to assure her that he’s going to be okay. Now, if he’s not, she keeps the ring. But the point is that this is a—This is a classic anthropological phenomenon, my time is quickly run out, I had no idea that…"

    "data":"Thank you. Thanks. Some words hide the truth. Just as torture is named, enhanced interrogation,” and the logging of old-growth forests is called the Healthy Forest Initiative, so also prostitution is named a choice, a job, work, a victimless crime, and on Craigslist it’s called a wide range of personal meeting and relationship opportunities.” These pimp-messaged slogans are good for business but there’s not much truth to them. What’s wrong with prostitution is the renting out of a woman’s mouth, vagina, or anus, and what it does to her, psychologically. What’s wrong with prostitution, and what’s wrong with buying sex, are the same things that are wrong with other forms of violence against women, incest, rape, and battery. I’ve been researching prostitution for 15 years, we’ve interviewed 900 women, men, and transgendered people in prostitution, in nine countries on five continents. And over the course of that time we’ve also interviewed 500 johns. Prostitution is not a choice because the precise conditions that make a choice are absent. For example, equality with buyers, and physical safety, and real alternatives. If you imagine a pyramid, remember that only about the top 5 percent of all women in prostitution are at the top of that pyramid. These are people that are privileged by race and class. The other 95 percent don’t have those kinds of privilege or alternatives for escape. Let me give you some examples of the sex inequality, the race-ethnic inequality, and the economic inequality in prostitution that are often invisible. A woman in Lusaka, who knew that five blow jobs would get her a sack of mealy meal to feed her kids. That’s not a choice. A woman in India who worked in an office where she concluded that she might as well be paid for the sexual harassment that was expected of her anyway, in her job. That’s not a choice. The teen in California who said that in her neighborhood, boys grew up to be dealers and pimps and girls to be ‘hos. She was the third generation of prostituted women in her family. And prostitution more severely harms people who are indigenous or ethnically marginalized because of their lack of alternatives. That’s not a choice. Or the young woman sold by her parents in a brothel in Nevada. She took six different psychiatric drugs to make it through the day, selling sex, that’s not a choice, or Ashley Dupre, who was bought by Governor Spitzer. Dupre ran away from what she called an abusive home at 17, she’d been homeless, she had a drug problem, a convicted New York pimp bragged that he turned her out. And at 17 pornography was made of her by a man who had a prostitution conviction. The Emperors Club, where Spitzer bought her, was run by pimps who charged a lot because they said it was high-class call girls. But it was the same as any other pimps, they took their 50 percent off the top. Like a majority of johns, Spitzer most likely enticed, coerced or persuaded her with money to put her life on the line by not using a condom. That’s not a freely made choice. Women in prostitution face a statistical likelihood of weekly rape. A Canadian woman in prostitution said, what’s rape for others is normal for us. A woman at a legal brothel in Nevada said, it’s like you sign a contract to be raped. And in Chicago, the same frequency of rape was reported by women in both escort and street prostitution. Women in prostitution are seen as body parts or fake girlfriends and their feelings don’t matter, and they’re not seen as human which is perhaps why they’re murdered at a higher rate than any other group of women ever studied. The emotional consequences of prostitution are the same in widely varying cultures. Whether it’s high-class or low-class. Whether it’s legal or illegal, whether it’s in a brothel, strip club, massage parlor, or the street. Symptoms of emotional distress in all forms of prostitution, are off the charts. Depression, suicidality, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, dissociation… Two thirds of the women we interviewed, and all of the people we interviewed in prostitution, two thirds of them had PTSD at the same level of the most emotionally traumatized groups ever studied by psychologists. That would be combat vets, women who had just been raped, women seeking shelter from batterers, and also state-sponsored torture survivors. What’s wrong with sex is what johns themselves tell us about it. For example, if you look at it, it’s paid rape. She has to do what you want. I use them like I might use any other amenity, a restaurant, or a public convenience. It’s like renting an organ for ten minutes. In research interviews with johns, we found that their abuse of women extended to women who had not been prostituted yet. The johns that bought the most women in prostitution were the most likely to commit sexually coercive acts with non-prostituting women. When women are turned into objects that men masturbate into, it causes immense psychological harm to the person acting as a receptacle. Please don’t be fooled by people who tell buying sex is just another job.it’s wrong to set aside a special class of women, those who are the most vulnerable among us, for men’s sexual use. What’s wrong with paying for sex is it’s the business of sexual exploitation. Thanks."

    "data":"This is a very serious matter, and to take it seriously, I propose we start by looking at human diversity. Consider an example, you're a nineteen year old American soldier, and you’ve been drafted to fight the Nazis in France, and you have, to put it bluntly, never done it before. And before the event of a big battle, you go and you buy sex from a Frenchwoman who maybe needs the money to feed her kids. Or maybe you're a young man and you have sexual problems, and you hire a sexual surrogate to help you with those problems, and you go on to have a loving and successful marriage. Or maybe you're a handicap person who, for whatever reasons finds that a better way to achieve sexual ends is to pay for sex. These are all examples of the diversity of the human condition. What the other side is neglecting is this diversity, a diversity of individuals, a diversity of situations, a diversity of cultures. If you look at the broad sweep, the history of mankind, there’s a big, long book by Nils Ringdahl on the history of prostitution. He looks at Medieval India, he looks at the Tang Dynasty, he looks at Renaissance courtesans, and what you find is a wide variance of outcomes. You find a lot of cases where things go fine, and you find a lot of cases where things don’t go fine. I propose what we have here is a human activity which very frequently is badly regulated, and when it is badly regulated, you will see massive amounts of abuse, unfairness, exploitation. And I recognize the other side in pointing out these abuses. But the problem is that it is a badly regulated activity. There are many, many cases, three of which I’ve outlined, where consenting adults meet, they meet voluntarily, both of them are better off, and buying of the sex is not wrong. All of the abuses listed by the other side you can find in another institution called marriage. If you go around the world and go to poorer cultures and ask within marriage how often is there rape, how often is there abuse, exploitation, unequal terms all the way down the line, women who are too young to be married, you see this happen all the time. But to go back to our resolution, the correct answer is not to condemn marriage, to say that marriage is wrong. In a way you can think of prostitution as a bit like, dare I say, banking. As we know here in New York, banking is very frequently badly regulated. And you find in many countries, believe it or not right here in Manhattan, you find examples of abuses, fraud, exploitation in banking. But again, the correct attitude or answer is not to say that all banking is wrong. There’s simply a category error being made by the other side in this debate. And again, think back to your core intuitions, there are many, many cases, millions, billions of cases in human history where informed, consenting adults have gotten together and someone has bought sex from another person. And again, I am submitting that these cases are not wrong. Go take a look at New Zealand, where prostitution is legal. It has been legal since 2003. The other side didn't mention New Zealand at all. There’s a big long report written by the New Zealand government about how this experiment has gone. Uh, there’s a lot of evidence that it’s actually gone pretty well. A survey of the prostitutes revealed that seventy-three percent of them do it to pay household expenses, twenty-four percent of them are doing it to pay for education, thirty-eight percent are doing it to help out their children, or support an older family member, and the rates of abuse, coercion, and rape, the rate of rape is extremely low. It seems to be lower in prostitution than in a lot of other settings. But again, these are not the examples you're hearing. The point, again, that I'm stressing is this diversity, that when you have consenting adults there are, again, many cases where it’s simply possible that it is a okay thing to do. There are many other sectors of the economy that we can look at. If you ask the Bureau of Labor Statistics, what is the most dangerous job in the United States, at least according to the bureau, it’s being a fisherman and going out on a fishing boat. It’s an extremely hazardous occupation. There’s a lot of loss of life, loss of limb, people being crippled, unfair conditions, illegal immigrants who work under conditions that are not right. And again, these are real problems. But to think of it in terms of morality, we ask, what is the moral issue here? The moral issue is when you have unsafe fishing boats, or when fishing is not regulated properly, or when we as society don’t think about fishing and industrial safety in all the right ways. No one thinks to say fishing is wrong, buying fish is wrong, fishing boats are wrong. Again, it is simply this category error. I would even submit that if we take the point of view suggested by the opposition, the more we try to blackball, ban, condemn an activity that we all know has existed in every society, it always pops up, there is always a black market, there are many different ways of trading sex. It is not going away. If there’s one thing that we all should realize in this room, is that the buying of sex is not going away. What we want is that it happen in a better way rather than a worse way. We need to have a constructive attitude. I do not hear that constructive attitude from the other side. What I hear is an attitude that will put this practice under a greater veil of secrecy, it will make it harder for the people who are selling to go to the law when they have problems, it will make it more of a social disgrace, and it will worsen the problems with the working conditions rather than improve it. I’d also note, just as an aside, just how culturally-bound and institution specific the complaints are. For instance, in Melissa Farley’s presentation, it’s always man and woman, man buying from woman. There’s no talk of gay prostitution, there’s not much talk of the broader sweep of human history, of practices of dowries, of the numerous tribes in human history who have taken very different attitudes than that which we hold. In fact, if you polled the majority of human beings over time, the most likely answer you're going to hear is that the people who are doing something wrong are the men who are trying to get sex without paying for it simply by seducing the woman. Anyway, thank you all."

    "data":"What I know about prostitution I know from the prostituted women that I work for, representing them because they asked me to. We have found the sanctimoniousness and the superiority of the moral position against prostituted people, that is that they are bad, to be insulting and insufferable. And we have also found the rescue impulse to be demeaning and typically ineffective. But, no one opposes the normal business of prostitution for money, that is of sex for money, more, or more eloquently than the women who really know what it is because they're living it. That is the women who are living in this industry, most of whom are trafficked by international definition, because they are being pimped. And they want to get out, and they can't. Thus fitting the international definition of slavery. When you want to get out of marriage there’s a term called divorce. Eighty-five percent of women, when asked what they most want, that is women in prostitution, say what they want is to get out, but they don’t know how to. Usually they got in as children. Normally they got in as children. The majority. They were, most of them, sexually abused, actually, even before that. This is in the ninety percent plus range. That is, they were treated as a thing for sex before they ever had a chance to become a person first. And usually they are women, meaning their economic options are limited already by sex discrimination, precluding a vast majority of what men do for better pay, leaving, for the women who end up in prostitution the one remaining thing to be called her choice. This is a myth that one woman described for herself as, to be able to get out I had to believe I chose to get in. Sex, when it’s right, like friendship, is its own reward, it’s mutual, it’s equal in its diversity. You can't buy the real thing. In prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with. The money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. It acts like physical force does in rape. And as Kathleen Barry put it, the only difference between rape and prostitution is time, one ends, the other doesn't. And then she is stigmatized and deprived of dignity by society, and criminalized by the legal system. So for her, what’s wrong with it is, it’s abusive, it’s intimately violative, it’s destructive, it’s damaging, it’s dangerous, it’s exploitative, and it’s unequal. It’s up to you to decide if this is right or wrong. We're not here, actually, to discuss the proposition it’s wrong to be paid for sex.” We are here to discuss the proposition, it is wrong to pay for sex.” I’ve just been talking about what’s wrong with it for her. What’s wrong with it for him is, he’s using her, he’s exploiting her, he’s exploiting his inequality to her, which is usually a desperate economic inequality. In order to have access to her person in a form of bodily invasion, while he gets off on the illusion that he has chosen this freely, when he is taking more than can ever be paid for. And what he is buying is not only that chunk of her humanity called self-respect… And it isn't sex only, it’s you do what I say, sex. Now, to be against this is why those of us who are today supporting this proposition support the Swedish model. In this model, the seller is, well, the buyer is strongly criminalized. The seller has, is also strongly criminalized. In criminalizing the person who is the one who’s buying the sex, you are criminalizing the one that my desperately poor Indian clients, from India, call the real criminal. And you de-criminalize the sold. You couple this with real education, real employment opportunities, real jobs, real money. Women are entitled to real equality and real choices. Men presumably also need to pay for household expenses to put themselves through school, and you don’t find them, in general, not in anything like the numbers you find women, selling themselves on street corners. Women need real equality and real choices. We're asking you to vote yes for the proposition as a way to weigh in on the side of the view that women and children are not for sale. And I'm going to reserve the balance of my time for my rebuttal."

    "data":"Thank you. Freud once asked the question, what do women want? And I would argue that what women want is their own money. And I have heard a lot of stories about, some really horrifying stories about young girls, people being trafficked, as Lionel said, this is just something, I mean I want them to throw away the key on these people. But what’s interesting is some of the statistics that I’ve been hearing, because what’s interesting is the only people that you can get these statistics from are the people at the very, very bottom, and they constitute a very small percentage of all of the working girls, at least in the United States. I cannot speak for anywhere else. And because I have to tell you that I don’t recognize any of the kinds of clients that the opposition has talked about, I don’t recognize any of the kinds of girls that the opposition has talked about, so let me tell you a little bit about the experiences that I had, and that because I know so many people all over the United States that run escort services, or that have worked as working girls. There’s tens of hundreds of thousands of them. And let me tell you a little bit about a story. First of all, who’s really taking advantage of who? I would argue that it is the women taking advantage of the men’s need for us. After all, who ends up with the money? We do. Who’s the one who sets the price? We do. They're the ones who shell out because they want what we have. And if they don’t want to pay it, then they don’t get it. I mean, that's, it’s as simple as that. So, I just, and by the way, can I just say that building an ugly building affects millions of people over hundreds of years, so……so I didn't feel bad… But that was something just, she’s right, it absolutely offended me. I just, there’s some, a lot of ugly buildings out there. So let me tell you about some of the gals who worked for me, and who are fairly, this is the, first of all, most of them are students. I did not hire anyone under the age of nineteen, no one I know, and I know dozens and dozens of madames, ever hires girls under the age of eighteen. Never. I only took forty percent of the young lady’s earnings, and they wanted to give that money to me. They didn't have to. But, I took the phone calls, I'm the one who set it up, I'm the one who checked them out, I'm the one who made sure they got the money if for some reason, you know, at the end of the evening he didn't pay, I would still pay her. And can I tell you something, in five and a half years, you should pardon the expression, we never once got stiffed. And we got… And we got the money at the end. So you know, they use the word pimp, and I'm not saying that there aren't people out there that, that really fit that description, that aren't horrible people, but we’re not all like that. So, let me tell you about Colby. Colby was the daughter of a doctor, and she was used to living a very privileged life. She was in medical school, and she had several siblings who were either in college or medical school or law school or whatever. And Colby had a thing for, you know, beautiful clothes, six hundred dollar boots is actually the example she gave to me. And she came to work for me because she felt guilty asking her father, who had so many other, you know, of her siblings in school, to give her six hundred dollars for a pair of boots. This was Colby’s choice. But this is the reason she worked for me, so that she could have six hundred dollar boots. Sandy was a singer in a rock and roll band, and she and her band had finally broken through and had gotten a, a tour put together. And about three months before they were supposed to go on tour someone broke into the van and stole all their equipment. This was their chance to really be someone and really make it, and so everyone went to work doing something else, and Sandy came to work for me. You hear, and most of the girls, as I said before, were students. And the way I used to look at it is, here were the girls’ dreams on this side of the river. They wanted to be models, actresses, dancers, singers, they wanted a degree, they want, I had girls who wanted to be nurses, I had girls who wanted to be all different kinds of things. And, so this is their dream on this side of the gulch. And here they were over here, and they needed the money to pay the toll to the bridge to get to the other side so that they could have the life that they wanted. And they decided, and they could have done anything else, they decided that they wanted to do this. And it was their choice. And I know it’s going to, a lot of people are going to find this offensive, but I don’t think there’s one single solitary girl that worked for me who didn't come back after the very first time and say, I can't believe it was so easy. I can't believe I didn't do this before. I know, I know this is offensive to some people, but I mean, may a lightning bolt come down, this is what they said. And with respect to the guys, I mean, you should, we had terrific, we had a little Saudi prince who… who wanted to have pillow fights, because when he was a kid he never got to have pillow fights. We had workaholics who had no time for a personal life, especially back in the early eighties, we had currency traders who, you know, were awake at all different times. They didn't have time for a girlfriend. Women weren't going to put up with guys who were never around. I mean, these were guys that women pay thousands of dollars to join these matchmaking services in order to meet. They were people who were between relationships, they wanted a sure thing. There were lonely travelers. There’s a lot of guys out there who were on the road, you know, week after week after week. They just want a little company. Now, when you figure that, we euphemistically call it the nitty-gritty, only lasted maybe five, seven, eight minutes, and yet the clients kept the young ladies for one hour, two hour, three hours, four hours. What were they really paying for? If they, all they wanted was the sex, believeme, they could have gotten it for a hell of a lot less, we charged top dollar, that that’s not all that they pay for. A lot of them pay for the company, they pay because they just, they want a pretty girl to talk to and to have a good time with. I had a couple clients who had invalid wives who felt that it was cheating if they had a girlfriend, but they still had needs that they needed to have met. So, while it is true that there are a lot of bad people out there doing bad things to girls, I think to say that all of these girls are abused, that all of these girls are taken advantage of, that they're all traumatized, yes, there are some, but it’s certainly not the majority, and I, believe me, I want them to throw away the key on these people too. But, I think to tar everyone with the same brush is just not being realistic, because there are a lot of good people out there who are doing this. And to criminalize these girls, and to give them records so that they can't go and live a normal life just to me doesn't seem right."

    "data":"Thank you very much, John. Two principles require that we stop welcoming undocumented immigrants, otherwise known as illegal aliens – respect for the rule of law and respect for facts on the ground. The ongoing violation of our immigration laws has reversed the traditional roles in a sovereign nation. It is now people living outside our border who determine our immigration policy, not Americans. The facts that result from this constant violation are these: a significant portion of the children of illegal Mexicans and Central Americans are adopting an underclass culture, as anyone can verify for himself by looking at social statistics or spending time in heavily Hispanic schools. Until we figure out how to prevent this from happening our unrestricted immigration flows guarantee social problems for years into the future. Now, on paper, our elected representatives continue to make our immigration rules. In reality, however, the power to determine who comes into the country and on what conditions, the most basic attribute of sovereignty, has passed from Congress to the world at large. A net half million aliens enter the country illegally each year. Once inside, they have enjoyed virtual immunity from any risk of penalties, as well as receiving a host of taxpayer benefits. Such immunity is now considered an entitlement. Any hint of enforcement, no matter how limited, inevitably provokes a massive outcry from immigrant advocates and immigrants themselves, that the government is behaving unfairly and, indeed, unlawfully. Disapproving headlines will blare from newspapers across the country. Quote: Fear among immigrants spreads, unquote. Mexican Consul Generals will complain bitterly that the government is psychologically abusing their countrymen by causing them to worry about their status. It seems that not only ill…do illegal aliens have the right to live here without being deported, they also have the right to live without thinking that they face even a minimum risk of being deported. This sense of entitlement does a great injustice to the thousands of law-abiding foreigners who are patiently waiting to enter the country legally. And it makes a mockery of our laws. I would like to ask our esteemed opposing team if they think that anyone should ever be deported for coming into the country illegally or whether they believe that once across the border he should be home free. Now, you may hear from Mr. Griswold tonight that our immigration laws are economically unwise. I and my colleagues vehemently disagree. But even if it were the case that controlling the border was bad economic policy, the sanctity of the law does not rest on whether it meets someone’s idea of optimal economic efficiency. Until the American people decide to change the law it should be respected and enforced. You may also hear tonight that we have tried immigration enforcement and that it has failed and therefore that we have no choice other than to allow the present inflood to continue. In fact, until a few months ago, there has been almost no immigration enforcement in the interior of the country. In 2004 a mere three firms were issued fine notices for employing illegal aliens out of the hundreds of thousands of such law-breaking employers across the country. To be sure, the country has progressively put more agents on the border. But once an illegal alien got across the border he entered a three million square mile sanctuary zone. This means that mass deportation is not required to revive the effectiveness of our immigration laws. The illegal population has burgeoned precisely because illegals assume they face absolutely no risk of enforcement, as the complaints about psychologically harassing illegal aliens with de minimis enforcement show. Increase that risk even slightly and calculations change. After 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security deported fifteen hundred illegal Pakistanis living in, in New York, leading fifteen thousand more to leave on their own. A modest increase in enforcement would result in a similar reduction over time of the broader illegal alien population. The second principle supporting tonight’s motion is respect for facts on the ground. Those facts show that unrestrained illegal immigration is producing an underclass culture among many children of Hispanic illegal aliens. Talk to students in any heavily Latino school and you’ll hear something like this – told to me by an undocumented Guatemalan girl in Los Angeles – Quote: Most of the students I hung out with when I started school have dropped out. Others got kicked out or got into drugs. Five graduated and four homegirls got pregnant. This testimony is perfectly representative. Hispanics now have the highest teen pregnancy rate in the country. Moreover, fifty percent of Hispanic children are born out of wedlock, a rate two times that of whites and three times that of Asians. The stigma against unmarried child-rearing among teens has virtually disappeared. Hispanics have the highest school dropout rate in the country – fifty percent. And gang life is sucking in large numbers of Latino youth. The incarceration rate of Mexican-Americans jumps eightfold between the first and second generation, resulting in an incarceration rate three and a half times that of whites. Gang counselors in schools from Washington, D.C. to San Diego despair at the fact that younger and younger kids are joining gangs. To be sure, most Hispanic immigrants are industrious strivers who seize every opportunity available to them. But as long as many of the children are assimilating into the underclass and adopting its values, maintaining the current high levels of illegal entry will bring in its wake rising welfare and crime. In conclusion, we should continue to welcome legal immigrants who have respected American law from the moment they entered the country and in the way they entered it. But it is an insult to them to accord the same privileges to so-called undocumented immigrants who have chosen to flout the law. And it is not in the country’s self-interest to do so. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Well, thank you, everybody, for coming out tonight. Uh, first I want to lodge a protest at the, uh, proposition that we’re debating. It’s a little bit like, uh, Have you stopped beating your wife?, kind of question. I don’t think anybody up here is thrilled about having illegal immigrants in the United States. Our side would like to see them able to come legally. And I’d like you to think of the motion as, uh, Let’s Stop Welcoming More Legal Immigration. And I’d urge you to vote against it. Immigrants have made the United States a prosperous, dynamic and free country. They have throughout our history, they continue to do so today – both on the higher end of the skills spectrum – but I will argue tonight that low-skilled immigrants are also benefiting the United States. There are two powerful economic and demographic trends, two very positive ones, that are driving lowskilled immigration to the United States. On the demand side, our economy continues to create hundreds of thousands of net new jobs every year for low-skilled workers in fields like retail, cleaning, landscaping, food preparation. And at the same time, the supply of Americans who traditionally filled these jobs – Americans without a high school diploma – has been dropping steadily. We’re getting older, we’re getting better educated. Uh, less than ten percent of Americans, adult Americans, do not have a high school diploma, compared to fifty percent in the early 1960s. 4.6 million fewer Americans are in the work force without a high school diploma today than just a decade ago. So we have a, a structural mismatch between demand and supply in our economy. And yet there’s no legal channel for a peaceful, hardworking twenty-four year old Mexican or Central American to come into the United States legally and fill these jobs that there are simply not enough Americans, uh, there to fill. And yes, we have tried enforcement and it’s failed. We have ramped up real spending on enforcement six-fold in the last two decades, line watch hours at the border eight-fold. We’ve built walls for miles into the desert. We have gone through periods of increased interior enforcement in the late Nineties and now again. It has made no dent. Enforcement without reform is doomed to fail. It has failed in the past and it continues to fail. You know, we rounded up a few thousand, uh, workers at a chicken processing plant, uh, in Georgia a while back. You know, two thousand down, eight million to go. It’s a futile exercise. There have been perverse consequences. Because of our enforcement those trying to get in are actually, uh, more successful because they’re going through more remote regions in the desert. It’s more dangerous. The death rate has tripled. Three or four hundred people are dying every year for the crime of wanting a better job and trying to cross the border. And here’s the irony: once they’re in they’re more likely to stay. Because of the expense and risk of crossing the border once they’re in they tend to stay. Traditionally we’ve had a strong circular component to Mexican migration. Eighty percent of them who came here eventually went back home, uh, as temporary immigrants. And we’ve interrupted that now and I think a legalization program would restore that circular flow. The only answer is immigration reform. We need to change the law. This is a broken, dysfunctional law. We need to change the law. You know, uh, and I think we need to both create a temporary worker program and legalize those who are here. We’re not talking amnesty. They would pay a fine, they would serve probation. That’s the penalty for a misdemeanor. It’s not a felony. It’s not a crime to be here. It’s a civil infraction. The punishment should fit the crime. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, of course, did, did none of that. Uh, but the missing piece was that it had no temporary worker program, no provision for legalizing future workers, and it failed. Let’s not make that mistake again. Back in the 1950s we had a problem with illegal immigration. We had the Bracero Program but the Visas were insufficient. We dramatically increased the Visas and illegal immigration dropped by ninety-five percent. Our side’s not talking about letting in more immigrants. We’re talking about turning in a flow of illegal and a population of illegal immigrants into a legal flow and population of i…of immigrants. You’ll hear the argument from the other side that this is bad for low-skilled Americans. Well, if you’re twentyfive years old and you don’t have a high school diploma you’re getting it from all sides. The best thing you can do is stay in school. You’ll get a thirty-eight percent raise just over somebody who’s dropped out. So it’s, the answer isn’t to build walls. It’s to encourage people to stay in school. You’ll hear about the fiscal and social costs and you’ve already heard that. Uh, I just don’t see it. Yes, low-skilled workers tend to consume more in government services than they pay in taxes, but I think the other side exaggerates those costs. The costs are manageable. We can control access to the welfare state. And they’re overwhelmed by the economic benefits to having a more, uh, expansive, uh, dynamic economy. The social costs: You know, Heather talked about this swelling underclass. I just don’t see it. In the last decade the poverty rate is down in the United States. Cri…crime is down by a third from the early 1990s – and this is with a doubling of the illegal immigrant population. The number of U.S. households headed by somebody without a high school diploma has dropped by more than ten percent, uh, in the last decade. So we have a shrinking underclass, uh, in this country and immigrants are helping to create, uh, opportunities throughout our economy. The answer, my friends, is to fence off the welfare state, not to fence off our country. Let me end by talking a little bit about national security. And I don’t need to remind people in New York how important that is. None of us want to see a repeat of September 11th. I think a sensible immigration reform program would enhance our security and bring order to the border. This is a very important thing. We would begin to drain the swamp of smuggling and document fraud that can facilitate, uh, terrorism. We’d encourage people to come forward, announce themselves to authorities, to cooperate, uh, with the police rather than living in the shadows and being afraid. And also we would free up resources to go after the real criminals and terrorists. Uh, I think that’s one reason why our Homeland, uh, Security boss, uh, Michael Chertoff, has been such a strong supporter of immigration reform. It would make his job easier. As he told Congress recently, uh, Immigration reform would, quote, dramatically reduce the pressure on our borders, aid our economy and ease the task of our law enforcement agents inside the country. What in the world is our Homeland Security Department doing using its scarce resources going after janitors and dishwashers and meat packers when it should be going after criminals and terrorists? We need to stop wasting our dollars, manpower and lives in a futile effort to close our borders and turn away hardworking, peaceful immigrants. We need to change the law – so that our country can welcome more legal immigrants to help us grow. And let me just end with a world about the rule of law. I’m all for enforcing the law. I’m all for obeying the law. But the law must be reasonable. It must be consistent with how normal people live their lives. In the 1930s we had alcohol prohibition. It made criminals out of millions of people who just wanted a drink after dinner. The American frontier was settled by illegal squatters and instead of clearing them off we passed the Homestead Act. Uh, we need to change the law so that our immigration law better reflects our needs as an economy, our need for a more secure nation and our highest values. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Thank you very much. It’s a pleasure to be here. Please don’t let the other side confuse you. This is not about legal immigration. There’s a difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration. The topic tonight, which the vote is supposed to be on, is illegal im…immigration -- undocumented workers, if you want to call them that – but illegal immigration. That’s the issue and that’s the principle that I’m, uh, uh, that I’m in favor of stopping. Ille…And there are three reasons, basically. And I want to elaborate on each in a moment. The first is that illegal immigration is not a victim…victimless crime. There are people who lose and lose in big ways. And these are the most vulnerable people in our society – not the privileged, not the well-off, who…whom government is suppo…does a very, a pretty good job of protecting – but the most vulnerable, the unskilled, the poorly educated, the poorly trained, disproportionately youth, disproportionate minority, disproportionately women who bear the, the competition with illegal immigrants. And they’re hurt very badly. Just because some people win and other people lose doesn’t mean it’s on average, nothing happens. It’s a very, it has a very detrimental impact on those who lose. Secondly, and I to go back and talk about a moment, illegal immigration does erode one of the basic pillars of this society – the, the rule of law. And when we make mockeries of our laws we br…we, we engender, we, we, we encourage cynicism about the society in which we live in. What’s the sense of passing laws if nobody obeys them? And lastly, I want to talk about the fact that illegal immigration exposes in a very obvious way the seamier side of our wonderful democracy. Uh, the willingness of some to tolerate the exploitation of human beings, uh, in our society, to find some ways to rationalize it. And the failure to stop this, these sores allows them then to, to fester and make conditions in this country much worse. It breeds cynicism about what our really core values of this nation are. But before I elaborate on those I want to say briefly how I got involved with this. I was invi…I became involved in this when I was a very young professor teaching at the University of Texas, when a man named Cesar Chavez came through Austin on the way to try to organize farm workers in south Texas in 1966. And I joined with that movement and I went down to the border for the first time. I was not a Texan. I saw the border and I knew right away that the first day I was on the picket line that this strike was lost. We were overwhelmed by strike breakers and I’m saying to this day those, those people are still not organized in south Texas. And, uh, from those years in the Sixties and Seventies there was no greater spokesman for ending illegal immigration in this country than Cesar Chavez, who sued the Carter Administration for, uh, for its unwillingness to enforce immigration laws before we even had employer sanctions. Just trying to say these people shouldn’t be in here. That was Chavez’s line. And he believed it very strongly in those days when he was actively trying to organize farm workers. And he certainly made a big impression on me for the rest of my life. It’s also the case that I believe the position that we’re arguing is supported by the overwhelming balance of re…of research and findings about the adverse impact of illegal immigration on individuals and on our society. I want to elaborate on the three points now. First of all, with respect to adverse impact, there are ninety million – in a newspaper article just in last week’s Ithaca Journal – ninety million people that are adults in a population in the United States who only have only a high school diploma or less – ninety million. That’s half of the adult population of the entire country. Of that number, fifty million are in the civilian labor force. Almost one-third of the labor force doesn’t, has only a high school diploma or less. The problem this country faces, as this article makes, discusses very clearly, is that we have an over-supply of unqualified people in the country. It’s not that we have a shortage of unskilled workers that we need undocumented workers. And that over-supply is the group that are so adversely affected by illegal immigration. Those are the people overwhelmingly who are adversely affected in terms of their wage depression and limited opportunities. They’re the ones who have to compete with illegal immigration, immigrants for jobs. Uh, and that’s the ones we should, would be concerned with – the people that had the highest unemployment rates. The highest unemployment rates in the United States are those people in the high school grades, or high school-less, uh, uh, uh, cohort. Uh, the unemployment rate is, is over, it’s almost six percent for people without high school diplomas and for those people in some groups, even blacks without high school diplomas, it’s all…it’s, it’s twelve percent right now. So it’s hard to make any argument that there is a great shortage of unskilled workers when the highest unemployment rates in the United States are held by those who have the lowest level of education. Just what we’d expect, but the other side makes it out as if there’s a great shortage of unskilled workers in this country that would document, that would, uh, warrant the, uh, the coming of undocumented workers. That is absolutely not true. Absolutely not true. This, uh, this labor market is in surplus and that’s the problem. Why income levels at the bottom, uh, don’t go up, wages at the bottom don’t go up, why income distribution in this country is coming, uh, increasingly skewed, heading toward greater inequality. It’s, uh, and it’s, it’s a very dangerous thing for a society to have happen to it. Uh, we all know that if undocumented workers were pouring into the professional and legal ranks of this country, if they were coming into the professor ranks or the lawyer ranks or the doctors’ ranks or the business executive ranks, this issue would have been solved a long time ago. We all understand very clearly that this, uh, that the undocumented workers coming into the legal profession or the doctors’ profession five hundred thousand a year, was not good for the doctors in this country or the lawyers in this country who have to invest, uh, invest in their education and training and the, all the rest of it to get to those positions. Undocumented, not legal immigrants, but undocumented, illegal immigrants. But somehow when it comes to low-wage workers, low-skilled workers, farm workers, maids, yardmen and all the rest of these things – landscapers and restaurant employees and hotel employees – people forget about the laws of economics – that, uh, that, that, uh, increasing the supply of those workers when you have unemployment already, of high unemployment rates already in those markets, can only depress wages and working conditions and make conditions worse for those at the bottom of our society, and society. So, again, this is the first reason. Uh, illegal immigrants will always win in the competition for jobs. They become preferred workers. It’s not that U.S. citizens will not do these jobs. Employers don’t want them. Illegal immigrants will always work for the longest hours, the lowest pay or the worst working conditions because no matter how bad conditions are in this country, they’re infinitely better than they are in the countries that they came from. Remember, two billion people on this planet today earn less than two dollars a day. Two billion – half of all the workers in the world today. That’s what they make. So any condition in this country is way better than what they have had from most of the countries that they’ve come from. So in the competition for jobs they will always be a preferred worker if employers can have them. My view is they should not be allowed to have access to that supply of labor. That is a, that, that – and that’s what our law says, that’s what our law requires. It’s just we don’t enforce our laws. Secondly, the, the issue of, of, of the rule of law. Illegal immigrants, those who enter without inspection or overstay Visas are creating, are committing, uh, criminal misdemeanors. If they, if they over-stay their Visa – sorry, if they, if they’ve been deported and then come back in, it’s a felony offense. But we don’t enforce the laws. Uh, they get away, so there’s little risk, really in actually following any of those laws. Since, since 1986 illegal immigrants who come to the United States, um, uh, uh, are not required to work but they do work. Again, the laws that are not being enforced. I’m, I’m real, way behind, I guess, in what I wanted to say. It’s, uh, it’s illegal to use false documents, it’s illegal to, to use somebody else’s identity. It’s illegal to use someone’s else, the Social Security number. All those things have criminal offense but then nobody applies the laws. How many laws are these people of, uh, are entitled to violate without people becoming cynical about our rule of, our rule of law? Uh, uh, driver’s licenses, social services, all the rest of it. Um, uh, the last point I wanted to make was about the, about the, the fragileness of our democracy. Uh, this exposes the seamier side of it by, by allowing illegal immigration to go on. It gives tacit, uh, uh, approval to their presence in our society and to its human, its human smugglers and abusive employers and unsafe work environments. And all those things are, are, go hand in hand with illegal immigration. The result is to encourage millions to keep coming. Um, so that they – and it also -- Thank you. Much more to say."

    "data":"Thank you. Yeah. Buenos noches. Good evening. Shalom. I’m glad to be in, uh, beautiful New York City once again. I wanted to, uh, first of all, thank everybody here and, and for the invitation to share a few moments with you. It’s important that we discuss in a civil manner and, uh, that we talk about the truth about this immigration situation. And I want to find out in the audience, uh, how many Native Americans are here? How many hundred percent Native Americans that are indigenous, that could trace their roots to the tribes that were here thousands of years ago? You know, maybe I might be the only one but I’ve gotta admit, only my dad’s side of the family -- eight thousand years. And on my mom’s side of the family I can only go back to the 1600s. And so it’s just to kind of say that even though this is a great country and I love the United States – I’m a U.S. citizen. I was born and raised in San Diego – my family came from Mexico and it came like most Mexican families. It came legally. And it came, like most immigrants come to this country, looking for a better opportunity. And it was driven by economics. My dad’s job had an opportunity in San Diego and, and we moved to San Diego. And I was born in San Diego. It’s very important that we look back on the history of this great country. And I don’t think that we’ve had a lot of welcoming, uh, to immigrants, especially if you look at it from the Native American point of view or the people of color point of view. I don’t see very much diversity but we’re all the same race – the human race. And I think it’s important that we treat each other in such a manner. And Cesar Chavez was mentioned a, a moment ago. They’re one of our biggest supporters, the United Farm Workers. And I ask you in your prayers to pray for Elena Chavez who was diagnosed with colon can…cancer just a couple of days ago – Cesar Chavez’s wife. And, uh, they’re, they’re big supporters of our movement and they’ve helped us in, in the efforts that we’re continuing, to have more humane laws. Ethel Kennedy, uh, Robert Kennedy’s wife, is really the one that inspired me to come out of the shadows when we started our work as, as Border Angels back in 1986. And you’ll see some information on some flyers I have in the back for our all-volunteer organization. What we’re best known for is putting water in the desert – putting water in the desert to save people’s lives. But that’s not the only thing we do. We also were instrumental in the massive demonstrations last year which had three and a half million people take to the streets and say, We want humane and comprehensive immigration reform. We don’t want to have any more deaths on the border. We don’t want to have this hate radio and hate television that many of you are familiar with, that’s really sprung up in the last several years. Border Angels is a non-partisan faith based organization and our mar…what our mission statement says, If I was hungry did you give me to eat, if I was thirsty did you give me to drink? Period. In October of 1994 the United States government decided to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. We protested against this wall. What the government said it’s gonna stop the flow of migrants. And I said, Why would it stop the flow of migrants? The United States invaded Mexico in 1846, took half its territory and there was a treaty that was signed – the Treaty of Guadalupe de Hidalgo – where people were supposed to be able to go back and forth, freely. That was never honored. But there’s nobody alive today that was there when the United States invaded Mexico in 1846. What country has not committed sins? Every country. Every country has racist, every country has people that misinform the public. So let’s stick to the facts. And I want to tell you a couple of stories. In October of 1994 the government put up this wall, called Operation Gatekeeper. And it’s been estimated by the flyer that I have in the back that four thousand five hundred people have died in the last thirteen years. And that’s an estimate, according to the Border Patrol. But I think the number is closer to ten thousand people. It, whether it’s four thousand, five hundred or ten thousand, people should not be dying because they’re coming here for a better opportunity. Lucretia Dominguez was one of those people. She crossed with two of her children, Jesus and Nora. Jesus, a fifteen year old little boy and Nora, a seven year old little girl. She crossed from Sonora to Arizona. And she crossed the only way she could because poor people cannot get Visas. So when people tell you, Why don’t they just get in line? – What line? There is no line. So she crossed. She crossed with an unethical smuggler, like many of them are – and we’re opposed to that, of course – and a group of migrants. And what happened was, they ran out of water. The smugglers said, You’re slowing us down. You gotta cross on your own… They left, she left her behind with two of her children. She literally died in the arms of Jesus, her fifteen year old son. And her sister, his sister Nora was watching this. Two children in the middle of the desert were wandering around with their dead mother there. Thank God the border patrol found them and sent them back to Mexico. Their grandfather, Cesario, who is from Zacatecas, says, I don’t want to leave my daughter out there. So he went out looking for his daughter. He found one body, another body, another body before he found the body of his daughter. So if Cesario can find three other bodies, how many bodies are out there? We think it’s approximately ten thousand people that have died. Not only men, but also children. Marco Antonio Viasenor [PH] – he died. He was a five year old little boy. And when he ran out of water he asked his dad for water. But his dad didn’t answer him. So he asked seventeen other men. They didn’t answer him. Cause all eighteen men had died, including Marco Antonio Viasenor, in the back in the back of a semi-truck in Victoria, Texas. This is the real story of what’s happening right now. It’s inhumane and we can do better than that as a people. We are a great people and we are a great nation. There’s a lot of myths and mis…misinformation that’s out there. And we’ve heard some hateful terms, even in the discussion today -- sucking in, homegirl. This type of terminology to dehumanize people is unacceptable. Jose Luis Cisneros was attacked by three American kids – a hate crime, which is at an all time high right now in the United States. We see the vigilante groups, like the Minute Men, which President Bush has called vigilante, uh, hate groups. Today is like yesterday. Second and third generation immigrants and half of them are not from Mexico. It was referred to Mexican immigrants. Half of the undocumented people are not from Mexico. They come from other parts of the world for economic opportunity. They assimilate. They learn the language, just like your, like you did in, in the, in the many years that you’ve been here. There was a man that said, They’re not learning the language, they’re not assimilating. They want to just practice their own culture. We gotta stop them. [That man was Benjamin Franklin, talking about the Germanization of the United States. This has been going on for many, many years. There’s two hundred million plus undocumented people in the world. Only four percent of them live in the United States and of those twelve million, a third of them came here legally and their Visas expired – work, tourist or student Visas. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s in that category. Maybe we should have sent him back. But then there’s eight million other people that cannot get a Visa. These are poor people looking for a better economic opportunity and they’re sacrificing everything coming across the border. Ninety percent of them come for economic reasons, ten percent come from fam…for family reunification. They already have a relative living here. As Dan mentioned, it’s an economic plus, the undocumented people in this country. They’ll tell you that schools and hospitals are closing. They are. We need health care reform, we need educational reform. But don’t blame the migrants. It’s easy to blame the most vulnerable sector of society. Four percent of the world’s population lives in the United States -- three hundred million people – yet we consume over twenty percent of the world’s natural resources, fifty percent of the world’s illegal drugs. We have thirty percent – of the world’s population, uh, uh, environmental damage is caused by American companies. We could do better than that. Crime, the Department of Justice issued a study in which undocumented people are less prone to commit crime and less violent. Criminals are lazy people. Why are they going to cross a border to commit crime? It’s legal versus illegal. If we use that premise all the time we would still have slavery, women could not vote, we’d still have children working in factories. We need to build bridges of communication and triple fences of su…se…of separation. What good is it if we gain the whole world but lose our souls? There’s three and a half million people that have marched for immigration reform. Your grandchildren are going to ask you one day, What did you do when they were raiding families at three in the morning, when, when two people were dying every day crossing the border? The whole world is watching. Do the right thing. We need humane and comprehensive immigration reform. We’re a better country than that. We’re a better people than that. And it’s important that we practice what we preach. We should love our neighbor. And we were, when we were told to love our neighbor I’m sure it didn’t mean to kill ‘em. Thank you all and God bless you."

    "data":"Apparently I’m here to argue that we should not love our neighbor. But that won’t be the substance of my talk. Uh, the other side is claiming that, uh, the flow of people into the United States is inevitable, that it’s like the tides or continental drift and that we need to lie back and pretend to enjoy it. The fact, though, is that there’s nothing inevitable about, uh, the flow of people from abroad. It’s an artifact of government policy. The analogy they often use is to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit on an interstate and that it’s unnatural and therefore it has, that’s why people are violating the, uh, speed limit. The fact, though, is that an interstate highway is engineered for a particular speed. It’s designed for seventy mile an hour traffic -- the, uh, angles, the sightlines, the width of the shoulders. No economy, our economy is not engineered for any particular level of immigration. It can adapt to high levels of immigration, even higher than we have now. It can adapt to dramatically lower levels of immigration. The question is, what are the side effects, what are the consequences, what level of immigration do we want? Through our elected representatives we’ve made a decision – incoherent sometimes as it is – about what our legal immigration policy should be. Given what our legal immigration policy is it needs to be enforced, whatever it happens to be. If it’s changed, if the numbers are increased, decreased, what have you, the, the law needs to be enforced if it’s to mean anything. And there’s two ways you enforce immigration law. One is the conventional method of arresting and detaining and deporting people. We do that. We don’t really frankly do as much of that as, uh, you might think, but we do some of that and we need to do more of it. But at least as important, if not more important, is the other element of enforcement of any laws -- but specifically in immigration laws -- is to deter lawbreaking, to dissuade those abroad from sneaking in or overstaying their Visas and to encourage, especially the more recent illegal immigrants, to leave and go home. Um, and the welcome that we have, in fact, extended and been extending to illegal immigrants for many years now, uh, it subverts that second element of law enforcement. So what that means is we have two choices either focus even more on rounding up, arresting, detaining and deporting people, leaving that as our sole approach to enforce immigration law – or just give up enforcing immigration law and have de facto open borders – which, despite all the disclaimers, is what the other side wants. Now, um, just enforcing immigration law in the conventional way – border patrol agents, uh, immi…uh, immigration agents inside the country raiding work places and homes – relying only on that kind of enforcement can’t work. Uh, we haven’t actually done all that much of it, uh, but however much we increase it, it can’t be the sole basis of our immigration enforcement approach. We need to have, uh, deterrence and what you might call encouraging voluntary compliance. After all, the IRS doesn’t arrest everybody. It doesn’t, it isn’t in everybody’s, uh, accountant’s office, making sure the rule, the, the forms are filled out properly. Uh, a few people are made examples of, and everyone else - most everyone else, uh, in our country remarkably compared to most places - complies with the law more or less, voluntarily. And so, what is it that we are doing? What is this welcome” that we are talking about? What does it consist of? What are we doing to essentially subvert enforcement of our own immigration laws? Some of these things you have already, um, you are familiar with, of course. Uh, Mr. Rosenkranz referred to, uh, Governor Spitzer’s rule on driver’s licenses. Uh, the driver’s license is, in fact, our national ID system. And anything that makes it easy for illegal immigrants to get licenses, means it makes it easy for them to live here and to embed themselves in our society. Jobs. In 19… It was only in 1986 that the employment of illegal immigrants was prohibited by law. Before that, it was explicitly permitted in something called, not coincidentally, the Texas Proviso, where employers were held, uh, unaccountable for employing illegal immigrants. We did change it in 1986. But contrary to Dan’s claims, we have done nothing to enforce it in the past 20 years. Nothing. Bupkis. We have gone through sort of, uh, cabooky efforts at finding a few people, as Heather mentioned. Uh, in 2003 was the low point of enforcement. And three employers, in the entire United States, were fined for knowing employment of illegal immigrants. We don’t even do basic things like tell employers, that they have submitted a fake or stolen Social Security number, uh, from an illegal immigrant employer…uh, employee. And that matters, because the majority of illegal immigrants work on the books. They actually gave their employers a fake or a stolen Social Security number. We don’t even tell employers and hold them accountable for making sure that that information is correct. Another example of the welcome” we extend immigrants is, uh, bank accounts. The Treasury Department, just a couple of years ago…told banks inexplicitly, in writing…that it was OK for them to give bank accounts to illegal immigrants using, um, the Mexican government’s illegal alien ID card. That that was explicitly permitted by the law, and they shouldn’t, uh, be dissuaded from doing that. Um, another example. In-state tuition. Now, there is not that many illegal aliens going to state universities and getting, uh, in-state tuition subsidies. But symbolically, it’s very important. It is another part of the welcome” that we extend illegal immigrants, which subverts our efforts to make whatever our immigration policy is stick. What we really need in ending this welcome” is to pursue what I’d like to call a firewall” strategy. Make it not just difficult to get in the country, which is something we need to do, but also make it hard to gain access to the important institutions of our society…so that it becomes as difficult as possible to be an illegal immigrant. So you can’t get a driver’s license, you can’t get a job, etc. Only in that way can we successful dissuade new illegal immigrants from sneaking into the country, and persuade some significant portion of those to leave. That’s… I describe that as an attrition” policy. In other words, not magically eliminating the illegal immigration problem, but causing the illegal immigrant population…instead of growing every year, to start declining every year. It’s a realistic approach. It’s not a pipe dream. Heather mentioned the Pakistani illegal immigrants after 9/11. But, um, the New York Times and the USA Today just in the past couple of weeks have written about how the new, very modest but real, increasesc in immigration enforcement are in fact impelling significant numbers of people to get the message - that the party is over, and it’s time for them to go home. It works. Our research shows we could reduce the illegal population by half in five years, through normal law enforcement methods - not tattoos, not machine guns, not landmines - normal law enforcement, consistently applied. And that’s the key. Normal law enforcement, consistently applied. And not welcoming illegal immigrants with one hand, while we - in some instances - make it harder on the other hand. We need a consistent, unmixed message to illegal immigrants. And you’ll be surprised…"

    "data":"Thanks. Good evening. While superficially the topic tonight is about undocumented immigration,” the debate taking place in this country is really a deeper one. And it’s about whether immigrants - legal or not - are bad for America. And if you listen closely to Heather, it’s about whether Latino immigrants specifically are in fact destroying the fabric of our culture. Now, everybody here actually on stage agrees on one thing, and that is our current immigration system is broken. What we disagree about is what is broken about it, and how best to fix it. If you vote for us, it’s because you share our belief, that immigrants are in fact integral to who we are as America, and that they and their children are integral to the betterment and future of our country. Indeed, our core values as a nation are constantly renewed by immigrants, who come here seeking freedom and fairness, and opportunity for themselves and their families. The vibrancy and boldness of the youthful can do” attitude, the spirit of America, is refreshed by immigrants who have the courage, the strength and initiative to leave their homes and their loved ones - and in many cases, uh, as Enrique said - risk their lives to be part of the American Dream. Throughout our history, there have been people arguing that immigrants are taking jobs and failing to assimilate.” That immigrants from certain religious, ethnic or racial backgrounds are culturally unfit or unwilling to be Americans.” That they bring ignorance, poverty and disease, and threaten the dominance of English.” That’s what was said about the Know Nothings who argued about the Italians, the Irish, the Germans, the Jews, and even the Asians in the last century. And that’s what’s being said by the restrictionists today. Yet, in every case, immigrants and their children built businesses, they learned English, they joined the military - often in the face of discrimination against them, because of their religion or because of their race. Current immigrants are learning English even faster than the past - and are helping to drive the creation of small businesses here in New York and around the country. And as we stand here debating tonight, immigrants and their sons and daughters are in Afghanistan and Iraq, defending American values. And I am talking about immigrants who are not even yet citizens. Now, restrictionists have consistently been on the wrong side of history. And if you vote with them, it’s because - despite our long experience as a nation - you share their doubt about the power of American culture and American values. Rather than dealing with their very discomforting dislocations - and they are scary, brought about by globalization and the new Internet driven economy - it’s easier to blame immigrants and target them for their fears, as if, if they all went away, magically we wouldn’t have these new challenges. They hope to keep jobs in America by building high walls. And if we follow their old-school, isolationist prescription, America’s ability to generate jobs and compete in the global economy will fail. Before computers and the Internet maybe, and the globalization of corporations, it might have been possible to lock those jobs in. That’s no longer the case. Even agra business, is moving across borders, with American companies buying farmland in Mexico, because they can’t get the workers they need here in the U.S. And what about…? What does that mean in terms of our food security…that we can no longer fully feed ourselves? Vernon talked about class.” Well, it’s true that immigration challenges at all levels, actually. The American Bar Association magazine this month featured a story on the outsourcing of legal work to India. Because the reality is today, with the Internet, even if you keep immigrants out, it doesn’t mean that the jobs are staying here. All of us agree that a system which results in a huge number of undocumented… undocumented immigrants who are extremely vulnerable to the exploitation that the professor talked about, is not good. Because many restrictionists believe that immigrants are the root of these problems, their solutions tend to be reactionary policies that foster division, and actually backfire on communities and American citizens. I want to be clear. Despite the back and forth, we are not arguing for open borders, and we are not arguing that our laws should not be enforced. What we are saying is let’s be smart. Let’s talk about what laws need to change, so in fact they are enforceable and they make sense. Laws only function when they are humane. And right now, our immigration laws are not humane, and they do not make sense. As Dan said, we don’t provide a realistic number of visas or permanent green cards. The backlog for spouses and children to join with a legal permanent resident is now five to ten years. Is that smart? That’s why we have so many undocumented immigration. How many people would wait ten years to be with their spouse or child? The backlog for high-tech workers to get a green card, once they have already proven their value to our economy, is now five to seven years. The number of visas available for temporary, low-skilled workers is 5,000 a year. Now we could debate what the numbers should be. But I think most of you would find it strikingly unrealistic to say, that 5,000 is the right number. Restrictionists talk about attrition through raids and hostile policies. And what they really mean is making our community so uncomfortable that people who - as was pointed out by Mark - are finding much better wages here, are gonna be forced back across the border. We believe that it makes sense to reform the system to provide sufficient channels for legal entry, bring the current undocumented out of the shadows. Nobody really believes we can get 12 million out. And more vigorously enforce existing anti-discrimination, wage and hour, health and safety laws in the workplace. The restrictionists don’t talk about that. That is why undocumented get exploited. That’s why employers like to hire them. Because we are not enforcing the wage and hour, and health and safety. Ten years ago, there was one inspector of restaurants in New York for wage and hour. That is ridiculous. We can reduce incentives without punishing everybody. For example, what is going to happen now, Bush… The Bush administration is going to now require employers to match their Social Security numbers. And if you don’t… Uh, if you have a no match,” you have 30 days to clear it up. 30 days? The Inspector General of the Social Security Administration says, We have at least 17 million errors in the data.” There is only 12 million undocumented. So what does that mean? That means a lot of us……are gonna get caught up in that system. So what we are saying is, let’s have reasonable laws. Mark talks about licenses.” Well, we are not giving licenses to immigrants to help them. We are giving licenses because we would prefer that everybody driving on the road can get insurance and take the tests and know the rules of the road. By not providing them with licenses…with driver’s license, we are only punishing everybody else who is on the road with them. At bottom, the question is - do we really want to be the kind of community that refuses emergency health care to someone because they can’t produce a birth certificate or a green card? Do we want to be the kind of community like Riverside, New Jersey, that found that their economic revival of their downtown was reversed overnight when they decided it was best to pass hostile symbolic measures? And now Main Street is boarded up, and property values have tanked."

    "data":"Thank you. I’m intrigued by the Dating Game” idea so maybe we can return to that in the question part. It’s an evening event, everybody’s tired from work. To judge the motion, We must tolerate a nuclear Iran,” you must evaluate the alternatives to it. Ideally, the United States and other leading actors can prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Indeed, all six of us here agree emphatically that the U.S. and the international community must do everything possible, and more than has been done already, to try to prevent this. We all agree with that, we all work on that much of our time. We can talk about some of the steps that that might entail, including the United States being willing to engage in direct negotiations with Iran if Iran is willing to do so, which is a big question. We should talk about security guarantees to Iran, which Patrick has written about in the form of, We will not attack you if you don’t attack us.” We should right now be mustering Iran’s neighbors— perhaps secretly, some of it openly—into a much tighter, cohesive network to try to cooperate on intelligence, air monitoring, perhaps moving ballistic missile defenses into the region, to show Iran that its freedom of maneuver will be diminished if it moves forward with nuclear weapons. We have to be much more direct with President Putin in Russia. Russia is the biggest impediment of getting the Security Council to take strong actions, and we can talk about that later. The general point is, prevention, all of us agree, is the best option. Yet prevention is not the proposition we’ve been asked to debate here tonight. The question we are debating, is whether we can tolerate a nuclear Iran. That question assumes that diplomacy has failed, and we’re on to other options. Then we have to ask, well, what are the alternatives to tolerating an Iran that possesses nuclear weapons. Well, one might say, well, we kill ourselves. If we can’t tolerate, we kill ourselves. That’s not a good option. The second option will be, well, we’ll kill all of them. Make the problem go away. Also not a good option, there are 74 million of them, three times the population of Iraq. Even if somehow it were morally justifiable, it wouldn’t necessarily solve the problem. The most feasible strategy that is the alternative, the most feasible strategy for not tolerating a nuclear Iran, is an attack—a combination of attack on its known nuclear facilities, on its air force and navy to try to prevent its capacity to retaliate immediately, and on the Revolutionary Guard, to try to hasten regime change. This ought to be examined, and there are a long list of questions that arise from this. But the key thing in terms of the motion before us is, that you should not assume that this is a question of will power. In other words, if one says, I will not tolerate a nuclear Iran,” that somehow that solves the problem, that the will power to act—meaning to conduct a war—somehow achieves the objective of eliminating Iran’s nuclear capability. There’s no reason actually to conclude that it would—that even if you had the will, you could eliminate that capability. But you have to factor that in, as well as the consequences of a potential action. Now if I thought that a military attack of this type I described would actually eliminate that nuclear capability, and do it for a sufficient time, I would be for it, if the consequences of our attack were not going to leave us worse off. But to conclude that the consequences won’t leave us worse off, you have to ask a bunch of questions. To his great credit, Reuel Gerecht, our colleague, has written an essay last April in the Weekly Standard, that’s a very detailed treatment of a military option, which he ultimately advocates. Reuel talks about a campaign, a military campaign, that he says would be a series of actions and counter-actions between the U.S. and Iran, that would probably transpire over many years, perhaps a decade or more.” Now there’s a long list of questions that arise when you contemplate a war with Iran lasting a decade or more. You’d have to know if we buy some time, maybe two or three years, in the first attack, what happens. Well, the most likely thing that happens is the inspectors have to go, that’s been our major source of intelligence. So now when you want to figure out what else to attack over these years, your capacity actually to pinpoint things has diminished. The probability of hitting false targets, wrong targets, killing innocent people, being subjected to media treatments then of the mistaken bombing, goes up, and with each mistaken bomb, U.S. credibility in the world, in the region, in Iran, is diminished. There are other questions. What are the odds then an air war will improve the prospects for democracy in Iran? What are the odds that another war will make Iran less threatening to the U.S. and Israel?  What are the odds that another war led by the United States will increase America’s capacity to solve the other problems in the world—Iraq, Afghanistan, the war on terror, international trade? You name the issues, will our credibility be enhanced if we conduct another war in the Middle East? Now Reuel wrote his essay before the war in Lebanon. I would argue that war has even further raised the bar, the difficulty, of thinking that a war against Iran will actually solve this problem. We believe that another war would leave the United States and the world worse off than we would be by pursuing an alternative strategy. If you agree, you should vote in favor of the resolution. We argue there’s plenty of evidence to conclude that if more energetic efforts to prevent Iran from getting nuclear— —fail, it will still be possible to deter and contain Iran from using nuclear weapons against anyone. Iran’s president is alarming, he is indeed alarming. But the leadership in Iran is collective, and it includes many old men. These old men did not get old by being suicidal. Iran, Persia, has thousands of years of grand history, and there’s no reason whatsoever to think that Iranian nationalists would sacrifice their nation and their civilization in a nuclear war of their making. There is other evidence of Iran’s deterability. Iran has not attacked the weaker United Arab Emirates with which it has a dispute over two resource-rich islands. Iran did not attack the Sunni extremist Taliban government in Afghanistan, even when that government killed, murdered, nine Iranian diplomats. Iran has a Jewish population that is free to leave but chooses not to. There is no evidence that Iran is not deterable. Indeed, as Reuel has written, The Islamic republic ceased to produce holy warriors by the end of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988. The potential for chiliastic rapture has just dried up.” The bigger point is this. Voting for the motion does not mean doing nothing, or turning the other cheek to Iran. Voting for the motion means deciding that another war will not solve this problem, and that a robust, extremely tough strategy of deterrence and containment would be the most effective way to keep a nuclear Iran from threatening the United States and its friends. Thank you. "

    "data":"I thought George gave a very eloquent statement of why we should not go to war with Iran, and if that were the proposition that we were debating, I think his arguments were spot-on. That however is not the proposition we’re debating. The proposition we’re debating is that we should not tolerate a nuclear Iran. That’s quite a different matter. In fact, there are many things that we could do, even if Iran got a nuclear weapon, that would suggest to me that we would have non-military ways in order to persuade Iran to give up that weapon. Most of the countries of the world which developed—which had nuclear weapons have given them up, and not through war. So there are in fact many things that we can do, that would show we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran, short of war. So I would rather spend my time discussing the proposition as stated to you, namely that we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran, rather than discussing whether or not to go to war with Iran. I would like to suggest that when it comes to a nuclear Iran, the proposition is very well-stated, because it leaves vague exactly what do we mean. Are we talking about the nuclear family in Iran? Or what are we talking about here? I for one have no objections if Iranians care to choose to live in nuclear families. But what we are likely to have is a very gray case. We in fact do not have a smoking gun to show that Iran has a nuclear weapons program. It’s unlikely that we’re going to wake up some morning to find that Iran has exploded a nuclear weapon. What we have to deal with instead, is what Iran openly declares that it is doing—namely building this complicated thing called a nuclear fuel cycle, to make the materials for having a nuclear weapon. The Iranians themselves have described well why they’re doing this. In a remarkable speech, their chief negotiator for their nuclear weapons program wrote that having a fuel-cycle capability almost means the country that possesses this capability is able to produce nuclear weapons, should that country have the political will to do so. Now that’s the judgment of the Iranian government. The Nobel Peace Prize-winning head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed Al Baradei—who you may recall was no friend of George Bush on the Iraq matter—says that if Iran does what Iran announces it’s intending to do, that Iran will be, quote, a few months,” end quote, away from having a nuclear weapon. So our real question is, do we want to see Iran have that kind of a capability, on the edge of having a nuclear weapon but not quite there. We’re not going to have the dramatic moment where Iran explodes a nuclear weapon necessarily. If we need to act, we need to act much before then. We need to act when Iran is getting this capability to make the essential elements for a nuclear weapon. That is what we have to concentrate on stopping. Indeed, why do I think that that is something that not only we cannot tolerate, but we need not tolerate. Let me count some of the reasons. First is that what the Iranians are doing, is exploiting a loophole in the system that we have constructed to make sure that the world does not have a hundred countries with nuclear weapons. The Iranians have correctly identified a real weakness in our system of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. Indeed, Muhammad Al Baradei has proposed a five-year moratorium on the construction of all fuel-cycle facilities worldwide, and has said that any such facility should be under international control, because the technology is so dangerous. If Iran gets away with building this, it will not be the only country. We will not only have to tolerate a nuclear Iran, we will have to tolerate a nuclear Turkey, a nuclear Egypt, a nuclear Saudi Arabia. A nuclear Algeria. A nuclear Venezuela. A nuclear South Africa. A nuclear Brazil. When we start having 20 or 30 countries with nuclear weapons, and we start having a multiple system of deterrence, it’s going to be very interesting if we have to go through the Cuban Missile Crisis another 20 or 30 or 40 times. I’m not confident it’ll turn out so positively every time. I don’t think that deterrence is something that we can count on working every time, the way it did work with the Soviets, once the Soviets got so tired and Brezhnev took over, and couldn’t care less about revolution. But in any case, I say we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran, because if we tolerate a nuclear Iran, we will be tolerating many, many more nuclear countries, and that is not something that will lead to peace in the world. Furthermore, we need not tolerate a nuclear Iran, because there is much that we can do to stop it without having to talk about going to war. The fact is that Iran has acknowledged to the International Atomic Energy Agency that it’s been carrying out these clandestine nuclear activities for 18 years. But they haven’t gotten very far. Now, a lot of that has broadcast our success, in fact having a system which does limit what Iran can do. We have had a lot of successes in our efforts in stopping Iran’s program. You may recall that we were very worried when the Soviet Union fell apart that its scientists and nuclear matter would show up around the world, causing proliferation. We started a big program called the Nunn-Lugar Program to prevent that. And in fact, none of it has shown up in Iraq. None of it.  Indeed, the Iranians have had to, on the whole, do things themselves. The only thing that they were able to buy was a set of blueprints from A.Q. Khan of Pakistan. I don’t know about you, but I can’t assemble furniture from Ikea when I buy it with the blueprints. I certainly can’t program my VCR with the instructions that come with it. So buying a set of blueprints didn’t really get the Iranians necessarily that far ahead. Indeed, that’s why their program has taken 18 years, and is going very slowly. President Ahmadinejad of Iran claimed this last spring that they were going to have 3,000 centrifuges up and operational by the end of the year. I don’t think he’s going to have 300. And we can, by reinforcing our system of controls on Iran’s access to advanced technology, by mobilizing the world community, slow down Iran’s program dramatically. To the point where Iran might be able to make one bomb, but I don’t think it’ll be able to make a lot of bombs, and it certainly won’t have a way to deliver that thing. And if this bomb ends up being some two-ton monstrosity that they can barely fit into a bread truck, then they won’t have easy ways of delivering this thing. So, there are always ways in which the control on technologies makes the real difference. That’s why we should continue our efforts to limit Iran’s access to these advanced technologies, rather than tolerating a nuclear Iran and saying, well, now you’re in the nuclear club. Okay, join the club, you can do what you want. No. We should, even if Iran’s program progresses dramatically, continue to press them, continue to work on them— and not tolerate it. Furthermore, as George laid out at the end of his presentation, there are excellent reasons to think that, in fact, the Iranian government is pretty cautious, in spite of this Ahmadinejad of the moment. On the whole, right now the Iranians think that they’re on top of the world and the strategic situation’s very good for them. But that too will change, and our job is to press them, press them so that the cautious element—which I entirely agree with George is very much there in the leadership—comes to the fore, and the Iranians decide that this thing too risky, it’s not good for Iran’s security, and we can get them to stop this program, or if the program’s advanced a long way, we can get them to reverse it. Most of the countries that have had nuclear weapons have given them up. So we do not have to tolerate a nuclear Iran, we can get them to stop, or if necessary to reverse. "

    "data":"Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here tonight to tell you why we must tolerate a nuclear Iran. It’s time for the United States to rewrite the balance of power. Iran has been using its nuclear program to bolster its legitimacy, domestically in Iran, regionally in the Middle East, and internationally, And this tactic is coming at the expense of American credibility and influence in these arenas. So by engaging Iran over its nuclear program, Washington can take this tool of coercion out of Tehran’s hands, and once again have a larger degree of influence as well as credibility within Iran, within the region of the Middle East, and internationally. Let me tell you how Tehran is using its nuclear program to its advantage. Let me start with the domestic. By engaging, the U.S. would prevent the Iranian regime from using the nuclear program as a pretext for regime preservation. Through its domestic policies, Tehran has advanced its power under the guise of this program. The administration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is tactically manipulating its nationalistic nuclear ambitions to foster support domestically. Important though, is if you ask the average Iranian, what is nuclear energy, or what is uranium enrichment, they wouldn’t be able to tell you. This is what the government has homed in on. They’ve been able to exploit the double standards that exist within the international community, vis-à-vis Iran’s nuclear program, compared to India’s, Pakistan’s, North Korea’s, and even Israel’s. This is what the government draws strength. An edict was issued roughly six months ago through the National Security Council preventing negative media from being reported on nuclear issues domestically, and the government uses censorship of media to control popular access to any nuclear-related information, among other information as well. This way, the government has been successful in perpetuating nuclear nationalism, and controlling the effect of that nationalism. For Iran, the nuclear issue is linked to the nation’s place in the modern world, national pride, and resistance against the West. An effort to prevent Iran’s program from advancing is further associated to discrimination, and perpetuated by fears of sanctions and regime change. More interestingly, as I observed this summer during my visit to Tehran, Ahmadinejad has more support throughout Tehran today and in other cities on foreign policy issues than he did last year after he was surprisingly elected. This is due to his confrontational approach, compared to the policy of détente that was pursued under the Hatami administration. You might ask why. That’s because many Iranians feel quite happy and proud that he has taken on the nuclear portfolio and succeeded in garnering more concessions for Iran, compared to what was going on during the tenure of President Hatami. So these confrontational tactics are also domestic tactics pursued by the government, acts of deflection to perpetuate a constant state of fear domestically, with regards to sanctions and even a military strike, and these tactics are designed to strengthen the hand of the regime and the unclear program. This is why we should tolerate a nuclear Iran. We should think about the Iranians at home that have to suffer under the regime. The same time, the government is using the opportunity of the nuclear threat to launch a domestic crackdown on elites within the system. They’ve closed down reformist newspapers. They’re purging universities of secular academics. They’re detaining students. They’re purging bureaucrats from the system. All in an effort to silence opposition, and all under the paradigm and all under the guise of the nuclear program. The regime is ever more united in the face of opposition. Let’s also consider a counter-factual. If we do not tolerate Iran’s unclear program, we are playing into the hands of Ahmadinejad. He dreams of becoming a war president. Why was he elected? He was elected on an economic platform. He was elected to be a populistic President. But since he’s been in power for the past year, he has yet to meet the demands of the people, and he has been pursuing foreign policy issues, not economic ones. Any nuclear strike, military strike, or sanctions would give him just cause for continuing to neglect his electoral mandate. So let me offer you even one more final reason why we should tolerate a nuclear Iran on the domestic agenda. The government is further playing to these domestic nationalistic sentiments of the Iranian street, and playing up against the Iranian street that has historically been very pro-American. They’re using their imagery of the war, and they’re using fear of sanctions and regime change to change the sentiment in Iran against the United States, and this is a huge loss for Washington. Let’s turn to the region. Ahmadinejad has also exploited the nuclear issue to no end. This issue has gained a lot of support among the Arab and Muslim street. He’s spoken of the double standards that exist among U.S. policies in the Middle East. He’s taken on the plight of the Palestinians, challenging the order in the recent war this summer, and he’s earned praise in capitols from Cairo to Jakarta. There’s also a credible threat of proxy war. It’s a notable one, and the regime has cultivated relations with proxies to counterbalance the very large American presence in the region with two unfinished wars on Iran’s borders. So Tehran’s message is simple—it’s a regime not to be reckoned with [sic]. The U.S. is in a weakened position in Iraq, Palestine, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and with this growing conflict within the religion of Islam. Tehran is exploiting this to its advantage, drawing on the Arab street for support at the expense of the United States. Internationally. The regime’s confrontational regional and domestic approach of the nuclear program has also divided and weakened the international community at Washington’s expense. Unable to unite the international community and drive a consensus on sanctions, only weakens Washington’s position further. Jacques Shirac recently defected, and China and Russia are unable to back Washington— on any sanctions in this nuclear jockeying that’s going back and forth. Let’s compare Ahmadinejad. He’s able to rally 118 NAM nations to support Iran’s ambitions, and the United States can’t rally the P-5 and the Security Council? That’s depressing. So, Ahmadinejad says he supports dialogue, let’s take him up on this offer. I leave you with this. The U.S. is losing the Iranian street, it’s moving into dangerous territory in the Arab and Muslim world, and it’s losing support in the Security Council. Let’s take the lever away from Tehran. Let’s not allow them to exploit their nuclear program at our expense anymore. Thank you. "

    "data":"Bigotry against tall men. I just want to start off by thanking George for using my own words against me. I sort of had the sensation of arguing with my wife and I inevitably lose those encounters. I will suggest that perhaps he maybe used some of my words a little selectively. I mean, I think Patrick handled the geo-strategic issues rather well, I’m not going to go back over those. I also am not going to go over a point-counterpoint on the individual repercussions of a bombing run. I did that, as George said, at great length in a Weekly Standard piece and there’s no reason for me to torture any of you here who read it the first time through. But I will focus on a couple of issues which I think tend to get overlooked, particularly in American and Europe audiences. When I hear the other side talking, I hear them talking about Iran as if it’s a status quo country. I almost never hear them talk about God. I almost never hear them talk about the religious inspiration that still fuels the regime at the very top. What people have been anticipating inside of the Islamic republic for the longest period of time, is that it would go thermidor. They thought it with Rafsanjani, who by the way should really be considered the father of the Iranian nuclear weapon. They thought it with him, even though at the very same time he was unleashing the Intelligence Ministry, the Revolutionary Guard Corps and assassination teams and bombing teams that went around the world in the 1980s and ‘90s. They thought it about Rafsanjani when he was calling these ecumenical movements, bringing in Sunni militants into Tehran on a regular basis and having outreach programs. By the way, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Al Qaeda’s number two, has been probably Tehran’s favorite poster boy for over 20 years. I will just add there’s something deeply suspicious about members of Al Qaeda moving through Iran before 9-11 and moving through Iran after 9-11. It’s also very unusual for individuals who are under house arrest in Tehran to be placing cell phone calls to operational units of Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia. That is not the usual routine that people have when they’re under house arrest. I think we have to understand that absolutely, when you deal with the vast majority of Iranian people, certainly Iranian men—these are the ones we’re primarily talking about—that that chiliastic drive that you saw in the 1980s, they were really the mothership of much of the jihadism mentality that we see today transferred over to the Sunni world, it’s dead. It died. If nothing else it died with the end of Khomeini who was sort of the charismatic inspiration. Unfortunately for the hardcore and for the elite, it’s not dead. I would argue it is as alive today as it was before. That doesn’t mean, once again, that you will not find individuals in that league who cannot be, quote, quite pragmatic. I was quite struck by the commentary of the fellow on CBS, the very, very old fellow, who went to interview Ahmadinejad and he said he seemed like a very rational man. That is I think a very Western comment, because we have this sort of false juxtaposition that individuals of die-hard belief and faith cannot be rational. They absolutely are. I mean Khomeini was a very, very rational man, he had a certain love of Neoplatonism that people don’t talk about but he was a more or less rational man. The same is true of Ahmadinejad but Ahmadinejad is a die-hard believer. So by the way is Khomeini, so by the way I would argue is Rafsanjani. What we have to worry about, is in fact that the anti-Americanism at that level has not diminished. You have to think, do you want to do what is necessary to try to stop them from getting nuclear weaponry, because you’re not primarily talking about an exchange of nuclear weapons being a firing-off between the United States and Iran. The Iranians realize that will probably end up very badly for them. What are you interested in is, will this give them an umbrella for protection of terrorism. I think if you look at the Western track record dealing with the clerical regime, that you have to say we’ve done a very poor job of responding to them. In many ways we have been at war with the Islamic republic since its inception, except we have not responded. They have bombed, they have attacked, they have killed American soldiers, we did not respond. I suggest to you that what you’re going to see life they get nuclear weapons is a new inspiration, I think it’s already out there, and I would expect that Ahmadinejad is once again trying to do what Khomeini and Rafsanjani had tried in the 1980s and failed. That was to lead the radical Islamic world on a new anti-American jihad. I think you’re going to see them try to do it again, and the acquisition of nuclear weapon is a key to that element. It is their safeguard, it is their protection. Once they have that I would argue that in fact the odds of them being able to strike the United States through proxies or directly will go up astronomically. Should you take that risk? I would say no, that you have to say, do you want to give individuals who run what I would call sort of a more sophisticated version of bin Ladinism, do you want to let them have the nuke? I would say under no circumstances. Is it worthwhile to take the repercussion from that in Afghanistan, which I don’t think are that much, in Iraq, and I might add, the way Iraq is going it’s going to be so bad —it’s going to be very difficult for the Iranians to try to make a difference. If you are willing to absorb the repercussion of that, I would say yes, absolutely, the nightmare scenarios that you would have when you have this hardcore elite, which I would argue will become more and more radical. Because in fact the vast majority of Iranians have sheared away from the visions and the dreams and the promises of the Islamic revolution. They are not going in the direction of their citizenry, would that they were. They’re going in the opposite direction. The people inside of that regime, particularly I would argue the most important people, the clergy, the dissident clergy that I would argue are still the hope for that regime in the future, have in fact lost ground if not been completely stuffed. I would agree with Sanam that public diplomacy is a very good idea. The United States should try to wage as best a public diplomacy as possible. But public diplomacy is not going to— the nuclear weapons issue. Would that we actually could improve our position inside Iran, and I would just add by the way, the United States has a far better position inside that country, and it has maintained a relatively, if not pretty seriously hostile position against the Islamic republic now for over 25 years, while the Europeans have constantly tried to use engagement, yet their position inside of Iran I think is far, far less. Hostility towards the clerical regime has not cost us inside that country, it has in fact gained us a following. So you have to decide, are you willing to take a really serious risk, and I would add just tactically, you have to say yes. Because diplomacy you know isn’t going to work unless you threaten the possibility, you have to be serious about it, of using military strikes. The only reason the Europeans—and they will tell you that if you talk to the Germans and the French and the British "

    "data":"Okay. Thank you so much for coming, it’s really a privilege to be here and it’s a privilege to be personally speaking for Bill Kristol. It’s a big privilege and a big challenge. When I was in high school my father used to watch the Sunday morning talk shows. My favorite guest was always Bill Kristol because he was always so thoughtful and sensible and sensitive, I just assumed he was a liberal. I must admit I was a late bloomer intellectually. I would just like to first start off by reiterating the point that George made, that I think all six of us here are after the same thing at the end of the day—an Iran which is democratic, which is free, which is prosperous, and which is not armed with a nuclear weapon. That would be the ideal option. So the question is not whether or not the Islamic republic is a cruel regime. It is, I can tell you as someone who has been detained in Tehran by the Revolutionary Guard, it is a cruel regime. The question is not, again, why or whether or not Iran should have a nuclear weapon we should tolerate. I think personally it would be disastrous if they were to acquire a nuclear weapon. But the question on our panel is, should we tolerate it, and that begs the question, should we go to war with Iran to prevent it. Which cost would be higher, to actually accept Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon, or going to war with them to prevent it. I would suggest that the latter option would be far more dangerous, bombing Iran to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear. I’m a bit surprised tonight that the other side of the table is seeming to—I’m a bit too junior to contradict them too much—but they’re running away from the argument somewhat because both Reuel and Bill are on the record saying that they would bomb Iran. So hopefully, we hear that from Bill in the next round.  I would just argue similar to what Sanam said, that if Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was here tonight, he would be arguing on the other side of the table, meaning I think he very much wants to see a confrontation between the U.S. and Iran.  I will just suggest why in three different contexts, why the Iranians, particularly the hard-liners in Tehran, would like to see a confrontation between the U.S. and Iran. The first context is the regional context. What was very interesting for me following the right-wing Iranian media was these comments which Secretary Rice made after the war in Lebanon in July. What she called it was the birth pangs of a new Middle East.” When I was following the Iranian right-wing media, it was very interesting how much they agreed with Secretary Rice, they said indeed it is the birth pangs of a new Middle East. Indeed this is a proxy war between the U.S. and Iran for hegemony in the Middle East, for Arab and Muslim hearts and minds. In fact we’re very well-placed to fight this war, and what’s very disconcerting right now is that these same newspapers in Tehran which are very fascist when it comes to domestic politics, are Jeffersonian democrats when it comes to regional politics because they say, actually, democratic elections are very much in our interest. Hamas came to power in Palestine, Hezbollah came to power in Lebanon through democratic elections, the Muslim Brotherhood had a very strong showing in Egypt. Hardcore religious came to power in Iraq via democratic elections. So in fact, we are winning this war for Arab and Muslim hearts and minds, and given the U.S.’s low standing in the region, it looks like history is now on our side. Opinion polls which are conducted show that among the Arab street, the three most popular leaders are Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, and Khaled Meshaal of Hamas. So right now Iran feels in a very good position, and I think that bombing the country they would feel even better-placed to fight this war for Arab and Muslim hearts and minds.  We should take into account that if we bomb Iran, oil prices are likely going to go up to $150 a barrel. Currently the regime is making about $200 million a day on oil revenue, so we double that, they’re going to make $400 million a day on oil revenue. I would argue that that will put them in a far better position to support Hamas and Hezbollah financially than if we don’t bomb the country. I think that just, if we’re serious about fighting this war, which is becoming very much this self-fulfilling prophecy of the clash of civilizations, we’re going to have to figure out a way to resolve our differences in the Middle East without using bombs. The second point is from a non-proliferation perspective, from a nuclear perspective. What would happen if we actually bomb Iran to try to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Let’s play out the scenario, in fact I played out the scenario with a Navy captain.  Say we bomb these sites. First of all we don’t know where many of them are, some of them are underground, some of them we don’t have intelligence on, so we can’t be sure that we bombed the right sites. Second of all some of them are near population centers, we would be killing Iranian civilians. Quite frankly, you know, if you talk to nuclear physicists they say, well, Iran actually has quite a bit of know-how right now. It’s like baking a cake. They have the ingredients, they have the recipe, and they have the cooks, they have the scientists. Unless you’re going to kill the scientists, you’re going to kill the cooks, I mean, it’s going to be very difficult to set back this program a long way. At most, in talking to nuclear physicists, it will take Iran two to three years to recalibrate. At that point, if we bomb them, international public opinion may well side with them, and the Iranians may say in fact we now are after a nuclear weapon because we now have been shown that we need it to protect our sovereignty. At that point, when you bomb these sites and you don’t know where Iran is recalibrating these facilities, maybe underground, if we really then want to avert the prospect we’ll have to send in group troops. At this point, with our troops spread thin in Iraq and Afghanistan, that doesn’t look like a welcome prospect. Now from the domestic perspective, this is the one that for me I feel most strongly about. When I first started this job, I didn’t get involved in this work because I was passionate about centrifuges and cascades and things like that, this is what George was saying— but about the prospect of the future for the Iranian people. There’s this widespread notion that all Iranians are in favor of a nuclear program, which I would like to debunk. I think that, on one hand Iran is a nationalist country, and many people feel strongly that we’re a great nation, why this double standard. India and Pakistan can have this project, why can’t we. But at the same time this is a country that we forget experienced an eight-year war with Iraq. Not really one family was left unscathed by this war, there were half a million casualties. No one romanticizes the conflict or the prospect of further militarization. Quite frankly this is a very technical project, the idea of enriching uranium as opposed to importing enriched uranium from abroad, so the idea that your average Iranian in Shiraz or Tehran wakes up in the morning and says, you know, if only we could enrich uranium today our lives would be so much better half, has also been very much exaggerated. But I would argue that you present to the Iranian people two options. You present this publicly to the regime. A, pursue this nuclear program unequivocally, come what may, for the sanctions, isolation, potential militarization. Or B, you take certain nuclear compromises and you reenter the international community. You’re going to have the people put a lot of pressure on the regime to change their behavior, and so far this has not been a policy option which has been issued by the U.S. Thank you very much. "

    "data":"Thank you, Robert. Let me begin by thanking Bob Rosenkranz for bringing Intelligence Squared to New York and to the United States. I don’t know if Intelligence Squared has a slogan or motto in London, but over here you might want to think about, Fair and balanced.” We debate, you decide.” You might almost call this a no-spin zone here, you know. With Robert Siegel, it’s Bill O’Reilly… I shouldn’t have said that, this will ruin his career on NPR, and I’ll never be invited back to All Things Considered.” I personally came in undecided, um, as many of you did, and even leaning slightly to the other side, but I’ve been convinced by Reuel and Patrick’s brilliant arguments. Bob said he wanted intellectually respectable positions on both sides, and I have a high opinion of George and Sanam and Karim. But I’ve got to say that, unfortunately, they’re intelligent people but the arguments, while respectable, are not convincing. I was put off by Karim’s false praise of me for a second, and I salute Sanam for her genuine concern obviously for the Iranian people who I think we all agree deserve a much better regime than they have, and I think we all agree, we haven’t talked about this, deserve much more aggressive efforts on the part of the United States and other democracies and Europe could do much more here, to help them liberate themselves from this regime. George is one of the more reasonable Democrats in Washington. I’ve known him for a while and he worked for Senator Biden and I know that to be a fact, but the tip-off for all of you was when he said that he didn’t believe we should kill ourselves. That was a courageous break from the mainstream of the Democratic Party…I want to pay tribute to George, I’m doing my best to ruin all these people’s careers— I’m doing my best to ruin all of their careers. Look, we should not tolerate a nuclear Iran. Three quick reasons, and a couple of them have been touched on but maybe not developed. George says, and I think everyone probably agrees that we have to be tougher in our diplomacy, think more seriously about sanctions, and move perhaps outside the Security Council to get sanctions if we can, explore financial pressure to really squeeze Iran which I think the administration is beginning to do. Secretary of the Treasury Paulsen is working pretty seriously on this, and that would be done I think outside the Security Council through a sort of coalition of the willing on the Finance Ministry side. This is all good. None of this will work unless it’s backed up by the threat of force. Diplomacy will only work if there is a real threat of force, not just saying options are on the table, but a sense that we really won’t tolerate the outcome if Iran does not yield, if the moderates to the degree there are some in the Iranian regime, aren’t empowered by the pressure we’re putting on to prevent the headlong rush to nuclear weapons, and manage to change course domestically. Diplomacy can’t work without the threat of force, therefore, it would really be disastrous to diplomacy to say, we must tolerate a nuclear Iran. So whatever people might think one would have to do, and sometimes one has to do things in the real world seven or 10 years from now or three years from now I suppose, we should not say we should tolerate a nuclear Iran and therefore you should all vote No,” just to help diplomacy along. But I’m serious about that, and I’m serious that I believe shouldn’t at the end of—I will satisfy Karim and say that I would bomb Iran in a pinch. But it is important to not even signal weakness. The only reason the Europeans got serious in 2003 is that we went into Iraq, that we hadn’t yet encountered the difficulties we’ve encountered in the subsequent three years, and Iranians were worried and the Europeans were worried that Bush really would use force. That’s what made the Europeans much tougher than it looked as if they would have been prior to 2003. So for diplomacy to work, you need the credible threat of force, you therefore could not say that we would tolerate, or certainly not that we must tolerate a nuclear Iran. So for diplomacy to work you need the threat of force. The credible, real threat of force. Real plans, real attempt to lay the groundwork for it if it comes to that. Secondly, deterrence. That is the ultimate argument obviously on the other side, we can deter Iran, we deterred the Soviet Union, we deterred China. Pakistan and India have nuclear weapons and so far at least haven’t used them. That depends on the nature of the regime. Is this the Brezhnev regime, so to speak? Conservative, cautious old men, as George said? Or is this a much more radical regime, or at least a regime with radical elements in it, and do we have confidence that the radical elements won’t prevail internally? I don’t think so. This is a rising, confident, ambitious, aggressive regime, that thinks it’s carrying forth a historic mission, sort of a jihadist mission on behalf of Islam in general, particularly Shia Islam but perfectly willing to work with Sunni jihadists and also to compete with Sunni jihadists in radicalism which is itself very dangerous and of course that’s the story in some respects of the last 25 years in the Middle East, with the Wahabes and the Iranians competing to radicalize Islam and unfortunately, succeeding. Letting Iran progress towards nuclear weapons just increases the strength of all the worst radicalizing forces, the jihadist forces, within Islam. It would be disastrous in my opinion not just for Iran to get nuclear weapons. It’s disastrous for them to succeed in progressing towards nuclear weapons over the next two, four, six, eight years. Every month that we huff and puff and the Europeans huff and puff and we put off another Security Council resolution and they progress and Ahmadinejad comes here and is treated well by the Council of Foreign Relations and— and pays no price for anything he says or anything he does, every month and every year that that happens, the worst forces in the Middle East are strengthened, every government that’s teetering and isn’t sure which side to join basically, our side, the moderate side or the radical side, decides they have to cut a deal with the radical side. Individuals decide that looks like the way of the future, this is the classic, dangerous scenario. One hopes that the more moderate people, the more moderate forces in the Iranian regime, are going to prevail, and the only way to help them to prevail, is not to reward Ahmadinejad. That is what we are now doing by holding open the possibility that we would tolerate a nuclear Iran. It’s not just that it would be terrible if they got nuclear weapons. There, I think incidentally, it’s not just tolerating a nuclear Iran, it’s tolerating a nuclear Egypt and a nuclear Saudi Arabia, and then a whole bunch of nuclear countries which itself creates a very dangerous world. It is also the process of getting towards a nuclear Iran, is itself extremely dangerous  I don’t like to use models from the ‘30s or the analogy of the ‘30s or Hitler but in this respect it is like the ‘30s. Hitler’s success at each stage strengthened him internally, he didn’t start out in firm control of the regime of which he was chancellor. There were others who thought he was reckless. Every time he did something reckless and got away with it, it discredited his internal credits, it empowered fascists elsewhere in Europe and other regimes began moving in that direction. The democracies became demoralized, we ended up fighting a war against a much more powerful fascist alliance-axis than would have been the case if we had acted much earlier. We face that prospect unfortunately if we let a jihadist radical regime successfully pursue nuclear weapons in the Middle East today. "

    "data":"Thank you very much for being here this evening. I'd like to thank first of all IQ2 and the Rosenkranz Foundation. And looking out at the audience today it's truly extraordinary what a diverse group we have. Uh people in the audience who wouldn't normally sit together to discuss such difficult and emotion – and often emotional issues. Um I'd also like to thank Judy Woodruff for uh being here to uh to moderate this debate. And I'd also like to thank my fellow debaters. Uh I am very much looking forward to this evening's intellectual combat. The subject of this evening's debate is in one sense rather puzzling. Despite electoral success, Hamas is still a terrorist organization. What is there really to debate here? What does participation in an election have to do with Hamas' profile as a terrorist organization? I am quite sure that my colleagues on the other side of the debate will tell you that the Palestinian elections were the truest, freest and fairest in the Arab world. That's an absolutely true statement. They're also going to tell you that the outcome reflected the will of the Palestinian people. That's an absolutely false statement. And three, they're gonna tell you that Hamas provides critical social services to Palestinians in need. That is, my friends, totally irrelevant to tonight's subject. These arguments amount to little more than an analytical slight of hand. An organization can participate in a free and fair election. It can provide social services and be a terrorist organization. There is no seriously scholarly work out there that indicates that any of these activities are mutually exclusive. Despite what Bob Rosenkranz said in his eloquent remarks to open this evening's events, it is not an intellectual position to suggest that Hamas is no longer a terrorist organization. It's an ideological position. It's ideological. Rather than an analytical conclusion based on the available evidence, let's consider a few things. I'll leave it to my colleagues to describe for you the number of innocents who have been killed at the hands of Hamas. But it's important to provide some historical context here. To the evolution of Hamas. Hamas' very founding in the late 1980's was based on an imperative of violence. In the late 1980's, members of the Palestine branch of the Muslim Brotherhood grew concerned that another organization called Islamic Jihad was taking prestige and influence away from them because Islamic Jihad was engaged in violence. Their solution to this political problem was the establishment of Hamas. They would continue the Islamization of Palestinian society from below through the provision of social services, in keeping with the historic mission of the Muslim Brotherhood. But they also established a military wing. A military wing that was dedicated to terrorist acts against Israelis in an effort to burnish their nationalist image and out-maneuver Islamic Jihad. The founding covenant of Hamas which has not changed is explicit in its mission to elaborate all of historical Palestine through a variety of tactics including violence. The result has been the bloody carnage of the streets of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Ashkelon and numerous other Israeli cities. My critics will say this is old news. Hamas has evolved. It's become a political organization. This as Mahmoud Mohamedou said is a historic opportunity. But my question is has Hamas really evolved? It still denies Israel's right to exist. None of its leaders have renounced the right to armed struggle. The only thing has changed is a tactical change. It has sought to harness the elections that the United States has pushed on the Palestinians to advance its agenda. And what is that agenda? The establishment of a Palestinian state in all of historic Palestine with sharia Islamic law at its core. Well what about a cease fire? My critics will tell you there's been a cease fire since 2003. Be careful about the words that people use when talking about a cease fire. Hamas calls it a hudna. My colleague Mahmoud Mohamedou calls it tahdiya. Well in fact both of those, both of those have a temporary quality to them. Anyone who speaks Arabic should know that a hudna has a finite period of time. It's not much of a cease fire anyway. Since the Israelis withdrew from the Gaza Strip they've been victim of rocket assaults on their towns, the kidnapping of their soldiers and threats to their major cities. Under the weight of available evidence and I have a little bit of uh a little bit of this just before. Stanley and I were standing around before, talking about what we did agree on. The Giants, the Yankees, the Knicks and the desultory state of our teams. And then we got into talking about Hamas and I said sure, they wouldn't be a terrorist organization, they just have to lay down their arms. And he said you're right the Israelis have to lay down their arms. That's not the point. It's cute, it's funny but it's not the point. Under the weight of available evidence, supporters of Hamas tend to shift their argument to focus on Israeli behavior. And I should point out a case in point was Judy Woodruff's extraordinary interview with former President Carter last night on the NewsHour.” It is true, Israel has expropriated land and continues to illegally settle the West Bank. Israel has killed Palestinian civilians. Though unlike Hamas not intentionally. It has worked assiduously to undermine Mahmoud Abbas and before him Yasser Arafat. All this is very, very true. But it neither alters the fact that Hamas is a terrorist organization. Nor absolves Hamas of the bloody responsibility for its own behavior. If the issue was Israel's contributed to an environment where extremist ideologies, alienation and terrorism can thrive, there would be little to debate. But this is not the subject we're examining here this evening. Participation in elections – Hamas' participation in the Palestinian elections is analytically irrelevant of whether it is a terrorist organization or not. It is a group that remains dedicated to Israel's destruction and in the process of that destruction, the inevitable killing of innocents. For Hamas to no longer be considered a terrorist organization it must change its charter. It must renounce its violence and it must lay down its arms. At that point and only at that point can it be seen as a legitimate participant in the political arena. With that I urge you, I urge you to vote with the proposition that a democratically elected Hamas is and remains a terrorist organization. Thank you very much."

    "data":"I would like to thank everyone for the invitation for tonight. To repeat this is a wonderful event. It's much needed in this city. I find myself sort of changing what I wanted to say as I was sitting here and listening to my adversary. I come from a different perspective. Interestingly enough, I’ve just returned from Damascus where I happened to be meeting with the leadership of Hamas. And I and I bring that to your attention because when I said I was coming to a debate in New York City over whether you're a terrorist organization or not, the leadership said you Westerners you spend all your time debating how many angels are on the head of a pin and history marches on. And that's not to denigrate or the significance of this debate, this discussion tonight. But to keep in its perspective that while we debate, while we argue, while we disagree, there is death and destruction on the ground. And while my adversary trivializes the injury to Palestinians, I'd like to sort of begin by really honing in on what we're talking about tonight. Since the year 2000, 4,800 Palestinians, mostly civilians killed. 839 children under ten. 755 women. 31,750 injured. 800 permanently disabled. 241 extrajudicial assassinations. 11,000 Palestinians including 380 under the age of sixteen and 240 women sitting in jails, most of whom who have never had a trial, have never seen a judge and do not have counsel. 4,800 homes demolished. 4,200 businesses destroyed. Thousands of hectares of oil groves razed. In the last five months, while unfortunately Israel has lost ten civilians, 557 Palestinians of whom 420 were civilians including 116 women and thirty three children were killed by the Israeli defense forces. Now collective punishment it's not the exception. Attacks on the infrastructure, the disruption of water plants, the destruction of electricity. Unemployment. Infant mortality rates. Disease. Malnutrition. These are not issues for abstract debate. These are harsh realities for Palestinians. Who did this? Hamas didn't do this, Israel did this. And it's not new. Think back to the British. The Stern gang, Menachem Begin, a Prime Minister of Israel, a terrorist. The King David and [INAUDIBLE] hotels blown up. The UN mediator assassinated by the Stern gang. Ethnic cleansings with 800,000 Palestinians driven from their homers. 400 villages erased from the map. So this is not some sort of esoteric debate with the West. This is reality. This is truth and this is sixty years. An unbroken trail of terrorism, not at the hands of Hamas. But at the hands of Israel. Dar Yassin, Sabra and Shatila, I love the notion about how Israel always unlike Hamas, accidentally kills. Bethanune last week, nineteen women and children sitting in a house, an errant tank shell. Of course the apologies, of course Israel says oops well sorry. We'll have an investigation and on it goes. And what of international law? The Geneva conventions that prohibit systematic torture. The Israeli Supreme Court eventually put an end to it. The occupied lands in violation of Israeli law and Geneva conventions. It goes on and on. 321 condemnations by the United – United Nations Generally General Assembly ignored. Ninety one condemnations by the Security Council ignored. There is a double standard. And that's what's interesting and I mean no disrespect to the debate tonight. As a trial attorney sometimes I say to a witness so when did you stop beating your wife? And the witness looks at you like what are you talking about? And that's the problem with the debate. It starts out with a pre-conceived notion that Hamas is a terrorist organization. To much of the world, Hamas is not viewed as a terrorist organization but rather a national liberation movement involved in low intensity, asymmetric warfare. To much of the world or many in the world community, Israel is viewed as a terrorist state. The problem is civilians are always caught in between. I don't apologize for any civilian getting killed anywhere but I don't make light of it as if they're just fodder for the Israeli machine. We know in this country we're used to civilian causalities. Sherman's march on Atlanta. The fire bombings in Dresden. It goes on. If you're a North American Indian you're a little bit familiar with terrorism in this particular context. And Israel in the war this summer, a million cluster bombs and antipersonnel mines. There is a fine line between terrorism and freedom fighter unfortunately. And it is who wins. Every person in the world dies to have a picture taken with Nelson Mandela. Who stayed in jail an extra eight years because he refused to renounce armed struggle. Malcolm X, an American by any means necessary. Now he's on postage stamps. So we have to be careful about evolving notions of terrorism. We have to be careful about language and what we suggest to the community. Who is Hamas? Hamas is not just a military wing. It's just kids strapping explosives on themselves. They're doctors and lawyers and professors and scientists and academics who have given their life to try to get, to try to reclaim what has been stolen from them. Now you can trivialize the election but most important remember Hamas is millions of people who voted and many of them with a bigger plurality than George Bush ever appreciated in his two terms, voted for Hamas. Now there's a double standard. The West, including Israel loves Abu Masen. And why do they love him? Well because he speaks Western. He talks Western. He walks the walk. He looks good. He's a good Palestinian leader. What's interesting is he's not considered a terrorist even though he's a figure head of Fatah which has an armed movement called al-Aqsa. They do bombings but he's OK. Hamas is not. Now what do we know that's happened since the election? Collective punishment. Leaders kidnapped. Cabinet members kidnapped. An attempt to destabilize and topple a legitimate elected government. Economic embargoes and strangulation. Providing arms to the other side. The bottom line here is Hamas is the only group that can deliver. Let us find a way to break out of this cycle. To break out of this abyss. To forget about labels. Labels mean nothing. The only group that can deliver is Hamas, and you know what – if they can't, they'll be voted out. And at the end of the day it's time to end the embargo, it's time to empty the jails, it's time to stop the attempt to topple a government. But most of all forget the labels and forget the rhetoric. For sixty years it has not worked. Give the alternative a chance. Thank you."

    "data":"Madam Chairperson, ladies and gentlemen. Uh well thank you for that kind introduction before Ms. Woodruff. And um and I want to share in the general uh agreement of the panel here that we're grateful for the organizers of this event of which there ought to be many more. Uh in order to stimulate genuinely interesting debate. I um I will begin by going straight to the topic. Because anyone who deals with terrorism has to be begin, and I was asked to do this by the last speaker, with its definition. I think you must also scotch the old canard that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. My own definition has the distinction of having been adopted by the Court of Appeals in Canada. If I may quote, Mister Justice Neland, quoting me in the case of Canada versus Najoub in October, 2001, the court spoke as follows – a terrorist is a man who murders indiscriminately, distinguishing neither between civilian and innocent and guilty nor soldier and civilian. He may employ terrorism – planting bombs in restaurants, hijacking planes, in a bad cause or a good one. He may be a Nazi terrorist or an anti-Nazi terrorist. A Communist or an anti-Communist. Pro Palestinian or pro-Israel. We may want to defeat his political cause or to see it triumph. For his methods however a terrorist is always to be condemned. Indeed to describe him objectively is to condemn him. Even if his cause is genuinely a fight for freedom with which we sympathize. Unquote, unquote. Now we are asked today to consider whether organizations that use terrorist methods as describe above should also be admitted into the arena of conventional politics and in particular to the arena of conventional democratic politics. The motion cites Hamas. But Hamas is not the only organization that combines seeking power through elections with terrorism. Hezbollah does the same. So does the Eta linked Batasuna party in the Basque region of Spain. So does the two headed Sinn Fein IRA in Northern Ireland. Nor are these organizations shy about their deeds. They openly boast of employing terrorism even if they sometimes quibble at the word. Sinn Fein for example has said clearly that it sought power through the Armalite rifle and the ballot box. These four parties I’ve mentioned have enjoyed varying degrees of success. They all raise the same question. If a democratically elected group employs terrorist methods, should it be regarded as having run itself out democratic politics and should we refuse, refuse to deal with it. Ideally I maintain that they should be run out of politics and that we should refuse to deal with them. Indeed I would go further. When we deal with such bodies, as if they are conventional parties, we are making murder respectable. We are in fact inciting people to murder. First because we are saying that murder is no bar to participation in high politics. And when we treat with terrorist parties supported by small numbers of voters as is true of the Basque party and it used to be true of Sinn Fein, we are inciting murder a second time. Because we have admitted, we are negotiating with them because they murder people and not for any other reason. When you incite murder you get more murders. Inciting terrorism has similarly produced a spreading stain of terrorism since the hijackings of Dawson Field in 1970. Let me make a first qualification for this bold statement of principle. If the price of halting a murderous insurgency is to admit the former terrorists into democratic politics that may sometimes be a price worth paying to save lives and establish a decent political order. But it is a price. The terrorists moreover must be former. They must have abandoned terrorism finally, completely and publicly. They cannot be mysteriously linked to terrorists still or leaving terrorism in a gradual way. They must be exclusively committed to democratic politics and willing to accept its verdicts even when those verdicts are unfavorable to them. I don't like making that concession. It means that crimes go unpunished, injustice is entrenched and the moral of democracy is tainted. Note though that is a very limited concession. While we may have to deal with former terrorists in official transactions of normal business, we should show them no signs of approval or respect. Even if they hold high government positions, they must be given no state visits, no honorary knighthood, no White House dinners. Until they have purged their guilt in some way, they must always feel the mark of Cane is on their brow. But the distinguished advocates tonight, opposite, are proposing something far more dramatic than easing former thugs out of terrorism and into official limousines. They suggest that we should treat as good faith democrats those who are still engaged in organizing suicide bombings and still planning rocket attacks. Their election it seems somehow validates their terror methods or at least their terror methods do not invalidate their election. Now here's my second qualification. We are going to reach somewhat different conclusions, depending on whether we are citizens of a country in which there is a terrorist group engaged in democratic politics. For example, if we're a Lebanese democrat in a state which has Hezbollah as a political party. Or depending on whether we are citizens of a state that is the um that is the neighbor of a country which has a terrorist government. For example the citizen of Israel next door to a government that includes um Hamas. Uh take the first case. The citizen of the state in which there is a terrorist party. Uh engaged in normal politics. That means that one party in politics has got its own private army and the others do not. It can intimidate the other parties. It can overturn election results, it can ignore political defeats. Uh it is not in a sense a normal political party at all. And its very existence is a contradiction of the concept of democracy that most of us would recognize. What happens in such cases? Well let us take the most favorable case for the other side, that of the Northern Ireland peace process which most people think has been a good thing. For the first eight years of this process OK. I'm afraid I'm gonna skip to the, to the other point. Different principles apply when we're talking about relations between states. If a state is at war with another, whether or not the enemy government is democratic is a very secondary consideration. What matters is the disposition of that state's foreign policy. Does the other state have a serious interest in making peace? If it makes peace will it keep its word? Does it have long term aims compatible with a stable peace? Are its internal dynamics such that the government offering to negotiate peace is likely to survive. On strictly practical grounds, it is hard to imagine a prudent citizen answering those questions positively if the other government is composed of terrorists or routed in a terrorist party. The terrorists have a serious interest in making peace – will they keep their word, are they trustworthy? Do they generally have political aims compatible with a stable peace? We should probably answer all those questions no. And if the terrorist government is democratically elected"

    "data":"Thank you very much Ms. Woodruff. You can add my voice to that of my colleagues to thank you and the organizers as well as the audience for this. Um it's a wonderful opportunity to have indeed intelligent debate. Um let me also preface my remarks by saying that my comments tonight are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect the views of my uh program. Let me pick up the argument where my friend Stan left it and it is that the inability to transcend the dominant misrepresentation of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, is increasingly becoming problematic for both intelligent debate and informed policy making. It is a narrative that most people know to be problematic if not faulty. Yet is persists. Tonight's motion fits that pattern. And I invite you to reject it on grounds of inaccuracy and lack of intelligence for that matter. Hamas is not a terrorist organization. Hamas was the radicalized military expression of a national liberation movement, which grew into a social movement. Hamas is no longer a terrorist organization. Hamas has moved to a political contest which it has joined legitimately and has won fairly. More importantly, Hamas holds high levels of legitimacy among the majority of the people that it has been elected to represent and lead. Now before developing these arguments um it is important to establish a set of facts, yet there is a familiar discourse, an emotional discourse about the plight of the Palestinians which I will not rehearse here tonight. It is a classical discourse which unfortunately has been, in recent years, rendered part of the background noise of world politics. Triggering almost a sort of Palestine fatigue. However, and in addition to the facts that Stanley has listed, it is the following facts that are crucial to the assessment of the situation and the proposed motion before us tonight. Thirty-nine years of occupation, 1.4 million people in Gaza alone, in three hundred and sixty square kilometers. Five hundred and forty checkpoints in the West Bank alone, with a forty percent increase in that number in the past year. Settlements and buildings and land confiscation, the building of a separation wall, not a fence, a wall deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice. Daily, near daily military incursions and sporadic killing, essentially almost half a century of Palestinian disposition, loss of life and freedom. Now in that most urgent of context, a group that emerges as a resistance movement, grows into a social network upgrading welfare centers and educational services, and agrees to abide by the rules of Democratic contest, can certainly no longer be called terrorist. Now Canadian definitions not withstanding, it is important, this is no mere matter of semantics to remember that the word “terrorist” is actually quite problematic when it comes to occupied people. Yes, indeed the saying “Your terrorist is my freedom fighter” captures that inherent subjectivity quite well. And some names were mentioned. To those we can add just this past century, Michael Collins and the IRA, and I will not even mention the Haganah, the Irgun, Yitzhak Shamir and others. Nelson Mandela and the ANC and so on, all of these people have been called by their opponents terrorists. The French resistance fighting the Germans, the FLN fighting the French. Yet time and again, both these individuals and their movements led their groups to national leadership and oftentimes through elections. But the operative word of the motion is “still,” so is Hamas still a terrorist organization? Well let us look at what Hamas has done in the past ten months since their election. Even before that election, Hamas had decided on and implemented the unilateral cease fire. Which it observed for fifteen months straight until the Israeli killing this past June of the seven members of Ghalia family. Hamas had made former statements at the highest level of its multi-faceted representation regarding a disposition to enter this long-term truce. Much is made of this concept of hudna. It is important to understand that in fact, the phraseology used and the legal term is actually quite important in relation to an Islamic movement, which per force, obligates them too, and indeed is a form of protorecognition to begin with. Hamas has been part of discussions throughout the summer and the fall on a draft document for a program that we quote, “respect previous agreements in a manner that protects and safeguards the high interest and the rights of the Palestinian people.” Hamas had also proposed a coalition government back in March which included Palestinian Christians and women and has folded its executive force into the former national police. What have Israel, the EU, and the United States done in the same time frame? Insisting on this Three-Fold demand that Hamas recognizes Israel, forswears violence, and accepts previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements. They have decreed and implemented a crippling international embargo with a new humanitarian crisis by UN reckoning, a security crisis by security specialists’ reckoning, and indeed some sort of Iraq-ization of Palestine with the birth in mid- October of Al Qaeda and Palestine, which sent its first, a novelty by Palestinian standards. But at this point one is really prompted to think, what kind of international community is this that is so blind to the injustice that it rationalizes? And the one that perpetuates out of illconceived and inefficient policies, but the argument that I'm putting before you is not an emotional one. It is not an ideological one, it is actually a rational one. The obvious problem with the Three-Fold demand is the disappearance of reciprocity. For the very same three demands could be put, but are not, to Israel. Israel has yet to recognize the existence of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders. Israel has yet to stop its use of violence against occupied people, including women and children, and Israel has yet to implement the very agreements that it’s made with Palestinian representers. It is therefore contradictory to depict Hamas as still a terrorist organization while punishing Palestinians for their democratic choice. It should also be said that we’re in effect, asking Hamas to be held to agreements which we no longer trust. While everyone is saying that Oslo is dead and that we need new thinking and moving on, we’re asking this newcomer to be held to these agreements which have faded or are certainly fading. And in effect, holding them to our own liabilities and failures. Contradictions are also displayed through a reading of the fact. There is no internationally agreed definition of terrorism, which is already an evidence of that problem. However, by law what qualifies a group as a group, an entity as terrorists is the indiscriminate targeting of civilians. So for the law to have any consistence, currency, it has to be applied across the board with certain selectivity. Which leads me to my last element. Hamas is an adolescent Hezbollah, and look at what Hezbollah has become next door. The strongest power in Lebanon and the first one to ever defeat Israel. So there’s a sort of the assumption that Hamas can be extricated from that political reality is unrealistic. Ladies and gentlemen, given half a chance, Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and his Hamas colleagues are Gerry Adamses in the making. Voting for this motion essentially means endorsing and supporting a unilateral, sterile understanding of this conflict. I invite you to exercise intelligence, display fairness, and vote against the motion. Thank you for your attention."

    "data":"Thank you very much. Can you hear me? Now start the clock now. Good evening, thank you very much for being here. With all due respect to my colleagues and my team, Steven Cook and John O’Sullivan who did a fantastic job, I must even thank more our adversaries, Stanley Cohen and Mahmoud, which did a great job actually convincing you I'm sure, to actually vote for the motion that Hamas is a terror organization. Actually I will depart. Naively I thought that uh, they will relate to the nature of Hamas. What do they do? What do they believe in? What is their conduct? But no, they actually opened the debate to a more geopolitical and historic um, issues which actually leave me on a much firmer ground. So I will depart from the notes I prepared here and I will answer the, my esteemed colleagues here on the other side who talked about occupation, who talked about Israeli aggression, who talked about UN resolutions, and I will say something which is very, very simple. Israel was attacked in 1967 by three countries around us, Jordan, Egypt, and Syria. The “Occupation,” quote-unquote as they call it, is this territory which was obtained by Israel as an act of self-defense. These three countries and others were trying to push us into the sea and actually destroy Israel, destroy the Jewish people who came back to their historic land, to their Biblical land, to the place where they belong. Now, the war happened in 1967. Israel was created in 19-, or was recreated in 1948. From 1948 to 1967, nineteen years, there was no occupation. West Bank belonged to Jordan, Gaza belonged to uh, Egypt, nobody talked about occupation then. Nobody talked about creating a Palestinian state. ] You know why? Because they wanted to create this Palestinian state right where Israel is now today, killing all the Jews. So from 1967 on, against her will, we had to defend ourselves and obtain possession of these territories. But still, we always wanted peace. The proof, 1977. When we had a leader like Anwar Sadat of Egypt, and he signed a peace treaty with us and he renounced terror and violence and he recognized Israel, Israel withdrew entirely from the Sinai, having peace with Jordan now for more than thirty years, uh, with Egypt for more than thirty years. 1995, Jordan, King Hussein, a great leader, wanted to make peace. We made peace. We withdrew from Israel and Jordan, recognizing each other, respecting each other, and not shooting at each other. In 1993, Israel, believing that the Palestinians really had a change of heart and they would like to make peace with us, we signed as the Oslo Accord. And the Oslo Accord was a very simple view, land for peace. Israel withdrawing from West Bank in Gaza, the Palestinians got a hold of themselves, stopped the terror, and becoming a responsible party. 2000, Camp David, former Prime Minister Barak meeting with uh, with Arafat to try and make peace. Barak is offering to withdraw from the entire territories, but this was not accepted by Arafat. Not only was it not accepted, but after it was rejected, this intifada started. Intifada is a misnomer, it was a very planned, pre-planned campaign of terror which cost more than a thousand Israeli lives, many children, devastation in our cities, and uh, continued rejection of the very notion of the right of Israel to exist in its home land. Now people compare between Camp David ’78 that succeeded with Saddam Hussein, with, with us with Sadat. I'm very tired, I came back from Israel not a few hours ago, between Sadat and Arafat, Camp David 2000. What was the difference? The difference was leadership. Sadat wanted to make peace. He prevailed over the advice of his advisors and signed a peace treaty. Arafat also unfortunately prevailed over the advice of his advisors who said sign the peace treaty because you will not get a better deal. And he was against it. Now Hamas wassome, all the land that we occupied from Jordan and there is a peace between against Arafat. They did not even believe in any negotiations. They are against, and they were against Oslo, why? Because they do not believe in Israel’s right to exist. They do not believe in coexistence, they do not believe in peace. They do not believe even, in a democracy. Because they would like to have one Islamist Palestinian country a la Iran, Iran style and under the Sharia, the, the, the law of, of Islam. So lets go back to the debate tonight. What is the definition of terror? Killing intentionally of innocent people. What does Hamas do? Killing only, only children and innocent people. They stand terrorists strapped in explosives into markets, into pizzerias, into coffee shops, and into school buses and kindergartens. This is what they do. Are they a terrorist organization? If this is the definition of terror, they definitely are a terrorist organization. Secondly, do they believe in coexistence? No, they deny Israel’s right to exist. Now people here are talking about whether elected democratically or not, this is besides the point. Just look into the Hamas, www.hamas.com in their website on the internet and look into the Hamas charter. They believe in killing, they don’t believe in Israel, they don’t believe in any peace. So are they a terror organization? According to this definition, they are as well. Now there is another issue here. Who is Hamas operated by? Are they really doing the will of the people? I don't think so. My esteemed colleague here on the other side, Stanley Cohen said he just returned from Damascus and he met Khaled Meshaal? Where did he meet Khaled Meshaal? In Damascus. Who is really operating Khaled Meshaal? The Syrians, and the Iranians. So they’re not really playing. They’re not really representing Palestinian authentic interest. They are representing the interest of this crazy Islamist in Iran, and in Damascus. Are they a terror organization? I think yes, I think all of you should vote for this motion. Now there is this question whether they were democratically elected. Well I would say a broad definition of democracy is you know, doing the will of the people but also observing the rule of law. And the rule of law does not permit gangs to be brandishing their guns and going with bullets into the ballots. Uh, don’t take just the case of Hamas. Look at what happens. I mean we should apply this global world, global community, the same yardstick for everywhere. There were elections held in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in the former Yugoslavia. In all these elections, armed gangs were denied the right of voting and also of being elected. The same case should have been with Hamas but for some reason, this thing was ignored and Hamas was allowed to run. And I think this was a mistake. Unfortunately, Hamas won but it’s not because the people voted for their ideology –It’s because it was a protest vote against Fatah which was corrupt and ineffective. So this is the reason why Hamas was elected. Did it change their character? Not at all. Does a formal process change intrinsically what Hamas stand for? Now after the elections, they still are killing. There are more than a thousand rockets fired from Gaza into our towns, killing babies and children, and there’s no reason for that since we left Gaza entirely. We left Gaza entirely in order to give Palestinians a chance to show everybody that they can govern themselves responsibly. That they can do away with terror and incitement and start negotiation with us. Just vote for the motion."

    "data":"The problem, the problem isn’t that Hamas is a terrorist organization. The problem is that Hamas is a Muslim organization, that’s what scares the hell out of us. And we ought to put it all out on the table and just say it. And how do we know that? Because the United States has dealt with terrorist organizations throughout its history and so has Israel. There were no preconditions for any talks with the PLO in 1993. And Yasser Arafat made sure of that. He said, we’ll recognize you after you talk to us. That was no preconditions. Why do we have conditions on Hamas? Because they’re Muslims, they don’t look like us, we say they don’t have our values. How do I know that we deal with terrorist organizations? Because tomorrow the president of the United States is meeting with a man by the name of Nouri al-Maliki. Who is he? Nouri al-Maliki is the head of the Dawa Party. Who is the Dawa Party? The Dawa Party opposed Saddam Hussein when we supported Saddam Hussein. We put them on the terrorism list. When we changed sides, we took them off the terrorism list. That doesn’t matter. They bombed the US Embassy in Kuwait and killed three Americans. We’re talking to him because it’s in our interest to talk to him, terrorist or not. So what is the problem with Hamas? Well if you listen to the media and if you listen to our political leaders, here’s what they have to say. They don’t have our values. Our Judeo-Christian values. What values would those be? I'm a nice white boy from Wisconsin, grew up as a Lutheran. And I can tell you in my religion and I had to memorize through an ordeal the catechism of Martin Luther, one of the real anti-Semites of our era. They do not have a legitimacy. How do political parties and movements gain legitimacy? It’s not conferred by Israel or the United States as conferred by the people. They won an election. Oh no, their critics say. They didn’t win the election, Fatah lost it. Okay. Fatah lost it because Fatah couldn't organize itself credibly and competently to stand for election and because Fatah accepted twenty million dollars in American election aid. And as soon as that came out in The Washington Post and was reprinted in the West Bank in Gaza, they lost votes. They want to destroy Israel, so did the PLO. They have a charter that says they want to destroy Israel. So do the PLO. And yet we’ve had Hamas leaders that say the following. We have a charter that says, yes we admit it, we want to destroy Israel. But the charter’s not the Quran, and it can be changed. And under the right circumstances, if we can talk to our adversaries, we can and we will change it. The other argument that we say, we’ve heard it tonight. They provide social services. Oh cynical people, how could they do that? You mean they’re actually trying to serve their people, clear up corruption? I too was talking to Hamas leaders when I was in the Middle East. Just one week ago, Osama Hamdan, the foreign minister of Hamas, here’s what they’ve done. They’ve penetrated the Education Health Ministries, cleaned them up, that’s forty percent of the total employment of the government of Palestine. They’ve thrown out the corrupt people. They’ve taken over the Ministry, they’ve started to provide services to people. They’ve kicked out Fatah members who are in exile around the world for stealing money from the Palestinian people. Don’t we want good governance? Shouldn't we talk to people who want good governance, who stand for elections? They kill innocent people. They have killed innocent people, rudely, terribly, like others have. It’s not an excuse to say, well the Israelis have done it. Well Lehi did it. That’s not an excuse. They’ve killed innocent people and they come out to be absolved. But after long discussions with Hamas, conducted by my organization, painful discussions, arguments about the killing of innocents, not moral arguments, practical, effective, political arguments. They stopped. I’d like to take credit. They stopped these suicide bombers through talk because they realized how ineffective they were, how they were losing support for what they feel is a legitimate cause. There hasn’t been a Hamas-led suicide bombing in Israel since August of 2004. That’s a fact. People can change. There are three conditions for Hamas being recognized as a legitimate political party. To renounce violence, to give up their arms, and to recognize Israel. We’ve been through this and through this with Hamas, and we’ve said why don’t you do this? And the best answer that I’ve had from a Hamas leader is as followed. If we do that, if we renounce violence, if we give up our arms, and if we recognize Israel, what’s there to talk about? What do we talk to our enemies about? Do you think we’re going to say, oh welcome to the world of nations? Finally we’ll withdraw to the sixty-seven borders? Here’s what we would like. We will recognize Israel, Khaled Meshaal has said this very straight forward in Damascus again and again and again and again. We understand and we recognize that the Israeli people, the Jewish people have a narrative, it’s an important narrative. We’ve listened to it for many, many years. We have a narrative. Here’s our narrative. In 1948, we lived on a land that was called Palestine. Many of us were kicked off our land and now live in refugee camps. We have legitimate grievances. If you will recognize our legitimate grievances, and recognize our narrative as a people, we can begin to share a narrative, to have talks. But until that point comes, when you stand up and say we understand that you have grievances that have to be addressed, we’re not going to recognize anybody. We’re going to represent our people. Now here’s what’s happening, I think, in the Middle East. Now, and I just returned from Beirut. There are, on the internet, calls for the assassination of the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas by the leaders of Al Qaeda. Why? Because Hamas and Hezbollah have accepted the western, colloidal mandate, to stand for elections and represent their people. Al Qaeda thinks that’s a trick. Hamas and Hezbollah don’t. They answer to their people. We are lumping together the Girondists with the Jacobins. We are lumping together the true reformers in the Middle East, the ones who want to answer to their people with the people who drove their airplanes into our buildings. We are forcing the Gironde –for those of you who remember French history – into the mountain, into the Jacobins. It is, it is so counterproductive. We are radicalizing the region. There are moderates in Islam. They’re called Hamas whether we like it or not. And it’s time to open up to them. I thank you."

    "data":"Thank you. It's an honor to be here tonight, particularly on this stage with Peter and Max, who are all acknowledged experts in this field. Also a little daunting. I've done a lot of panels. I've never done a debate with clocks and buzzers and voting. So cut me some slack. I'm also local. I'm from Jersey, if that helps in the voting process as well. But I just want to say also, too, if there're any Marines in the room, happy birthday Marines. Today is the 235th birthday of the Marine Corps. [applause] And it's appropriate to be having this discussion tonight because, you know, so far this year in Afghanistan, or so far this month in Afghanistan, the first ten days in November, we've seen 16 service members killed, many of them marines. So it's important for us to have a discussion on a day like this because it's those service members and their families who are bearing the direct costs of this conflict. You're going to hear tonight a lot of nuanced and complex arguments between us. And that's about right because the United States is entangled in a very complicated situation. To use the term civil war is not incorrect. You're going to hear us disagree on the relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaeda. I found, in my experience, in both eastern and southern Afghanistan, that the vast, vast majority of the Taliban that are fighting our troops every day are not wedded to an ideology that al-Qaeda embraces, that they are fighting occupation, and they are not fighting for some type of transnational jihad. You will see us disagree over the similarities between the Iraq and Afghan surge. Again, I was in both. I was fully invested in the Iraq surge in 2006 in Anbar province, I was one of the first civilian surge members last year into Afghanistan. And there are similarities between the Iraq surge and the Afghan surge. But those similarities are more in terms of how the US is doing policy and how we didn't do things right to begin with in Iraq and now all those policies we're doing wrong in Afghanistan. And I look forward to a discussion. I know Nir's got a lot of comments on this, and I look forward to having this talk with Peter and Max. You're also going to hear a lot of facts, figures and statistics tonight. And I want you to keep in mind the big picture. I want you to ask, so what? After every fact or figure or statistic you hear. Hopefully when Peter and Max say it and not when Nir and I say it, because it's just a case of don't lose sight or track of the forest because of the trees. And so keep in mind, bear in mind some basic aspects of the war in Afghanistan. The cost. Last year we spent -- the United States spent $104 billion in Afghanistan. This year, we are projected to spend $119 billion in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's GDP is $14 billion. We are spending seven times as much in that country as it's worth. As the Dutch, the Canadian, probably the French and Italians move out of Afghanistan, of course, our costs will go up. And so when you hear the administration say, we're looking at keeping this policy in place till 2014, that's a half trillion price tag plus about 2400 dead American and coalition soldiers as well as thousands more Afghans at this pace. Keep in mind that since 2005, we have seen a fivefold increase in U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan. Literally every year since 2005, we have doubled the foreign troop presence in Afghanistan. And what's occurred from that is that only every year a commensurate rise in violence, a commensurate rise in support for the Taliban and a decrease in support for the Karzai government. You see this with a number of Taliban. In 2005, we estimated there are 2000 active duty fighters in Afghanistan. Now we're estimating there are 35 to 40,000 active duty Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. So not only is the policy expensive, failing, it's also counterproductive because it's causing people to join the insurgency. It's exasperating the conflict, and it's making the region less stable. And that includes Pakistan. Additionally, keep in mind the nature of al-Qaeda. Keep in mind it is only 50 to a hundred members of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, according to our CIA. And contrast that with the 1,000 -- the 2,000 members of al-Qaeda that our State Department said are still in Iraq in their report last August on terrorism. Contrast that with the fact that the German police say there are 45 members of al-Qaeda in Hamburg, Germany. Hamburg being the place that probably had as much to do with the planning, if not more, for the 9/11 attacks than Afghanistan. And before I forget to put a plug in for a great article on the nature of al-Qaeda on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and on 9/11, please read the “New Yorker” article from September by Terry McDermott. Really shows how al-Qaeda is this grouping of individuals. that with the 1,000 -- the 2,000 members of al-Qaeda that our State Department said are still in Iraq in their report last August on terrorism.

    "data":"Thank you very much, John. It's a pleasure to be here. And I'd like to extend my sympathies to our distinguished opponents on the other side. I know they will make a valiant attempt as you've already heard Matt do, but I'm very sorry to say they have an impossible burden of proof today. They have to convince you that it's impossible for America and our allies to prevail in Afghanistan, that there is no way we can achieve our objective, which isn't to create paradise on earth, but merely an Afghanistan that is free of terrorist safe havens and that can secure and govern itself. For our part, we don't have to convince you that success is assured; only that it's possible. For anyone familiar with military history, that ought to be a no-brainer. Numerous countries have won wars after overcoming obstacles far more severe than those we face today. Think of Britain standing alone against the Nazis in 1940. Think of U.S. forces almost being pushed off the Green Peninsula in the summer of 1950, or more recently, think of Iraq in 2006. Now, you will hear, as you've already heard from Matt, our opponents say that Afghanistan isn't Iraq. And they're right. Iraq was much worse. In 2006 Iraq was in the throes of a full-blown civil war. That year 34,000 civilians died, Shi’a and Sunni terrorists had high levels of support in their sectarian communities, Prime Minister Maliki’s government was implicated in death squad activity, and back home the Democrats won majorities in Congress on an antiwar platform. Even many supporters of the war effort thought we were on the brink of defeat. For example, on August 9th of 2006, I wrote in the L.A. Times, Bush needs to do something radical to shake up a deteriorating status quo if we are to have any hope of averting the worst American military defeat since Vietnam.” Luckily President Bush did do something radical. He ordered a surge which turned around a war effort which many had written off as hopeless. Today another surge is just starting, and it actually has better prospects of success because the situation in Afghanistan is objectively much better than it was in Iraq. Yes, civilian casualties are up, but they're still 1/16th as high as they were in Iraq. Yes, violence has spread, but 63 percent of attacks still happen in just three provinces. Yes, there is the stress among ethnic groups. We are not facing a civil war. This is an intra-Pashtun conflict. Yes, Hamid Karzai is a problematic leader, but at least he is not running death squads and he has cooperated on important initiatives such as the village security program. And, yes, public opinion has turned against the war, but President Obama will receive a lot more support from Republicans than President Bush received from Democrats. I am also relatively optimistic about Afghanistan because the armed forces have gotten much better at counterinsurgency. The COIN strategy that General Petraeus is implementing today draws not only on the war in Iraq, but also in conflicts as diverse as Columbia, El Salvador, Malaya, and the Philippines. He is not only focusing on kinetic operations, killing the enemy, but also on improving governance, intelligence collection, the handling of detainees, information operations and much more. It’s a huge difference from the sleepy days of 2008 when there were only 32,000 U.S. troops in the country and they were stuck in a holding pattern. Now we have a hundred thousands troops there. The last of the surge forces only arrived in September but already they’re making a difference. This summer I visited Nawa in Helmand province. Before the Marines got there in 2009, it was a virtual ghost town dominated by the Taliban. Today, it’s safe enough to walk around without body armor. Stores and schools have reopened, electrical lines are going up. Agricultural canals are being cleared. This is tangible progress. Similar operations are now in full-swing around Kandahar, the heartland of the Taliban. The New York Times, hardly a pro-war organ, reported on October 20, “American and Afghan forces have been routing the Taliban in much of Kandahar Province in recent weeks forcing many hardened fighters to flee strongholds they have held for years.” We are also seeing stepped-up operations to capture or kill Taliban and Haqqani leaders. In the past 90 days, Special Operations forces have carried out more than 1,500 operations resulting in the death or capture of almost 3,800 insurgents. Air strikes have more than doubled over the past year and yet according to the U.N., civilian deaths from NATO bombings were down 64 percent in the first half of the year. That’s a tribute to the very careful rules of engagement promulgated by General McChrystal and General Petraeus something that distinguishes us greatly from the way the Red Army or others have fought in Afghanistan. To win over the population, coalition forces are also working to improve governance and cut corruption. A lot of the corruption in Afghanistan has been fueled by our own money. In the years when we have few troops there, we contracted out security to warlords who abused the people and drove them into the arms of the Taliban. Now that is changing. We are less reliant on warlords and General Petraeus is striving to ensure that our spending doesn’t fuel corruption. A lot of the focus today is on avoiding bottlenecks in Kabul by working in the provinces where the troops are assisted by a civilian surge with the number of civilian U.S. government employees there having gone up three times in the past year, three fold. Perhaps the most important line of operations is the training of Afghan security forces, the ANSF. That’s our ticket out of Afghanistan. As they stand up, we can draw down responsibly as we’ve done in Iraq. We don’t need to stay until Afghanistan is as peaceful as Switzerland, only until it can be secured by its own troops. And how is the ANSF training going? Well let me quote you again from The New York Times on October 12 .Which said that “Long a lagging priority, the plan to produce many more trained Afghan troops is moving this fall at a rapid pace. ANSF numbers have jumped from 137,000 in 2008 to 258,000 today and their quality is higher because of smaller class sizes and more intensive mentoring. Salaries are up, desertion rates are down.” Now I don’t want to over-estimate the progress that has occurred or under-estimate the problems that remain. There is no doubt that we face a long, hard fight. But the biggest thing we have on our side is public opinion. My colleague Peter Bergen will tell you more about this. But the fact is the Afghans have experienced Taliban rule and they didn’t like it. Fewer than 10 percent say they want a return to the Taliban. More than 60 percent support the NATO troop presence. Again, John, this is not the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. We have the people on our side. Is Afghanistan a lost cause?  President Obama doesn’t think so. Otherwise he wouldn’t have sent more than 50,000 additional troops there. General Petraeus doesn’t think so. Otherwise he wouldn’t have accepted a command that could tarnish his sterling legacy. We don’t think so either. I look forward to hearing from our opponents to see how they can possibly prove otherwise. Thank you. "

    "data":"Max said that our goal in Afghanistan is to make sure it’s a terrorist safe haven-free country. In a sense, we did that. In 2001 and 2002, we got rid of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. So I'm not sure why we're still there. He also said that Iraq was worse than Afghanistan during the civil war. That's true. And Iraq is still worse than Afghanistan today. So where is our success in Iraq? You have more civilians being killed in Iraq today than you do in Afghanistan today. This is after the surge. Now, people like to forget about Iraq, and the media has certainly forgotten about it. But I think we can't understand what's happening in Afghanistan and what the Americans think they're doing in Afghanistan without understanding what really happened in Iraq. The surge is this narrative that things were going badly. You have the 2006 Samarra shrine incident where the shrine was blown up, the civil war broke out. And then this genius general called David Petraeus came up with a new way of fighting a war, and that solved the problem. None of that is really true. Robert also mentioned that Petraeus wrote the counterinsurgency manual. That's not really true, either. He signed his name at the bottom of it, but he actually had hundreds of other people involved in the process and probably corrected a few spelling mistakes. But you have all kind of academics and officers involved in that process. Now, the civil war in Iraq, the people that won the civil war weren't the American forces. It was Black and Decker. What do I mean by that, whenever you find a corpse in Iraq that was beheaded, you knew it was killed by a Sunni militiaman. If you find the corpse with Black and Decker power drill marks in it, Shia militiamen killed it. And what defeated the Sunni insurgency in Iraq was not the American surge. It was Shia militiamen in collaboration with the Iraqi police and the Iraqi army who brutally crushed the Sunni population, Not just with power drills, but also with executions and rape with full knowledge of the Americans. There was a Shia colonel in west Baghdad called Sabah [spelled phonetically], an army criminal who used to kidnap men, Sunni men, and then force their wives to have sex with them in order to release these men. Beginning in 2006, this was about six months before Petraeus came into Iraq, I began to meet Iraqi resistance leaders in Baghdad, in Syria, in Jordan. And suddenly, they were saying, “We lost, we lost.” And why did they lose? Because the Shia had depopulated Sunni areas brutally, a sort of brutality that the Americans could never use. So we were killing innocent civilians but not in these rates. At the same time, you had a total separation of Sunni and Shia civilians thanks to the civil war. One side won the civil war, the Shias, one side lost, the Sunnis. And Sunni neighborhoods in Baghdad became, very often, virtual ghost towns. This is all six months before the surge started. And I was just in Iraq about a month ago. I was at Diyala province, where in July 2007, seven months after the surge began, hundreds of villages were destroyed. Al-Qaeda guys would come in there and total [unintelligible] the village, blow up all the houses, slaughter the men, likewise Shia militiamen were doing the same thing to Sunni villages. Seven months after the surge, violence was still peaking. What changed, apart from the Sunni realization that they lost was the Shia cease fire. The Shia militiamen, the Mahdi army declared a ceasefire, and violence dropped significantly after that. At the same time, you had a government that actually had some legitimacy because they would, a year later, go after the Shia militiamen, totally destroying them as well. Now, none of the factors that helped reduce violence in Iraq to the terrible levels where they are today, still worse than Afghanistan, none of these factors even exist in Afghanistan. First of all, the Sunnis in Iraq who dominated the insurgency, were 20 percent of the population. And they were destroyed and brutalized and turned into refugees in Syria and Jordan and elsewhere. The insurgency is Afghanistan is dominated by Pashtuns, 38 to 40 percent of the population, the largest group in Afghanistan. And they are not being brutalized. The Taliban is not a Pashtun movement, but it's dominated by Pashtuns. And they feel like they're on the rise. They have the momentum. They are spreading not only in Pashtun areas, but even in the north, among non-Pastuns, among Tajiks and Turkmen and Uzbeks, they’re reactivating old networks from the Taliban era. They feel like they’re doing quite well. Likewise, Baghdad was the prize in the civil war in Iraq. It was the dense, urban areas. The Americans could take each neighborhood in Baghdad and build immense walls around them, and really control the population. In Afghanistan it’s a rural insurgency. We might be focusing on the cities Kandahar, Kabul, Lashkar Gah--the Russians did the same thing. Most of the population of Afghanistan is in the villages. The Taliban are in the villages, just like the Mujahideen in the '80s were in the villages. We're making the same mistakes that the Russians were making, trying to control the cities and thinking that somehow we'll defeat the Mujahideen and the Taliban who are in the rural areas. Now, in Iraq, we had a government that somehow had some legitimacy. They represented the majority of the people. They crushed the Shia militias. In Afghanistan -- a key element in American counterinsurgency thinking is that you have to build the capacity of the government so it can spread its power and control the population. But in Afghanistan, the government is the problem. It's predatory, it's corrupt. It's lacking any credibility. It’s the best recruiter for the Taliban. So the last thing we want to do is ally ourselves and tie ourselves to this Afghan government which is hated by most of the population. The police, when they're not doing drugs, the Afghan police are stealing from stores, are demanding taxes at checkpoints. The Afghan army, I was with the Americans in the surge of 2009. The Afghan army didn't show up. They're [unintelligible] Afghan police. This time in Kandahar, the Afghan army didn't show up again. We've spent billions on the Afghan army. We, as taxpayers should be upset about this. And who's fighting on our side in Kandahar today? It's not the Afghan army. It is Colonel Raziq from the border police, a brutal warlord who brutalized the population of Kandahar a few years ago and turned many people, such as the Noorzai clan, against the U.S. and joined the Taliban. We've gone back to the same guy, Colonel Raziq, not the army, recruited a warlord. Where is the Afghan army? They just decided not to show up. We don't know what happened to our billions of dollars. So you don't have a government with any legitimacy or any prospect of legitimacy. You don't have any sign that you're defeating the insurgency or that you're punishing the population. In fact, there's only one counterinsurgency campaign that's ever worked in history. That was the British in Malaya. And why did that work? The British basically took half a million ethnic Chinese, put them in concentration camps and took them away from their homes. So, sure, we can do that in Afghanistan. We could defeat the Taliban. We could massively depopulate Pashtun areas and be genocidal about it. Short of that, there's just no evidence to date that we can do anything better. Nine years into this, every year, things have gotten worse and worse. This year is the worst year so far. Next year is guaranteed to be worse. The violence is spreading. Taliban control about 80 percent of the country right now. We are hated. In my travels, I was shocked -- I was in Afghanistan last January and February. And I was shocked to see that school teachers, local government officials, bus drivers were all complaining to me about the Americans and their night raids and their operations killing civilians. I don't think the American people know the extent to which the Afghans resent their presence or feel humiliated by it. "

    "data":"First I want to salute the service of Matthew Hoh both in Afghanistan and Iraq. And I want to salute Nir Rosen's brave and enterprising reporting. It's very good to be on this stage with them and my colleague Max. And let's remind -- Max at the beginning said what this motion was about. This motion is not about Afghanistan is kind of not going well. This motion is not about we're kind of not doing so well. We're sort of losing. This is -- the motion is about Afghanistan is a lost cause. Now, that is a pretty high bar that they have to prove. And so far we've heard a lot about Iraq, not much about Afghanistan, and some pretty easy to disprove assertions that they've made when they talked about Afghanistan. And some things that they didn't even talk about, I'm surprised. You know, the graveyard of empires cliche, for instance. They didn't bring this up. Well, turns out that many empires have gone into Afghanistan and done pretty well. The only empire that didn't do well there was the Soviets for the very good reason that they, as my colleague Max point out, they killed a million Afghans, made 5 million of them homeless. A successful counterinsurgency operation is exactly what we're doing and what the Soviets did not do. Rather, the small numbers of Afghan civilians are dying in this war, too many to be sure. But we're talking, instead of millions, as happened under the Soviets, hundreds. And as Max pointed out, the numbers are dropping, particularly because of our rules of engagement.  We heard from Nir that Afghanistan is a very violent place. Well, actually, you're more likely to be murdered in my hometown of Washington, D.C. than you are to be killed in the war in Afghanistan right now. Last year, about 3,000 Afghan civilians were killed in the war, population of 30 million. But you're more likely to be murdered in the United States in 1991 just generally than you are to be killed in the war in Afghanistan right now. It is simply not that violent. In fact, my wife is sitting here. We met in Afghanistan. You can actually have quite a good time in Kabul. It's a relatively peaceful place. There are restaurants, there are bars. You can have a regular social life, which, by the way, you could never have in Baghdad. And if you look at the murder rates in countries like Mexico, Venezuela, Columbia, and Russia, they're much, much higher than the death rate from the war in Afghanistan. We're not saying that Washington, D.C. is a lost cause. Maybe some people might say that. But we're not saying that Russia is a lost cause, we're not saying that Columbia is a lost cause, we're not saying that Mexico is a lost cause, we're not saying Venezuela is a lost cause, yet our opponents are suggesting it's a lost cause. And this is ridiculous. Another thing we've heard, of course, if the Karzai government is corrupt, and inefficient, and incompetent, sure, no doubt, but let's look at the neighborhood. To his west he has Iran with Ahmadinejad, who's a Holocaust denier. We don't need to say much more about him. To his north he has Karimov, of Uzbekistan, who boils people alive as a sort of forensic technique. To his west we have the military dictatorship on and off of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, the President, who's Mr. 10 percent because he takes at least 10 percent of everything. And so if you look at the neighborhood he's in, this is -- Karzai is looking pretty good. And he actually won at the most recent election. Sure, it wasn't the fairest election in history. But he's winning elections. I mean, this is a democracy. Look at the neighborhood. And, in fact, Freedom House, which looks at political freedoms around the world, judges that Afghanistan is about as free as any of the immediate neighbors. And look at Afghan history, think about Karzai's predecessor for a second, the warlords, the Taliban, Najibullah, the Communist dictator, and, of course, the Soviets. By that standard, both regionally and historically, Karzai is looking pretty good. One of the weakest arguments that our opponents didn't even bring up is that foreign forces in Afghanistan are always antibodies. Well, Nir did say that we're hated. BBC, hardly pro-American, generally speaking, news organization, found that 68 percent of Afghans last year had a favorable view of the U.S. military. Well, you probably can't find 68 percent of the inhabitants of the upper west side who have a favorable view of the U.S. military. And yet the Afghans do, and that number used to be 85 percent. Sure, we're losing some of our popularity, but we are still liked. They don't want us to go. They want us to perform on the promises that we seem to have given them early on that we would bring a more relatively prosperous and stable place. And since at the heart of a counterinsurgency is the views of the population, the population is very much on our side. Matthew mentioned that we can't afford this war. Well, we're spending $100 billion on the war. That's one percent of GDP. Between Vietnam we spent 10 percent of our GDP on the war. And I think this money's well-spent. First off, the numbers are going to go down as we spend less money and we have fewer troops. Secondly, just -- we were sitting in New York, and my wife and I just toured the Trade Center site this morning, and, you know, that cost 3,000 American lives, and it cost $500 billion, and it [unclear] affects the American economy, five percent of our GDP, had a devastating effect on so many of us in this room. And, you know, to make sure that al-Qaeda cannot come back to Afghanistan is money very, very well-spent, and the idea that the Taliban and al-Qaeda are not somehow allied is ridiculous. Anybody in this room who recalls the May, 2010, attempt in Times Square by a guy called Faisal Shahzad to blow up an SUV to kill dozens of people on a Saturday night at 6:00, luckily it didn't work out, well, he came from the Pakistani Taliban, which is a group that has been infected ideologically by al-Qaeda. And the fact that al-Qaeda is a relatively small group doesn’t mean very much at all because on 9/11 al-Qaeda only consisted of 200 people. And yet it did all this damage to us. What the problem with al-Qaeda is, is its ability to reinfect ideologically other groups, and the Taliban is one of them. And let's also accentuate the positive for a second. There are millions of Afghans back in school, of course, many of them girls, one in six Afghans have cell phones, perhaps as sort of a debatable form of progress, but one nonetheless in the sense where in a country that didn’t have a phone system at all. Their GDP growth rate in Afghanistan in 2007 was 14 percent. It’s gone down just as every other economy has recently. Former Afghan refugees returned home. Refugees do not return to places they don’t think have a future. And so there are many positive indicators about what’s going on. And let me give you -- there’s a very common polling question is: Do you have a positive view of the future? And, now, when Americans were asked that in the closing days of the Bush administration, only 17 percent of Americans said, I have a positive view of the future. Understandable, why? The country was in the worst depression since the Great Depression. Well, when Afghans were asked this just recently, 70 percent of them said, I have a favorable view of the future. And that’s because they’ve lived through the Taliban. I was there under the Taliban. I was there during the Civil War. What is going on now is obviously better than what happened before. And Afghans don’t think their countries are a lost cause, so why should we think that? "

    "data":"Good evening. Where are the results? No results yet? Anyway, can Israel live with a nuclear Iran? The short answer is yes. Any questions? Okay. But the real question is not this one. The real question, do we have another choice? And unfortunately, the answer is no. Because it's possible, despite all pressures and sanctions and even if there will be an Israeli military attack that in this decade, Iran will have nuclear weapons. So the question is for the Israeli policymakers, what then? What will be our policy in this case when Iran will have the weapons? Unfortunately there is -- as I said, there are no public debates on this, so we don't know what they think over there about future policy. What should Israel do when there will be a hostile Iran with nuclear weapons? The most effective and maybe the only way to deter Iran is to abandon our ambiguity, nuclear ambiguity and to move towards unconcealed nuclear deterrence. And since, in Israel, we have censorship, as you know, I have to play the game. And when I refer to Israeli nuclear deterrence, Israeli nuclear weapons, Israeli nuclear submarines with nuclear missiles, it's all according to foreign sources. I don't know anything. And I have to use this phrase, according to foreign sources. But Israel has to change its policy and to move, as I say, to nuclear deterrence -- with new rules of the game. And the other side should know what are the rules of the game. There will be red lines so the Iranians will understand it. For example, if Israel will detect a ballistic missile launched in Iran going westerly, for Israel, it will be the nuclear missiles. And in this case, Israel will not wait to see whether it is a nuclear missile or not. Automatically Israel will launch its nuclear missiles, according to foreign sources, and it, Tehran-- [unintelligible], it's fine and so on and so on. And it should be clear for the other side what will happen. And then the Ayatollahs in Tehran will have to decide whether to launch their missiles when they know exactly what will happen. What will happen, that Iran will be destroyed, and we'll go back to the Middle Ages. And I don't see any Iranian national interests that justifies this cost. So I believe that we can deter them. I believe that the other team will use the argument of irrationality. We cannot deter these extremist Muslim Ayatollahs. And if this is the case, we cannot deter them, then Netanyahu is right, and we have to attack. But I don't think this is the case, because if we have a very clear policy of nuclear deterrence, then the chances that the other side will use the weapons are very slim or not existent. For this, we'll have to change not just the policy. We have to show and declare our second-strike capability in order to show the Iranians what we have. And again, according to foreign sources, we have submarines, dolphin class with nuclear missiles. So we have second-strike capability, probably. So when they use the argument of irrationality, everybody goes to the Cold War and say the Ayatollahs are not like the leaders of the two super powers. They are not rational. They are not going to act like the Soviet leaders or the American leaders, which is wrong, I believe, because if you can remember, during the Cold War, Stalin was perceived, even in the states, as a madman -- whenever he has the bomb he is going to drop the bomb. And the Ayatollahs are not like this. And it seems from professional and sober analysis that the Iranians will -- if we'll learn their way of thinking, their culture, their history, they are going to act like real rational leaders. We should understand that the development of the Iranian nuclear weapons is not against Israel. It's based on their experience during the war, the Iran-Iraq war in the '80s, not against Israel. And it's very important to understand it, what is the base of their thinking about their nuclear program. And ironically, possession of nuclear weapons may moderate the Iranian leadership, exactly what happened with the Chinese leadership in '64 when they got their nuclear weapons, and they started acting like rational state. And another example is India and Pakistan. Only 23 seconds more. So India and Pakistan, there were three wars, after they acquired their nuclear weapons in '98, about after a year there was the Kargil crisis, and they acted very rationally in order not to deteriorate the situation in using the nuclear war.

    "data":"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, John. Thank you to Intelligence Squared. Thank you for coming. Thank you, Reuven. I -- as someone who's covered Pakistan extensively, I'm not going to sit here and make believe that I would hold up Pakistan as a model of stability -- and rational nuclear deterrence, but we can talk about that later. Since you brought up this subject of the nature of the Iranian regime and what they believe and what they think and what they seek, let's talk about that for a minute. What do we have in -- right now in the world? It's a genuinely unprecedented situation, certainly unprecedented in the post-World War II international order. We have a member state of the United Nations, the Islamic Republic of Iran, that actively calls for the destruction of another member state of the United Nations. That is Israel. And they're very, very clear and consistent on this subject right from the beginning of the Islamic Republic. I'll give you a couple of examples. This is from the supreme leader of Iran, who, as his title suggests, is the supreme leader -- he's the guy who sets the policy. Quote, this is from last February, The Zionist regime is a true cancer tumor on this region that should be cut off, and it definitely will be cut off. Its feelings are echoed regularly among the Iranian, and military, and intelligence elite. I'll give you another example. General Gholam Reza Jalali, the former commander of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, said last August, I quote, The fact is, is that there is no other way but to stand firm and resist until Israel is destroyed. General Hassan Firouzbadi, the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, said last May, and I quote, The Iranian nation is standing for its cause, which is the full annihilation of Israel. Finally, Mohammad Hassan Rahimian [spelled phonetically], who is a top aide to Khamenei, said in the January 2010 television interview, quote, We have manufactured missiles that allow us when necessary to replace Israel in its entirety with a big holocaust. Mr. Rahimian is the deputy minister for subtlety on the part -- of the Iranian regime. Iranian opposition to Israel's existence is not only ideological and rhetorical, we have to remember that in addition to actually calling for the destruction of the Jewish state, the Iranian regime works to destroy individual Jews. Hezbollah, the Lebanese terror group, is a proxy of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The rocket that it fires periodically into Israel are Iranian manufacture. The rockets that Hamas fires from Gaza very recently are Iranian rockets. Let's not forget in the last year you have multiple examples around the world of Iranians trying to kill Israelis, in Bulgaria, in Azerbaijan, in Georgia, in Thailand. And let's not forget a fact I find very amazing, which is that the current defense minister of Iran is actually sought by international law enforcement authorities for direct complicity in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Argentina. So you're dealing with a regime that regularly calls for the annihilation of the Jewish state. You're dealing with a regime that seeks to destroy and kill individual Jews, which begs the question, What would be the impact on Middle East stability and on the safety of Israel if this regime which seeks their annihilation, states very plainly it seeks the annihilation of the Jewish state, were to gain a weapon that would help it actually bring about that annihilation? And that's the question that we're dealing with today. Now, there are three ways to sort of deal with this dilemma, I think. The first is to -- is to, sort of, say, yeah, you know, on the one hand it's true, the Iranian regime is the foremost sponsor of terrorism in the world and it denies the holocaust while calling for a new holocaust. And it executes people for being gay and it threatens Christian pastors with execution unless they convert to Islam. And it's responsible for a quarter of the American combat deaths in Iraq, and it hides many leaders of al-Qaeda within its borders. But, on the other hand, no one's perfect and I'm sure that these, you know, gay-hanging, Christian-persecuting, American-killing, Jew-hating mullahs, if they get hold of a bomb, will behave in a responsible, rational, and enlightened way. The second response is what I call the, for lack of a better term, the Uncle Morty response, because a lot of us have an uncle Morty sitting in Boca who spends all day on the internet trying to prove that Barack Obama is Osama bin Laden's third cousin by marriage. And the Uncle Morty response -- the Uncle Morty response is to say You know, it's 1938 and the second holocaust is beginning next Tuesday and we're all done, and we're finished. The third response -- and this is what I want to get into during the course of this debate. The third response acknowledges a couple things. Is that it isn't 1938. The Jewish people do not stand defenseless and naked before the world. Iran, the day after it gets a bomb will probably not fire that single bomb at Israel, but it's also clear that Israel in a post-nuclear Iran Middle East is going to have a very, very hard time surviving.  Three quick reasons why it's going to have a hard time surviving: my colleague, Shmuel, in a few minutes is going to talk about why the Cold War models of mutual deterrence don't really apply in this situation. I'm going to talk about reasons that it's going to be difficult for Israel to survive even if there is no nuclear propagation. The first is very clear to everyone, including President Obama. The day after there's going to be -- the day after Iran goes nuclear, there's going to be an arms race, a nuclear arms race, in the Middle East. President Obama has warned about this. He said very explicitly that a nuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region is inherently destabilizing. So you're dealing with, in a few years' time, the possibility that four or five different countries that all hate each other, are going to be pointing nuclear tipped missiles at each other. That's not a recipe for stability or happiness; it's certainly not a recipe for stability for the Jewish state. Second reason: if you believe that Israel can only survive if it makes peace with its neighbors, then you will be opposed to the idea of Iran getting a nuclear bomb. Israel cannot survive in a Middle East in which America is a defeated and weakened ally. America is Israel's most important ally. If Iran trumps America, if Iran beats America by getting a nuclear weapon, it means that the Arab states that were predisposed to make peace with Israel -- and we know the peace process is [unintelligible]. Anyway, they will align with Iran, because Iran is the winner of that conflict. The third and most obvious point is Hamas and Hezbollah, even now, periodically fire large numbers of rockets at Israeli civilians. Imagine the power that they will have when they can fire those rockets under the protection of the Iranian nuclear umbrella. Again, there is a real chance that an Iranian nuclear weapon would lead to conflagration in the Middle East. Even without that conflagration, it becomes very, very hard to envision how Israel survives in the long term. Thank you very much. "

    "data":"Well, just to remind us what we're debating about. The proposition is, can Israel live with a nuclear Iran, can Israel survive a nuclear Iran. The answer to that question is yes. You don't need to be absolutely certain it will survive. In fact, technically, you don't even think it has to be probable that it'll survive, just that it's possible that it will survive. And I think both of the opposition will acknowledge that it's possible it'll survive. And Jeff said that they'd have a hard time, which implicitly indicates that there's a good possibility they'd survive it, it'd just be harder. But -- so I mean, I think if you debate at that level, it's pretty clear. There's almost nobody who thinks that Israel's demise will be automatic and certain. It's a question of risk. And so I think in a sense, the real debate is, should Israel live with a nuclear Iran. And the answer is, not if they can help it, obviously. Nobody thinks a nuclear Iran is a good idea. And we're already doing a lot to try to prevent it. We have a massive probably unprecedented international sanctions regime, an active, if so far unproductive diplomatic process, a very active and somewhat successful covert sabotage effort and cyber attacks. Now, these may work in some combination. But I'd have to acknowledge that they may not. And so the remaining question is, should one of these fail, go to war to prevent Israel -- prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. And I think although that's not precisely what we're debating, the issue does tend to revolve around that. Now, the threshold for saying yes that we should go to war to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon really has to go -- there are two thresholds, one is efficacy, and one is unintended consequences. You need to look at both. In terms of efficacy, I think most experts believe that an Israeli attack on Iran would set the program back by perhaps two years. That an American attack would be more effective and would set it back by maybe four or five years. It wouldn't prevent it, but it would slow it down. What about the unintended consequences? Well, most people are concerned about the possibility of counter attacks. Iran begins rocketing Israel -- Israeli nuclear facilities, terrorist attacks. But in many ways, the more dangerous response is, first of all, that an unprovoked attack on Iran validates their case for a nuclear weapon, for nuclear deterrence. North Korea doesn't suffer those kinds of attacks. Pakistan doesn't suffer those kinds of attacks. And many in the world and in Iran will come around to the view that maybe Iran actually needs a nuclear weapon. A second consequence is that you begin to collapse the international coalition that so far has made Iran a pariah state that has cut off its access to international markets, international -- not just nuclear technology, but any kind of military technology, and increasingly even cut back dramatically its oil sales. And as a result, Iran gains access to the world economy. It breaks out of its isolation. And even perhaps certainly gains access to sophisticated military technology. In the aftermath of an attack, wouldn't Russia be prepared to sell Iran the kind of air defense systems which so far it's refused to sell Iran and perhaps even nuclear technology from states like Pakistan or others, North Korea. I think in evaluating these consequences, one has to go back to the question of what is it that we, and for that matter, most Israelis, fear about Iran. And I think Jeff has pretty much answered that question. It's not Iranian invasion. It's Iranian subversion. It's Iran's capacity to appeal to militant elements within neighboring populations, dissident elements within neighboring populations in order to galvanize their efforts both against their own regimes in many cases and against Israel. So it's Iranian influence; it's Iranian capacity for subversion. It's not that Iran is going to march across two intervening states and invade Israel. That is a concern. And the fear is that they would be emboldened, and they'd do more of this.  But I think you have to ask yourself, which kind of Iran would have more influence with these dissident populations? Not with governments, but with dissident populations in places like Gaza and Lebanon and other Middle East states. An Iran that had nuclear weapons, or an Iran that was the victim of an unprovoked attack? Which of those two would give Iran greater influence and capacity to mobilize those kinds of populations? I think the answer to that is fairly clear. Now, the argument that Iran would be emboldened by possessing a nuclear weapon is certainly, I think, a real danger. But it's far from a certainty. It's not the historic pattern. You know, our major problems with the Soviet Union and particularly with China occurred before they had nuclear weapons. You know, Soviet Union gobbled up all of Eastern Europe before it had nuclear weapons. We had nuclear weapons, they didn't. China actually attacked the United States and Korea and made [unintelligible] a two-year war with the United States and Korea. They didn't have nuclear weapons; we did. Once they got nuclear weapons, we didn't have anymore wars. Now, we had lots of confrontations, but they were eventually defused. Both North Korea and Pakistan do behave irresponsibly on occasion, but there is a certain stability in their relations with India, Pakistan's relations with India, North Korea's relations with South Korea. There haven't been conflicts in either case. So the argument that they'd be emboldened to the point of actually threatening to use nuclear weapons or using nuclear weapons or even engaging in the kind of behavior that they're not engaging in now -- and I think if you listen to Jeff's list of all the things they're doing, you'd have to ask, what the hell else could they do that they're not already doing? And I think the answer is not much. "

    "data":"Thank you. First of all, I won't go into the post-fact scenarios that were brought, but suffice to say that I could offer more optimistic scenarios. When you shuffle a deck of cards, then you play a completely new game. I recall that when we took out the Iraqi reactor we thought it would delay it for three years. But it took about 10 years, and the Iraqis did not get back to the level that they were before we took out the Osirak. Now, the arguments that have brought up the rational actor model, which I've already made some remarks as a historian about and the idea that deterrence works, and the other, the Cold War paradigm can be applied. I would argue that we have to look at both of these assumptions in a completely different manner. First of all, the rational actor model. Somebody, not me, McNamara, said that Castro was a rational man, Khrushchev was a rational man, Kennedy was a rational man. And three rational men almost brought their nations into utter destruction. And that was without any -- I mean, Che Guevara said that if Cuba had to be destroyed in order to destroy capitalism, then Cuba would be thankful for that. But in other words, rational people sometimes do things, or the dynamics between rational people, rational leaders, sometimes leads to things which are not rational. The other thing is that strategic surprises have happened. I don't think there's anybody here who would debate the fact that strategic surprises have happened. And when they happen, they happen because things that hordes of analysts and pundits and journalists have said are completely impossible because it is irrational that people will act that way, but they happened. So the fact is that these surprises happen, and they reflect dynamics which were not pure game theory rational behavior. Now, the other thing is that if nuclear weapons make countries more responsible, then I would propose that the United States, which wants to reduce its nuclear arsenal, should now just divvy out all of the American nuclear weapons to the whole world, and then everybody will become very responsible, very rational, and peace on earth and goodwill towards men. Now to the Cold War paradigm. The Cold War paradigm, let's define what it was. It was bilateral. It was a paradigm which, from a certain stage, had mutually assured destruction, with each party having a second-strike capability. It was with levels of intelligence that when these -- both the United States and Soviet Union acquired that capability, the second-strike capability, they also had satellites in the sky, so they had a reasonable picture of what was going on in the silos of their respective enemies. There were mutual communications after Cuba, and there was also a perception of a taboo after Hiroshima. Now, when we're talking about a nuclear Iran, we have to understand we are talking about a poly-nuclear Middle East. The nuclear Shiite Iran is going to be perceived by the Sunni countries as something that cannot be countenanced, that they are going to have to acquire their own nuclear weapons. In a poly-nuclear Middle East where every country has a very small arsenal, they do not have mutually assured destruction. They have sort of arsenal which is Use it or lose it. If we are attacked then we won't have a second chance. We are going to have multiple nuclear states with these small arsenals with very low levels of intelligence. They won't have satellite intelligence, a very clear picture of what the real intentions of their enemy are. The size of the arsenals, it's better to have a lot of bombs than a few bombs because then, of course, you have the propensity to say, Well, if I don't use it now, I won't have a second chance. But then I want to go into something which has to do with command and control. And this is a very esoteric area. But in order to prevent unintentional use of nuclear weapons or use of nuclear weapons without total control over the process of what's called escalation dominance, you have to have very sophisticated capabilities. When you look at the command and control structures in the various countries of the Middle East and the paradigms which existed in the Cold War countries, you actually discover that most of the key elements which were instrumental in preventing nuclear confrontation during the Cold War do not exist in the Middle East and cannot exist for various reasons, some of them because of the military culture, the political culture, et cetera, issues such as verification of authority, separation of authority over the delivery systems and the weapons, all of those things which made it more difficult suddenly to rush into nuclear confrontation, things like permissive action links which prevented unintentional use. So all put together, we are talking about a very volatile region. We're talking about a possibility that not because Khamenei gets up in the morning and says, Oh, what a lovely day, isn't it a great day to drop a bomb? but that because the Iranians do a nuclear alert, the Saudis don't know whether it's directed against them. Israel sees Saudi Arabia, and Iran, and Turkey on clear alert. Everybody goes on DEFCON, and things get out of hand because none of these countries have the capability to control this spiral of escalation. Now we're talking about something which is -- even if we say it's low probability, but low probability, high consequence, and this is where we stand on that. In other words, we can say, Oh, there's a 10 percent possibility that this will result in nuclear confrontation. Well, 10 percent probability of total destruction is something that you have to think about. So, putting all of that together, I think that I would agree with McNamara that rational actors or rational leaders do not guarantee complete rational processes. And as a final note, we also have to address the issue of the taboo of nuclear weapons. Religious experts in Iran and in the Sunni world all ask themselves, What is a nuclear bomb? Since there can be nothing which the prophet Muhammad didn't speak about, they have decided that a nuclear bomb is like a catapult, it's just a big catapult, because a catapult used to be thrown over the walls of a city and you didn't see who it killed so it's indiscriminate killing. Well, that's like a nuclear weapon. I think that somebody who sees a nuclear weapon like a catapult is "

    "data":"Well, it’s always nice to have a logistics glitch, because it gives you a tiny bit more time to think about what you might say of any interest. Um, let me start by saying something that isn't in the spirit of these debates, which is that I actually think there’s quite a large middle ground on this question, and I'm, you know, I don’t mind a good scrap, as any one of you who knows my work will know. But I don’t think that it’s simply a question of saying all aid is terrible or, or um, all aid is good, I think to the, you know, in the way that I want to invite you to vote for this, uh, resolution, it’s that on balance aid is, has done more harm, the resolution is well phrased, than good. It’s not that it’s a great, vast, you know, right wing conspiracy, or left wing conspiracy, I suppose, in the instance. Um, it’s not that aid, some aid programs don’t work, and have not been shown to work. The problem, I think, and the reason that I, again, invite you to at least think hard about supporting this resolution, is that the whole discussion of AIDS avoids, makes a kind of moral and historical end run around the problem of politics. It becomes, if you like, a kind of technical question. There are these suffering people, as Mr. Rosenkranz and Mr. Lehrer both described to you. We do or we don’t have the modalities to efficiently succor them. That is the aid narrative, if you will. And that is a narrative that, largely speaking, deprives the recipients of aid of their agency, infantilizes them, and also make sour aid a super-political, extrapolitical, moral question. It becomes a moral imperative, therefore we can't talk about the politics, we can't talk about whether the UN system actually works, which in my view, palpably, it doesn’t. Um, that’s another, perhaps another debate, about which I would be more categorical. Um, it is, it doesn’t, but it most of all doesn’t reckon with the fundamental question that people are not saved from outside, people rescue themselves, fundamentally. They can be helped, there’s nothing wrong with aid at the margins. If aid were less ambitious, if aid has less of a kind of globalizing, dare I say it, totalitarian program, I would support it, as I support emergency relief, which at least in my understanding of emergency relief, is not long term development, but rapid entry and departure in major, usually war or refugee movement emergencies. The words are unsatisfactory, but that’s more or less what it is. I don’t, I, I’ve worked in that field, and I do not think there is anything wrong with it. On the contrary, I think if done properly, if it doesn’t become a stalking horse for some ideological position, say liberal human rights, which I would insist is not simply the way the world is at its just, at its most just, but an ideological position. That you, if it does what it’s meant to do, which is, as I wrote in a book on this subject, offer a bed for a night, but not hope to save people, to transform society, et cetera, then I think that, the value of that aid, assuming it’s honestly given, and competently given, is indisputable. What is not indisputable by any stretch of the imagination is the idea that foreign institutions and governments and inter-governmental organizations, notably the European Union and the UN system know how to fix other people’s difficulties. The problem with aid, in short, is that it sets itself up as the kind of know all and end all. Now of course aid people will tell you this is no, not the case anymore, that was true in the bad old days of Lou Preston and the World Bank, it was true when all aid workers were, in Africa were, were white, it was true when, if you like, the aid system was kind of a direct follow on both of religious proselytizing, missionary impulse, and uh, colonialism. But the truth of the matter is that that old Texas adage, the man with the gold makes the rules, becomes, that definition of the golden rule, I mean, is as true today as it was when the French flag waved over. And I don’t think it can ever be different. So that what you have with aid by definition is outsiders telling people in a place how to do it, and telling them if they don’t behave satisfactorily, that is the best practices that you now see in humanitarianism, if you're not democratic, if you are not transparent, fi you don’t do this, that, or the other thing, then we will withdraw the aid. Well, if ever there was an example of any unequal form of relations, I would submit to you that that’s it, which is why, precisely, in depriving people of their agency, aid does more harm than good. It does some good, I, again, I insist on the point that there is middle ground here, but it does more harm than good. Moreover, it does seem to me that the emphasis on aid is misplaced, and that if you want to talk about what can be done in a place like Africa, but not only in Africa, I mean, after all there are other parts of the world that are unfavored in this moment in history for many of the same reasons, you might talk about fair trade a lot more than talking about development aid. Thank you."

    "data":"Uh, good evening everybody, and David, you were supposed to say all aid is bad and should be ended forever to make my life much easier. Um… Thank you for inviting us here this evening, and I want to strongly oppose the motion for a number of reasons I’ll share with you. First I think it oversimplifies an issue that warrants our attention and our engagement over and above our opinions for the simple reason that a lot of lives are at stake, and more importantly, dignity is at stake. And I think the motion conflates aid and policy, aid and politics, while overlooking, in fact, how complex aid is. Aid is provided by governments, in the case of our own government, we have twenty different pools of assistance provided by different agencies, some of them more effective than others. It’s provided by philanthropists, including African philanthropists in Africa. And it is provided by NGO’s. it’s a very complex instrument, and to lump it all together, I think, is to obviate the, obviate the good it can do. Third, and I think very obvious, it implies that therefore we should stop it. Um, and I think that this would be a, a cataclysmic mistake for reasons I will get to. Importantly, it overlooks the many successes, and you’ll hear more about this tonight, but particularly in health and education, and also in areas of economic transformation. Let me give you three examples. Ethiopia today has the first ever commodity exchange. This is critically important for farmers to be able to determine what prices they can get, and for trade to, to speed up within Ethiopia itself and within the region. It’s a great thing that can transform agriculture in that country. In part it was initially funded by aid. Let me give you a second, wireless access in Africa has had a huge impact, it’s allowing farmers in rural areas to call and see what prices are being tomatoes in the market, and cut out the middleman that might undercut them and reduce the number of dollars they get. That wireless transformation has come in part from the private sector, in part from local governments, and in part from aid. Third, microfinance, something we hear an increasing amount about, as transformative in the immediate lives of their families and communities. A lot of that money is generated from microfinanced funds themselves but a lot of that has also come from aid. I think that it’s a very out-of-date debate, it kind of overlooks the many things that are going on now about aid that I think will change it, for example today, the majority of country directors for American NGO’s in Africa are Africans. That wasn’t true 10 days ago, that has an enormous…impact. The new awareness about aid among Americans, about a civil society in Africa, is forcing a new transparency which is critical, to hold aid providers and aid recipients to account. Dictators were many times supported in the past and—and I wish I could say they would never be supported again, uh, we can talk about the elections later but for now, I think we’ve seen an important transformation, consider Zimbabwe. Where Robert Mugabe I believe is trying to run the country into the ground. The bulk of foreign aid to Zimbabwe now is going to civil-society institutions, that are trying and doing a very good job of protecting the institutions that can serve that country well, in the future. It also obviates and overlooks an important debate that’s going on now that I think is, is critical for our future, and gets to a point David made about aid and politics, there’s no question that politics has affected aid and aid has often been driven by politics. The emerging debate now among policy-makers, among NGO’s, among Africans, uh, among many, is that foreign aid in the case of the United States needs to be elevated, number one, so that it is on par with some of our other foreign-policy institutions. But more importantly, protected, from the politics that would drive it in the wrong direction. That in other words we need to learn how and move towards ringfencing development assistance, so that it can’t be used…for reasons other than development. I think to, to sug—to vote for a motion that said aid—aid is doing more harm than good, uh, undercuts that very important debate. The last point I would make is that I—I think the reason this, this motion is flawed is because at the end of the day development matters. And at the end of the day, the United States as a government, citizens of the United States, private companies in the United States, philanthropists in the United States, as around the rest of the world, I believe, have a responsibility and an interest in promoting development. I think it is a moral interest, it’s an economic interest, I think it’s a security interest, I think it has everything to do as well with our leadership. So I would also say in conclusion, that if we conclude that aid is doing more harm than good, and therefore we should get rid of it, what’s our alternative. Will we use the military as our primary means of doing our bit to contribute to Africa’s development in the future? I hope you will agree with me that that would not be the right way to go. Thank you."

    "data":"Good evening. I wanna talk to you about two tragedies that have…are covered by this debate. The first tragedy we’ve already heard about, that there’s a lot of unnecessary human suffering in Africa. That for example, children’s lives could be saved for a 12- cent dose of anti-malaria medication, could save them from dying from malaria. And that is in—indeed a tragedy that children are dying for lack of a 12-cent medicine. Everyone here on the panels agrees that’s a tragedy and feels compassion at this enormous tragedy. There’s also a second tragedy and that’s— this is a tragedy that we hear a lot less about. And this is the tragedy that we’ve already spent as official donors $600 billion in aid to Africa over the past 45 years, and after all that children are still not getting the 12-cent medicines. So there were still between one and three million deaths from malaria last year. So aid would be a great thing if it worked. But the sad tragedy is that—and this is really one of the, the scandals of our generation is that mo—money meant for the most desperate people in the world, is simply not reaching them. $600 billion in aid to Africa over the past 45 years, and over that ti—over that time period there’s basically been zero rise in living standards. Zero rise in incomes in Africa. The money is simply not reaching the people for whom it is intended. And yet, the advocates of aid always focus their energies simply talking about this number, about how much we spend in aid, as if that in itself were an achievement of some kind. This goes back, it—every generation calls for an increase in aid to try to resolve the problem of development. It goes back to an advisor to John F. Kennedy named Walt Rostow who called for doubling foreign aid way back in 1960. In 1973 World Bank president McNamara once again called for doubling of foreign aid. Actually this is something that I noticed in my research which, uh, as a professor you’re always kinda proud when you discover an empirical irregularity that really fits the data perfectly. And that is that when people call for an increase in aid they always call for exactly double. It’s always exactly 100 percent increase. Never, you know, 117 percent or 83—it—it’s amazing. So this has continued to the present, the 2005 G-8 summit called for doubling aid to Africa. Barack Obama’s called for doubling aid to Africa, Jeffrey Sachs has called for doubling aid to Africa. Uh, even our President George W. Bush called for and has already implemented an—an increase in US aid of 50 percent. I did worry for a moment that that didn’t fit my law, but, uh, I checked with the White House staff and they explained to me that he thought 50 percent was double. So… So what—what—what good does it do to focus on the amount spent, uh, this obsession with the amount spent on aid, if the balance of the evidence suggests that the, the money is not reaching the poor--sure, there is the occasional success, which we will hear about from time to time tonight, but the balance of the evidence is simply that, $600 billion went into Africa and income did not rise. So where did the money go? Well, unfortunately a lot of it went to corrupt rulers, to corrupt and autocratic rulers. Today, despite all the talk of action against corruption, two-thirds of all aid today goes to rulers who have the worst rating on corruption. Two-thirds of aid going to corrupt rulers. This is actually getting worse over time. There’s no evidence of any sort of post-Cold War break, in which, you know, in the bad old days aid when to corrupt dictators and now it goes to good guys. And by the way, uh, Gayle, Ethiopia is a good example, the, the ruler of Ethiopia is a guy named Meles who is a dictator who shot down unarmed demonstrators in the street, this is a guy who has been a darling of the aid community. This is not the kind of aid that accomplishes good, this is the kind of aid that does more harm than good. And in fact, aid has gone into states that subsequently collapsed into warlord anarchy. There was a lot of aid that went into Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, even up to the moment when the genocide broke out in Rwanda, there was still aid money going into Rwanda, in fact even after the genocide broke out the French were still supplying the Rwandan government, committing the genocide with aid dollars. Some of it military aid, obscenely enough. And so I say to you that aid, uh, and this is borne out by his—by statistical evidence, that aid worsens corruption, aid blocks democracy, aid is an obstacle to the freeing of Africans from predatory rulers… And I think we have no choice but to, to vote for the motion tonight, we, we cannot be satisfied with this record of aid, that has promised so much and accomplished so little. We must condemn the sorry record of aid for the sake of Africa, and for ourselves. It’s simply unacceptable that a system which is supposed to have the best intentions, is simply making things worse rather than better."

    "data":"Thank you, and thank you to everyone for joining tonight and, uh, thanks to members on all sides of the panel. I think it’s important to go back to the point that David Rieff made of understanding, even he of course supported rejecting the motion, ‘cause it’s so strong, and, uh, ambiguous as to what it even means. If we think about what aid actually achieves, and what it doesn’t achieve, we have to make sure we avoid the, uh, spurious correlations that have been mentioned tonight, just because two things happened at the same time doesn’t mean one is responsible of course for the other. But we also have to think about the framing of this statement, which is about the present tense, not the past. We’re not here to discuss and debate President Mobutu tonight. We’re here to talk about whether aid is doing more harm than good. And on that, there are four basic points I think we need to keep in mind. The first, is that it’s often understood or misunderstood, that bad governments and corruption are responsible for Africa’s poverty, and singularly responsible. Professor Ayittey often refers to the cheetahs of the new generation and the hippos of the last generation. Well, what about the cheetahs of the new development generation, the cheetahs of the new aid generation that are re—producing remarkable results across the board. When we actually look at the statistical evidence, as Professor Easterly does and I do and others, we see that, even when we compare governments with equal levels of good governance, we see that Africa on average grows about 2 percent per year slower than other developing countries around the world. Why is that? Why is it that, countries like Ghana and Senegal have better transparency international ratings than China and India, while it still grows so slowly while China and India take off? Why is it that Vietnam grows so quickly, while it has governance ratings so far below Tanzania, or Burkina Faso? It’s because of the issues of disease, it’s the lack of infrastructure, it’s the lack of education, it’s the terrible legacy of colonialism. But it’s about much, much more than bad governments. There’s no question that a bad government can drive a country off a cliff, but aid is about tackling those very practical challenges of health, education and infrastructure, if it’s to be done properly. Now, Professor Easterly discussed the $600 billion of aid to Africa. That’s the second myth is that this is vast sums down the drain. How much is $600 billion if we think about it per African, per year. If you divide that over all the years over all the Africans, by my estimate it’s maybe $28 per African per year. That’s all the money going down the drain. And then, there’s the third issue, well what we do we get for it, we’ve heard that nothing, nothing has been achieved. Well let’s talk about some of those successes. There’s the smallpox eradication that happened around the world, of course, thanks to, I have to say the UN’s World Health Organization that set up the target, set up a Smallpox Eradication Unit, and got rid of the disease. There’s the fight against AIDS. In 2002 we had perhaps 50,000 people on antiretroviral treatment in Africa. Thanks to the creation of the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria, and the US President’s Emergency Program for AIDS Relief, we now have well over a million people on anti-retroviral treatment within just five years. And for those of us who were in the trenches five, seven years ago, this was considered impossible. Impossible. We have throughout Africa primary enrollment rates since 1991 alone up 20 percentage points. Just last week we had the news that UNICEF, the Red Cross and others had cut measles death in Africa by 91 percent, between 2000 and 2006, from nearly 400,000 people a year, children, to 40,000 a year. They actually set a target to do that by 2010 and they were four years ahead of schedule. Of the 20,000 deaths a day, that our moderator pointed out at the beginning, those 360,000 are 1,000 a day of the to—the total. That was aid backing it. That was UNICEF, that was WHO, that was the American Red Cross, that was the Center for Disease Control working governments and the government national plans, and they got the job done. In Malawi, many of you might have seen the New York Times frontpage story on the weekend, where aid supported the national government to implement the plan that it wanted to implement, to get fertilizer and seeds to farmers, and in just two years, we saw a full country, one of the poorest countries on the planet, with a better governance rating than many countries growing much faster than it, double its food production, from one ton per hectare, to two tons per hectare, and it’s now actually an aid donor in the region. So we have to reject these myths, we also need to reject the one about trade, the fourth one, that it’s trade, not aid. We all want trade, we all want aid, and we all want market development, and we wanna focus on the practical things that can be done to reduce poverty and to support the countries to reduce poverties on their own terms. So let me just conclude by saying first, just screaming governance and corruption is simply not the case. It’s too simplistic and it ob—obscures the underlying truth of disease, lack of infrastructure, lack of education in Africa. Second, the scary big numbers that we often hear, are often quite tiny, in fact minuscule, when we think of them in terms of the real people in Africa, and what they’re trying to achieve. Third, we see amazing successes each and every day, such as the eradication of measles, when practical strategies are set to achieve practical targets, no politics, just getting the job done. So it’s with these three points in mind that I urge the house to reject the simplistic and misleading proposition that aid to Africa does more harm than good, and more importantly, let’s join together to focus on the practical task of ensuring that aid builds on the successes, to keep doing as much good as it possibly can. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you very much. Appreciate that nice introduction. Somewhat accurate, somewhat inaccurate. It’s always great to be back in my hometown, New York City. I don’t need much excuse to come here, I love this place. Even though I spent most of my adult life in other places. But it always has been home, even though I don’t live here, I live in Washington, D.C. I come here for the Metropolitan Opera and my beloved Yankees. I know I’ve probably alienated half the audience now, I’m not supposed to do that. But I’m delighted to be here and obviously this is an important subject and one that Fred and I have been very much involved in for a couple years. My involvement in Iraq goes back to 2003 when I was on active duty and, I visited Iraq right after the invasion, and shortly left active duty. I joined Secretary Rumsfeld’s policy board at his request with Henry Kissinger and Newt Gingrich and Tom Foley and Freddy Clay, a bunch of others. And Iraq became an increasingly more important subject for us, as the war unfolded before our eyes and the challenges that we were facing. In 2006, I parted company with the administration and the Pentagon over the war in Iraq, because I thought—I believed our strategy was failing. I took that message to Secretary Rumsfeld, and also the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Peter Pace, and had devised a new strategy to help promulgate that. While I was in the throes of developing that strategy I met Fred Kagan, over at the American Enterprise Institute, and he put together a planning group that was looking at the war and a new strategy, and we found that, our ideas were exactly the same. And eventually, with others, and I may say others, that had some influence on the President of the United States to admit, that the strategy was failing, and it needed to be changed. I tell you that because, I knew what failure looked like. And I think so did you. And I also know what the word “winning,” or “success” looks like in Iraq, it’s been a stunning achievement in Iraq, somewhat unprecedented in the history of counterinsurgency warfare, for such a dramatic turnaround in such a short period of time. And that stunning achievement that…you are generally familiar with it. But it’s based certainly on a new strategy, but it’s also based on the premise that security was a necessary precondition for political and economic progress. We had never had that, as a staple, before we tried to do it complementary among those three issues, and that blew up and failed. That’s the reality of it. So we had to get security if we were gonna make political progress and that is a stunning achievement, in such a short period of time. Zero ethno-sectarian violence. All of the violence dramatically down 60 to 80 percent depending on the category, I won’t go into the details of all of that, some of you are familiar with it but it’s quite remarkable. Most of the time, we go to Iraq every few months, about every three months for two weeks at a time, we spend most of our time with the Iraqi people. Out on the streets where they are, in the schools, in their hospitals, seeing what life was like, in 2006, no children going to schools, hundreds of people being killed every week, people not going to their jobs, only going to marketplaces to seek provisions on an emergency basis. Terrorized and intimidated, a country fracturing, heading towards civil war, it was not a civil war, and a possibly failed state. The conditions in Iraq today and gradually improving over 2007 and 2008 are a dramatic difference. Schools, all schools, are open, in Iraq. Primary, secondary, and 27 colleges, universities and technical colleges that they, they have in Iraq. The marketplaces are teeming, there’s a social fabric in Iraq that’s taken place in the evening, or on the days off when people are visiting zoos and what’s left of museums and, the, the natural rhythm of life is returning to the people of Iraq. Iraq is all about its people, in my judgment, so that is why we spend so much time understanding what happened to them, and what is now happening to them. And it’s fascinating to see. The security situation dramatically improved because the mainstream Sunni insurgents who started the war have capitulated. They have surrendered. They are coming into the political process, to achieve their political objectives. And that is a dramatic turnaround and that’s how insurgency—either insurgencies end when they walk away and leave the field of battle or they come into the political process. The al-Qaeda have been operationally defeated. They no longer threaten the legitimacy of the regime. They cannot mount a sustained campaign to do that. They don’t have the infrastructure or the networks to do it. Shia extremism, has had a major setback supported by the Iranians, and as time appears to be playing out for us, it appears that it’s going to be a major defeat as well. The impact on the political process, is extraordinary, there’s a rising political class in Iraq, that we have seen. Every place you go in Iraq, people are interested in the political process. Participating in it, there are 500-plus parties in Iraq. I mean, we struggle with these two that we have. To say the least. Can you imagine what it’s like. The youth in Iraq, and we’ve attended some of their party meetings, it’s wonderful to see their energy and their motivation and to participate in something that’s all new to them. A fledgling democracy. It’s fascinating to see this taking hold in Iraq. The national legislative benchmarks, 18 of them have been… Only one out of the 18 has not succeeded, and that is really, quite dramatic. The political reconciliation that has taken place in Iraq is very real, the most recent one is the Provincial Election Law, which will redefine Iraq, it is a seminal event. Power will be shared, and diffused in the provinces, the people will get better services as a result of it, they will have their own budgets, they will have a place to go to express their grievances and their needs. Iraq will never be the same again as a result of what is gonna take place in January of this year. Less than three years after this government, as inefficient as it has been at times and ineffective as it has been at times, when you draw back from it, it has been a remarkable movement towards what the premise is here. Success in Iraq, success in Iraq for them, and success in Iraq for us."

    "data":"Thank you very much, I made this film actually, largely because of my heritage as a policy wonk, before I made money, I got a doctorate in political science at MIT, my thesis advisor, Carl Kazin, had been Deputy National Security Advisor for President Kennedy. And he endeavored to teach me to think rigorously about these matters and I will leave it to you to see whether he succeeded to any measure. He also had a wicked sense of humor which I will feebly attempt to imitate. If the entire cast of Saturday Night Live” had somehow gotten together with the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, and Charlie Chaplin, and they had tried, in their wildest dreams, to think up a catastrophe of a war, they could not possibly have become remotely close, to what the Bush administration did in Iraq. And, I will endeavor to demonstrate that, in the remaining time of my remarks, damage on that scale is not repaired with a surge, it is not repaired over a short time, this is something that that nation and the United States and the world are going to be recovering from for decades. And, if you think that we’re winning the war in Iraq in any meaningful sense now, then, I invite you to wait a few weeks when the Dow is down to about 2000, and Henry Paulsen stands on the rubble of the American financial system and declares victory when the bleeding has stopped. That would be a roughly comparable—and I’m sure that will happen soon—that would be a roughly comparable kind of event. Why was this war fought in the view of those who decided to fight it? I was an ambivalently, complicatedly, slightly favorable towards the war kind of person, or towards the idea of deposing Saddam. It was fought to remove the threat of WMD from Iraq, and also from the region. To install a pro-Western democratic government, to bring peace and freedom and liberty and security to the population of Iraq and also to spread that to the entire Middle East. It was also intended to assist the United States in bringing economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Iraq so that it would stop developing nuclear weapons. The administration predicted, and, sometimes said this publicly, believed it internally, widely known, widely quoted, that the costs of the war might reach $50 billion. And that US forces would probably be substantially withdrawn by September of 2003. So, what happened. Not enough troops were used. Planning for the war began 60 days before the invasion, planning for—excuse me, planning for the occupation, began 60 days before the invasion. It was vastly inadequate. Looting destroyed the entire country, most of its infrastructure, 16 of 20 ministries, most important infrastructural objects, power plants, et cetera, were destroyed by the looting. The looting went completely unchecked by US forces. Ambassador Bremer when appointed, before he had set foot in Iraq for the first time in his life, a man who had never served in the military, never overseen an occupation of any kind, on May 9th, 2003, he decided that he was going to issue a de- Baathification order, which lopped off and purged for life the top 50,000 administrators and technocrats in Iraq. He then disbanded the Iraqi military, throwing half a million soldiers onto the street, unemployed, with no notice. Who promptly formed the insurgency. Virtually nothing was done about the insurgency, for quite a long time its existence was denied. Economic policy was placed in the hands of politically appointed ideologues. And what did we see as a result. 4,000 Americans dead so far, a trillion and a half dollars spent, 100,000 Americans wounded, twice the official number. The official number is a vast underestimate. And an Iraq that is just destroyed. Of Iraq’s 34,000 physicians, 2,000 were assassinated, 20,000 left. 25 percent of the population of Iraq is either dead, or is displaced internally, or is external refugees, the equivalent of 60 million people in the United States having left the country. At the peak of the violence, several hundred people per day in Iraq, were being kidnapped or killed. Okay, so, but what of Iraq now, I hear you say. Has this country become a paradise. No it has not. Violence is down. It’s down roughly 75 percent, we don’t know exactly how much. To some degree a sense of normalcy is returning to the country. People are haltingly able to go to school, to go to work now in ways that they previously were not. But, the infrastructure of the country remains destroyed, by most indicators, it remains below pre-war levels, in matters such as water supply, sewage treatment, electricity, power generation. The country is enormously traumatized, it went from being 55 or 60 percent Shia to now, probably 80 percent Shia because the refugees are overwhelmingly Sunni. And a population and a government increasingly dominated, already thoroughly dominated by rather extremist, fundamentalist Islamic parties and beliefs. It’s difficult to believe, but Iraq still with the violence down 75 percent, Iraq is still a more dangerous place and a more hostile place, and a worse place, for most people, than it was under Saddam Hussein. That is difficult to achieve. But we managed. In addition, we have enormously strengthened Iran, which is continuing to develop nuclear weapons, unchecked by the United States. The American military is debilitated and tied down in this country, unable to do anything about the rapidly worsening situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The military is exhausted. And, as far as I know, those 4,000 Americans are still dead, those half-million Iraqis are still dead, and the situation remains, I fear, irretrievable. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you very much, it’s an honor to be here, it’s an honor to be talking about this extremely important topic. I might object to, excessive levity and discussions of Marx Brothers and so forth, in regard to a war that has cost the lives of many thousands of people, I actually think this issue’s a little more serious than that frankly. Without meaning to spend my time taking on directly the comments that were just made I’m going to mention a couple of errors of fact. Electricity production is higher than pre-war levels in Iraq, that is a fact. The country is not 80 percent Shia, although I’m sure that some of the Shia parties would like to believe that. But it absolutely is not. And is life worse than under Saddam, well, that depends on who you are. And, this has definitely been a traumatic, miserable experience for the Iraqi people. I am in full agreement with the assertion that the Bush administration planned for the war badly, conducted the war badly, lived in denial for years. I was on record for all of that time, criticizing the strategy that was being pursued, criticizing the administration…I get it. It’s also irrelevant, to the point at hand. And it’s unfortunate in our national discourse, that we spend so much of our time refighting the issue of whether or not this was a good idea, and not enough time talking about where we are, where we’re headed, what our interests are, and whether we are likely to be able to achieve them. Which is from the standpoint of a decision-maker, the only thing that matters. And particularly since, President Bush, will not be running for office again, the question of his wisdom or un-wisdom in ordering this war, is something that can be safely left to the historians at this point. So, the question is where are we now, and the question the motion has put is, are we winning the war. I would like to amend the motion to say, America and the Iraqis Are Now Finally Winning.” Because one of the things that has gone unnoticed, is that, a tremendous portion of the fighting that was done over the past 18 months was done by Iraqis. Including the 100,000 Iraqi security forces that came on line, in a year, trained in contact with the enemy, marched directly into the fight against the enemy, both Sunni and Shia, and defeated the enemy across the board with American assistance of course. It was a remarkable thing. One of the most remarkable instances of this, was when Prime Minister al-Maliki ordered the Iraqi security forces to clear the city of Basra, which was under the control of enemy groups of one sort and another. And, the initial operation was a disaster. We worked hard to help him fix it, he worked hard to fix it, and one of the things that he did to fix it, was to order the quick reaction force of the First Iraqi Army Division, to reinforce. That division is based in Anbar. It is a heavily Sunni division. It marched into Basra, where there are virtually no Sunni, and immediately began fighting against local militias and criminals. There were no instances of sectarianism, either by that formation or against that formation. It was accepted, as the legitimate military force of the government of Iraq, acting against criminals and enemies of Iraq. As an instance of reconciliation, and what this government means to Iraqis now, there are few cases that could be more poignant than that. That formation remained in the south, it continued to fight right up to the Iranian border…which also sent a message to Iran by the way. And as we talk about how Iran has been strengthened by this war, we need to talk about how Iran has been dealt a tremendous defeat, by the destruction of its key proxy in Iraq, Muqtada al-Sadr’s Jaysh al-Mahdi, which organization was militarily defeated, and has now largely disbanded politically as well. Muqtada himself is in disgrace, and the Iranians are scrambling, and hoping, that we will take council of our despair and leave Iraq to its fate. The question will be put…was this war worth it. I would submit, that that’s a slightly different question from whether we are winning or not and we can parse the semantics of this any way you like. As a military analyst which is all that I am, I can tell you, the trend lines now, are positive. The importance of the elections law that was just passed, passed most Americans by. It is a watershed event. And I can tell that, because I’ve had in the past few weeks, conversations with senior politicians, senior Iraqi military leaders, I’m sorry, senior Iraqi politicians, Sunni and Shia, and before that law was passed, they were very grim, and very gloomy, and so was I. After that law was passed, the nature of the conversations that I had with these gentlemen, changed entirely. And instead of the gloom and doom, we had, almost wistful conversations about, how Iraq will form itself into a country. How the Sunni and Shia will work together, what the relationship between Arabs and Kurds will be, and they also all made to me an interesting point. They said, you know, Iraq will be a rival to Saudi Arabia. A rival in oil, and also, a threat to Saudi Arabia because Iraq will be a democracy. And Iraq will pose a challenge to authoritarian regimes around the region, and Iraq will be aligned with the United States. They were telling me that. Now I believe that that’s true, and I believe that it is attainable, and I think that the evidence shows that, and I think that, if we are in fact headed in that direction and we can in fact make that happen, then, this war will have been worth fighting. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you very much indeed for your warm welcome. Lyndon Johnson once said that was the sort of introduction which my father would’ve enjoyed and my mother would’ve believed. I’m conscious that I’m the fourth person to speak this evening so I will say what King Henry XIII of England is reputed to have said to each of his six wives. Please don’t worry, I don’t intend to keep you long.” I was at first concerned when I was asked to take part in this debate, whether, as a British politician, I should be speaking in a debate about the United States. But I reflected that George W. Bush’s closest ally in the decision to go to war, was Tony Blair. British troops have been in Iraq over those five years, British soldiers have died, and Britain and the United States share a responsibility, along with other coalition countries, for what has happened. I don’t dispute for a moment that the surge to which reference has been made this evening, has been successful in military terms, in reducing the amount of violence. I don’t doubt that the insurgency itself, may be slowly coming to an end, and that fewer people are being killed on the streets of Baghdad, than was the case in the past. But of course that is true of all wars, all wars gradually grind to an end, in one form or another. But that is not the same as saying, that you have won that war. Because to say that you have won or are winning the war, you have to answer two questions. First of all, are we going to achieve the reasons why we went to war in the first place, either in whole or in part, and even if we were, does the price that has been paid, by the people of Iraq and by the West as a whole, make that sacrifice having been worth being made. Now when you look at what the plus side is, and there’s one factor that also has to be mentioned at this moment. This is not a war like Pearl Harbor. Or like the war in Afghanistan after 9-11, or the first Gulf War to liberate Kuwait. You are wrong, General Keane, to say that Sunni insurgents started this war, they didn’t. The United States, the United Kingdom and the coalition started this war, and they had not been attacked when they chose to do so. So what has been achieved. Let us be generous and acknowledge, certain things have been achieved. Saddam Hussein is gone and there isn’t a person who will be other than pleased to see him go. But you know, we’d like to see Mugabe go without going to war in Zimbabwe, we’d like to see Kim Jong-il in North Korea go. We’d have liked to have seen Fidel Castro go. These are not justifications for a war. And yes it’s true, Iraq may have a more representative government than it’s had for many years. But it’s not a democratic government, it’s a sectarian government of finely balanced Shia and Sunni, who when they’ve not been slaughtering each other in the last five years, have formed a very, very uneasy coalition. And yes, fewer people are being killed. But by God, you know, that can rise again, at any moment, for all we know. When you look at the price that has been paid and continues to be paid, that cannot simply be put on one side, as simply history, as Mr. Kagan implied. We know that first of all that the weapons of mass destruction which were the main reason for going to war, never existed. We know that by the admission of President Bush, at least 30,000 Iraqis have lost their lives, and indeed the Iraqi government say over 100,000 Iraqis have lost their lives in the last five years. We know that four million Iraqis have become refugees, half of them fleeing to other countries. 40 percent of the Iraqi middle class, no longer live in Iraq, and as a consequence, the job of rebuilding Iraq is going to be immeasurably more difficult. And we know also that the coalition forces, mainly American, have lost over 4,000 lives. These are a heavy burden. But it’s not just the internal cost that is being paid, look at what has happened in terms of the wider situation. We know for example that the consequence of this war is that Iran…the most dangerous country in the region, has, thanks to the United States and the coalition, now become the most powerful country in the Gulf. The Iranians cannot believe their luck. Without raising a finger, Iraq which was the state that was their main competitor in the Gulf, has been essentially emasculated, for the foreseeable future. We know that al-Qaeda, who were never allowed to operate in Iraq under Saddam Hussein, have been active, have penetrated Iraq and even if they are ultimately defeated, have already radicalized sections of the community and done enormous harm. We know that the new Iraqi government is not going to be any more pro-Israeli, than any other Arab state, why should they be, they are an Arab government, they will share the view of the Arab world. And we know also, that the United States in particular, has lost at this vital time its moral leadership of the world, because of having initiated this terrible conflict. But perhaps the most serious geopolitical problem, that has flown from this ill-judged initiative and invasion, has been that the real drama of the present time in that region, is Iran’s attempts to develop nuclear weapons. And we know that as a consequence of the loss of authority, of the loss of leadership, that the United States in particular has experienced as a result of the Iraq war, the United States has found it incredibly more difficult to get agreement either in the Security Council or in the international community, to take the kind of steps against Iran, that would be necessary in order to encourage it to desist from its nuclear ambitions. So when you talk about winning the war,” it’s not possible as General Keane implied, to simply think of that in purely military terms. One has to look at the overall cost, and the overall benefits. And I conclude simply by saying this. At best you can say, we may be stopping losing the war, but we’re certainly not winning it. And I simply remind you of the words said almost 2,000 years ago, by Tacitus, a great Roman, when in comparable circumstances, he said, They have created a wilderness, and they call it peace.” That is our legacy."

    "data":"Thank you very much. And first I’d like to thank Bob and Alexandra and Dana for the terrific job they’ve done in turning this debate series into reality. And I’d like to thank all of you for showing up on such a miserable evening to hear a debate about what I do think is one of the most important issues that we could possibly talk about. No doubt many of you are asking yourselves tonight, why should America take on the thankless task of policing the globe. To answer that question, start by asking, does the world need a policeman. That’s like asking whether New York City needs a police force. As long as evil exists, someone will have to protect peaceful people from predators. The international system is no different in this regard from your own neighborhood, except that predators abroad are far more dangerous than ordinary robbers, rapists and murderers. They are, if given half a chance, mass robbers, mass rapists, mass murderers. Without an effective police force the world community would fall apart faster, and more completely than New York City did in the 1970s. There are to be sure lots of international laws on the books prohibiting genocide, landmines, biological weapons and other nasty things. But without enforcement mechanisms they are as worthless as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which outlawed war as an instrument of national policy, 11 years before the Vermacht rolled into Poland. The hope of idealistic liberals for more than a century has been that some international organization would punish the wicked. But the League of Nations was a dismal failure, and the UN is not much better. The best multilateral alternative is probably NATO. But from Bosnia to Afghanistan we have seen time and again that NATO has trouble acting effectively. In fact five retired NATO generals have just issued a report that bemoans the absence of a properly defined political objective, the absence of an integrated strategy to achieve that objective, and the absence of capabilities to implement the strategy. Now that doesn’t mean we should abandon NATO. It does mean we should have no illusions that its European members can fend for themselves. So who does that leave to be the world’s policeman. Belgium, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Bangladesh? I think the answer’s pretty obvious. It’s the country with the most vibrant economy, the most fervent devotion to liberty, and the most powerful military. In the 19th century, Great Britain battled enemies of all mankind such as slave traders and pirates, preserved the balance of power on the continent, and kept the world’s seas open to commerce. Today the only nation that can play an equivalent role is the United States of America. Allies will be needed, but America is, as Madeline Albright said, the indispensable nation. Now skeptics will reply that America has an isolationist past, and no desire to past globo-cop. But rumors of American isolationism are greatly exaggerated. Since the earliest days of the republic American traders, missionaries and soldiers have penetrated the farthest corners of the world, and they have a long history of upholding civilized norms. I am reminded in fact of the words spoken 104 years ago, by a great New Yorker. He said, Chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation. And in the Western Hemisphere, the adherence of the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power.” Now when Teddy Roosevelt spoke those words, the Western Hemisphere was the only place where the US exercised military hegemony. Today America exercises almost as much power everywhere around the world, as we once had only the Caribbean. In fact we have more power than any other state in history. Thus, by Roosevelt’s logic the US is obligated to defend civilization, and that is precisely what we are doing. That is why American troops have fought in places like Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq to up—restore the rule of law and uphold human rights. That is why American troops are still stationed from South Korea to Germany, to prevent aggression and a return of dangerous rivalries. That is why the US Navy patrols the world’s oceans, to prevent the closing of checkpoints at— chokepoints, such as the Straits of Hormuz. And that’s why numerous agencies of the US government work to combat terrorism, and to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction. That is what being the world’s policeman is all about. Of course we cannot right every wrong, nor intervene everywhere. We have to use prudence and judgment in the exercise of our power, something we have not always done in recent years. But America’s occasional missteps should not lead us to abdicate our indispensable role, any more than the NYPD should stop doing its vital work, simply because cops occasionally do the wrong thing. On balance, the NYPD still does far more good than harm, and so does the United States of America. In fact America has been the greatest force for good in the world in the past century. Just think of what happened when we did not act as globo-cop. Think of what happened in 1914, in 1939. By contrast, think of what happened when we did act as globo-cop. Think of what happened in 1945, and 1989. American intervention made possible the defeat of Nazism, and Communism. American isolationism made possible the outbreak of two world wars. As these examples demonstrate, there is nothing altruistic about our globo-cop role. As the world’s most prosperous country, and as a country that depends for its prosperity on the free flow of people, capital and products, we are the biggest beneficiaries of the liberal international order that we safeguard. Compared with the benefits that we gain the financial costs are trivial. We currently spend 4% of our GPD on defense, a lot less than the average during the past four decades. That 4 cents on the dollar preserving international peace and stability is a bargain. Now I imagine that the other side will claim that our international policing function makes us hated, and leads to greater violence against us. That is sometimes the case and I will be the first to admit it. But we are as often reviled for not acting, for not stopping the genocide in Rwanda or Darfur, for not imposing peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. And yes, there is a cost to be paid for action, as we’ve learned in Iraq. But there is also a cost to be paid for inaction. During the 1990s we ignored our policing responsibilities in Afghanistan. As the civil war raged between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance, our leaders said in essence what Britain’s leaders said in the 1930s—that there is no reason to be concerned about a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing. Well on 9-11 we found out why we should care. The answer can be seen a few miles from here, where the World Trade Center once stood. 9-11 should’ve taught us that we cannot ignore potential peril, nor count on others to protect us. We must safeguard ourselves, and not simply by launching retaliatory strikes after thousands, perhaps millions have perished. We need to play a proactive role. We need to police areas of unrest, and to do what we can to bring decent government to war-torn lands. If we fail to act, we, as the mightiest nation in the world, will pay the heaviest price. I therefore urge you to heed Theodore Roosevelt’s admonition, and to vote in favor of America exercising an international police power. Thank you."

    "data":"Okay? Well, good evening, everyone, I’m not Ian Bremmer, I’m Ellen, and I rise to oppose the notion that the US should be the world’s policeman. The United States indisputably has a vital role to play in world affairs, we have unique qualities for leadership. At present, perhaps not as a permanent state of affairs, some of this unique role is circumstantial because our only peer adversary for over half a century is no more. Some of it is inherent in our qualities. The size of our country, the wealth that we enjoy, and the talent of our people. We can influence world affairs, both by conscious decisions that our governments make, by our society’s desire to respond to humanitarian disasters, and in positions that we take in multilateral negotiations and in regional organizations. Americans for the most part do want to be active on the world stage. But we can do good in the world, and we can benefit as a society, from active engagement in the world, without being the world’s policeman. Let’s talk some definitions. Now, I don’t know whether the organizers of this debate meant police” in a literal sense. But let’s take the word police” at three different levels. First would be police” as in a demand for someone to enforce the rules, not make the rules, but enforce them. So who do you—when you’re in trouble, call 911, the police come. So that’s the kind of bottom-level, literal definition of, of policeman in this case. We could also think of the world’s policeman as a metaphor for a security provider in much broader dimensions. Who sets the laws and enforces them. This would be a reference to the hegemonic stability system that we’ve known internationally since World War II, that would refer to for example America’s military presence in East Asia, or in the role that we played when we finally decided to topple the Taliban in Afghanistan. And then there’s a third definition that’s perhaps a little more abstract. Policeman” as a surrogate for any use of force, or for a monopoly on the use of force, including going to war, preemptive wars, preventive wars. We decided Saddam Hussein had to go, we made the rule for ourself [sic], it wasn’t a rule for anybody else, it was just for us. So that’s a third definition of the world’s policeman.” So I oppose this motion and I hope you will agree with me, for several reasons. First let’s take some practical reasons. The US is a country, not a global government. We have to know our limits. The United States should use force when it’s in our interest, just like every other country has to make existential decisions about the use of force and about war and peace. If we step up to the role of the world’s policeman we would be committing to act and to put our soldiers and police and our citizens in harm’s way where U.S. interests may be very modest. Do we want to assume responsibility to go anywhere anytime? A second practical argument is that we can’t do it. And here I mean both in terms of quantity and quality. Quantity: guess how many of the eleven thousand police who are currently deployed worldwide in U.N. operations are American? Out of eleven thousand, two hundred and ninety-one are U.S. policemen. And they are in Kosovo and Haiti, principally. So the U.S. has not provided robust manpower from our police forces. We’ve also learned that the way we train our policemen in a federal system is not all that well suited to the requirements for police in a lot of peace operations post-conflict. And then let’s ask literally, are we capable of doing the job? Can we be the beat cop that Max talked about? Do we know the neighborhood? Do we speak the language? Do we know the culture so that we can diffuse conflict before it breaks into violence? I’m not so sure about that. It turns out that a lot of other countries, by the way, are willing to train their citizens and deploy them to be policemen in such circumstances – the South Asians, the Australians, the Canadians and the Nordics, in particular. A third practical reason is that I’m not sure the American people want us to play this role alone. There is a deep belief that the security burdens in the world need to be shared and that not all security problems affect American interests. We need to make choices. Polls show that Americans want to respond when there are humanitarian requirements, et cetera, but they don’t want to do it alone. Now, I’m not going to make the cost argument because I actually don’t think it’s the most persuasive one. The U.S. does still contribute twenty-five percent of the U.N.’s costs to deploy forces around the world but we are behind in our dues. And before we criticize the U.N., I think we better decide whether the under-funding of some of the U.N.’s activities are, in fact, because we haven’t paid our, our fair share. Second set of arguments I want to make against this motion are political ones. And here basically it’s two arguments. One is an argument about today, the particular moment that we’re in. And another is an argument about the horizon, about the future. I think today we have a particular problem trying to assert that we could or should be the world’s policeman. We have over-used our global leadership role. We have abused, in a way, the, the good will of the international community by deciding that we knew better than anyone how to bring security to dangerous parts of the world. And it turned out we weren’t as good at it as we thought we would be. We have not necessarily made – at least the key, Iran and Afghan…Iraq and Afghanistan – more secure or more stable. This is not the moment to reassert the policeman’s role. A third set of arguments – at the horizon my argument is that there is a realignment of power in the 21st Century. Other countries are rising. This does not mean that the United States is in decline. It does not mean that we’re weak. But other countries are rising and it’s a good moment to try to reallocate some of the responsibilities for these activities. I have a third, a last argument, which is a philosophical one. I think it would behoove American society and the long term interests of the American people if we would take a more nuanced and egalitarian sense of our place in the world. In the age of globalization we’ve benefited at least as much as everybody else. But we have to be, we have to start to recognize that other people are good at this game too, and that we have to have more respect for the capacity of others to contribute to the global commons. So what I advocate is a multilateral approach to the security needs of the international community. I want an integrated approach that doesn’t look just at the security aspects of some of these problems but weaves together cultural, political and economic dimensions of policy responses. And I want us to care a lot more about the legitimacy of how we engage internationally, particularly since, as the world becomes more democratic –"

    "data":"Thank you. You will observe that some of the things that I have to say overlap some of the things that Max Boot said. This is so, I daresay, not only because great minds run in the same channel, but also because the things on which we agree are true. All societies, when they become sufficiently interdependent, need governance. The society of states, the society of sovereign countries has reached that point. The international society needs governance and the United States provides it. The United States provides to other countries some, although not all, of the services that governments provide within the countries that they govern. This, as it happens, is the thesis of my 2006 book, The Case for Goliath: How America Acts as the World’s Government in the 21st Century, that the organizers have very kindly provided outside this room. The United States provides order to the world, as governments must, in two ways. First, economic activity within countries requires a secure backdrop. Government protects commerce and enforces contracts. The United States does this in the global economy. American military deployments and the American alliance systems assure the free flow of trade and the movement of capital across borders. This economic activity known as globalization, and made possible by the American role as the world’s police force, has brought benefits to hundreds of millions of people. Second, the United States helps keep order in the world by leading the effort to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of groups or individuals that would deploy them in ways antithetical to the interests not only of the United States, but of the world in general. The United States leads the effort at global nuclear non-proliferation. And in these two ways above all, the United States acts as the world’s police force. Now, to this argument at least three objections may be made. And we’ve already heard one of them. One objection is that the United States does not carry out its policing duties as well as it should. As Ellen Laipson said, the United States is not present everywhere and doesn’t act perfectly. And this is certainly true, but neither does any police force. Every police force is subject to criticism, legitimate criticism. But criticizing a police force is not the same thing as arguing that there should not be one. A second objection to the motion is that it would be better if global policing were carried out, not by the United States, but by other countries or groups of countries or international organizations. Now, I daresay if the proposition were put that way to the American public a majority of them might agree. But it is the fact, as Max Boot noted, that there is no other country or group of countries that is willing or able to take up the burden of global policing. And as for international organizations, they are far too feeble to do so, and that emphatically includes the international organization to which some would like to assign the task of global policing – the one whose headquarters is located a few blocks from here – the United Nations. So the alternative to the United States as the world’s policeman is not a better international order. It is more international disorder. Well, a third objection is, what about Iraq? Well, the American military operations in Iraq really have two parts. The first part involved removing a tyrannical government and insuring that neither it nor a tyrannical successor would possess weapons of mass destruction. The second part of the operation involves trying to construct a stable, decent democratic government in that country. The first task which falls within the purview of global policing was successfully accomplished. The second has not been done so successfully. But the second task – what’s wrongly called nation building and should be called state building – is not an example of police work. It’s an example of social work. The United States is not good at social work but it doesn’t have to be to perform as the world’s police force. So to oppose this motion you must believe one or both of two things. You must believe either that the world does not need policing or that there is some better source of global policing than the United States. There is, I submit, no reason to believe either. And I will add, by way of conclusion, that there is one group of people with a keen interest in global order and extensive familiarity with the American role in the world that emphatically does not believe either proposition. I refer to the world’s governments. They could, if they chose, circumscribe or abolish altogether by banding together to oppose it, the American role as the world’s policeman. But they have done and shown no signs of doing any such thing. And the reason is that they understand and appreciate the benefits that America’s role as the global policeman confers upon their countries and on the world as a whole. So whatever the verdict of the people in this house, the governments of the world above all, by what they have not done, have voted in favor of this motion. Thank you."

    "data":"Ladies and gentlemen, I was touched by what Max Boot, Max Boot said about the excellence of the British empire and British imperialism in the 19th and early 20th Century. I'm old enough – he’s not – to remember that that was not the American attitude towards British imperialism, even in the 1950s and the 1960s. What happens when any one nation tries to assert, coercively, its predominance over the rest of the world is that other nations begin to gang up against them. And in that case the United States was part of the group that ganged up against the British empire. It might be fair, it might not be fair. But it will always happen and it’s something to which I want to return. But first – and if you’ll forgive me that spirit of malice which I find rescues these occasions from the horrors of constructive debate, may, may I, I say what a privilege it, it is to find ranged, against me three of the finest minds it’s possible to locate among protagonists for a doomed cause. One of my fellow countrymen, Douglas Murray’s precocious genius – well, few on the British, the thinking British right have not heard of Douglas Murray’s genius. I have to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that he has taken elements in Britain quite by storm. One commentator praises him as the right’s answer to Michael Moore, God help us. His unkinder critics have suggested – I, I think in jest -- that when younger he had a brief flirtation with the Baptist Church. Only on discovering that baptism by total immersion meant disappearing entirely from the public view for all of thirty seconds, made Mr. Murray relent. Max Boot appeared last year on a list of the Five Hundred Most Influential Foreign Policy Thinkers. We, on this side of the debate, do not dispute Mr. Boot’s influence on foreign policy thinking any more than we dispute the influence of Donald Rumsfeld or King George the III. Both Murray and Boot and Michael Mandelbaum, too clever for the mob on their own side, represent one of the most interesting political experiments in outsourcing ever conducted -- U.S. conservatism’s franchising out to experts of its higher mental faculties. Their function, they’re a kind of priesthood, is to flatter stupider people that there exist higher arguments, smarter than they themselves can quite grasp, for things that they wanted to do anyway. They should be here in white robes. Three fine fellows, then – one of them older, one of them younger, all of them prettier and all of them cleverer than the argument that they represent. We salute them. Next, to the, to the argument that they represent: why must Washington shun the mantle of world policeman? For three reasons: First, America can’t; Second, America shouldn’t; and Third, Americans won’t embrace this role. We don’t debate whether Belgium should police the world because the possibility does not arise nor does it for America, as Ellen Laipson says – not even America. She is more powerful than any but nowhere like more powerful than all of the nations of the world. The point at which the United States most closely approached political hegemony – military, political and economic was more than half a century ago. It was at the end of the Second World War. Since then, and despite magnificent growth in absolute terms, America has been in almost continuous relative decline. After the implosion of the Soviet Union the impression of power vacuum was just a mirage. It was not a vacuum. It was a fragmentation, as America and my own country, Britain, are discovering in Iraq and Afghanistan, where we are hopelessly entangled in two quite undeveloped countries, both of which I visited since the occupation. Where are the armies? Where are the fleets? Where are the treasure chests to finish this job, let alone embark on new coercions? If the predominance of America’s wealth and power in comparison with any single rival has misled some into supposing that America could out-punch all of them together, it never misled cleverer men like Messrs. Boot, Mandelbaum and Murray. They have advanced a more subtle theory that if America picked on a single miscreant nation and sorted it out by force, then mission accomplished – others would learn the lesson. It’s an attractive idea. It didn’t work – quite the reverse. It triggered an international up-swelling of resentment and resistance. This has weakened America’s greatest resource – good will, her powers of persuasion. Maybe you think the world is judging America unfairly. I, I think the world judged imperial Britain unfairly. But ask why that happens, why that always happen. And if you want to know the answer, ask how Americans would feel if the boot – Max will forgive me – were not on the American foot. Of all people, Americans should know that a policeman implements laws made by and for the people that he polices, under a government whose legitimacy derives from its being their own. Police other nations and there will be no such assumed legitimacy. Without acquiescence you can only impose. America does not have the brute power to impose, nor the right. I said that not only can America not police the world but that she should not. With whatever good will you set out with – …on your policeman’s beat, your decisions must in the end take account of your own interest. How can it be otherwise? Faced with a conflict between the interests of the American people and anywhere else in the world, how can a democrat believe that Washington can or would stand blindfold in disinterested judgment between the two? We act, in the end, in our own interests. Finally, I said that America won’t police the world. I don’t believe it is the will of the American people. I’m not a narrow horizon Englander. I was born in Africa, schooled in Cyprus, Zimbabwe. My family lived for five years in Jamaica. I was at school in Swaziland and for two years at Yale University. I know a bit about America and Americans. And I think there’s something different about you. I think that even if you could police the world, I don’t think that Americans want to police the world. I don’t think that Americans are isolationist. I think that on occasions America has to intervene abroad, has to respond, has to defend herself. But I think it’s in the instincts of the American people to demand of their statesmen that reasons are given for that. There will never be a long, longstanding will among the American people for international intervention. Curiously enough, I Though you think your argument faces a tough test before an audience of internationalist New Yorkers, it’s out there in the sticks, among the right, where it will finally flounder. I know those people. I represented them in England. They are conservatives. You, Max, Douglas and your cartload of doctrine and theory, are not. I beg to oppose the motion."

    "data":"Okay, thank you, thank you very much, it’s very good to be here. And thank you for listening to me, it’s good to be another Brit here, partly, partly so that you don’t all think that Brits think like Matthew Parris…It’s an odd position to be in, perhaps some of you think to have somebody from another nation coming along to you here and saying, effectively, please police me… A strange misquote of that wonderful thinker Engelbert Humperdinck…But it’s not quite as masochistic as it sounds when we talk about the world’s policeman, a lot of people assume up the idea of force, and that you have the right to do it because you’re powerful. I don’t think that is what the reason is, that America has the right to be and should continue to be as it currently is the world’s policeman. It’s not your force as a nation which I think allows you that right, it’s America’s virtues that allow it that right. It’s the fact that, when America goes into a country like Afghanistan or Iraq, you don’t do the things which previous great powers did, that the moment, if anything this is a failing, if anything, when you go into a country like Iraq, you don’t say how long can we stay here, but how soon can we get out. You want to dabble as little as possible in the world--I think that’s a virtue. You know when you have to intervene. But you also know when you have to get out. But, uh, to clear up some of the mistakes from other side already, just because you’re the world’s policeman doesn’t mean you don’t have allies. It doesn’t mean you don’t have friends and others who will do the job, who’ll join you in the job. America in the last few years, despite the caricature of her greatest enemies, is not the unilateral organization that a lot of people would portray her as being. Now, as my two colleagues and comrades on my side have already intimated to you, there are really only two reasons not to vote for the right side if I may, in this in this motion. The first is that you think that the world does need a policeman, but that someone else can do it. Someone else will step up for the job. We’ve heard quite a lot at the moment, uh, from people talking more I think in glee than sorrow about the rise of China, for instance. You can look in your papers any day and see what the rise of China would bring in its wake if you wanted them to police the world, look at the athletes for instance going to the Olympics, being, attempting to be forbidden from speaking out about any Chinese abuses whilst they’re there. You want a perpetual silencing like that across the globe? You don’t see America trying to do that, you don’t see America trying to silence her enemies. America is the only force I can think of which tolerates people standing up against it, shouting as loudly as possible, picketing its military institutions and all this kind of thing permits that. Think of another world power that would permit that kind of thing, or another policeman that wouldn’t object when people continue to rejoice in poking it in the eye. Who else might be on the horizon? You might see, there’s a lot of talk for instance at the moment about Saudi Arabia. We have a lot of talk about that in Britain at the moment with our Archbishop of Canterbury, or soon to be promoted to the Grand Mufti of Canterbury. Saying that he wouldn’t mind Sharia law in Britain, I was sitting opposite a clerical goon two mornings ago in London who was explaining to me, Sheik Sewit Hassan [PH], what the sharia that he would like to bring to Britain would be and that, yes, we should cut off hands, we should stone women to death, because it would teach the others, and he hadn’t seen any adultery in Saudi Arabia. And I pointed out you don’t actually often see adultery happening, but—But you might get those kind of global systems if you, if you wish it hard enough, if you wish hard enough for America to fall, for America to be poked in the eye. But what will you do, who will sort out these problems, who will sort out a problem like Iran, when you have years of talks and the only progress you’ll really hear of is Iran getting closer and closer to its desired objectives of nuclear power. So that’s the first reason, the first reason why you would vote against this motion, the second, is that you think that the world doesn’t really need a policeman. It will be just fine without one. This, ladies and gentlemen, is, I think, a terrible, terrible illusion, it’s a siren call which has called across history to people. It called to the people of Athens two and a half millennia ago when Demosthenes warned them of the threat from King Phillip and said you do have other people who will tell you, if you ignore this threat, you will save money, and you’ll be able to spend it on other things… But, I know that if you listen to them, you will one day wake up, and you’ll realize how much this optimism cost you. You’re in the same position today, ladies and gentlemen. As people have been throughout history, as the person—the famous journalist who before the First World War wrote that, war in Europe was now an impossibility, because it was so economically unviable. Well it turned out to be more unviable for more reason than economics and people did it anyway. You will not be able to live in a world in which no one acts as your policeman. And let me cite one example of where the virtue of American intervention has been cited already by Max Boot, is not only necessary but vital and I’d cite the case of Kosovo. This might well come back again and again later. But, when the concentration camps in Europe reopened in the 1990s in the Balkans, and when we saw an ethnic genocide, an ethnic cleansing, from a third-rate tin-pot dictator and the European governments couldn’t stop it, who was it who had to stop in. It wasn’t France, France provided us with a phalanx of lawyers, and a leak. America provided us with 98% of the world—the air power, and they stopped a genocide, that’s no small achievement, ladies and gentlemen, I will—could go through all of the things which Ellen Laipson said, of the problems that you have enforcing, as nobody says that it’s good being the world’s policeman, nobody says it’s enjoyable, nobody would want the job. Other than people who you wouldn’t want to have the job. And, if Matthew Parris— It’s always wary when somebody opens with compliments. Mr. Parris describes my cause, our side’s cause, I think your cause is a doomed cause.” If it were a doomed cause, ladies and gentlemen, if my cause were a doomed cause, it would mean that our cause as a civilization is a doomed cause. It is I think too early to try to give up like that. Thank you."

    "data":"Good evening. Delighted to be here. Let me first say I fully expected in a couple of minutes when we see the numbers for and against the motion that I’m against the motion, I expect most of you are against the motion. When we vote at the end, I know a lot of you, if it’s really skewed on the side of being against the motion are gonna want to give these guys a couple of votes. It’s kinda like wanting to vote for Huckabee right now. He’s still in the game. And there’s stylishness and you kinda want to give him a little something for being in the game and taking the side. But we all know we can’t get there. And that’s where I am, look, Michael Mandelbaum made very clear that there are only two ways you can agree with me. Number one, you have to believe that the world doesn’t need a global policeman, or number two, that there is a better system out there than having a global policeman. That’s spoken like a true academic. I agree with both of those things. I think the world does need a global policeman, I think it would be the best system if the US was…the global policeman. But I also think we are incapable, and unprepared to do it. So, I’m trying to be a realist. I’m trying to look at what we can actually do, the limitations of our power, look, I need a loving family, but my mom and dad died of cancer, I’m sorry, I’m not gonna get there. That’s kind of—it’s true, but it’s—I’m not looking for sympathy. My point is, we’re just—or laughter. But we’re, we’re not going to get there. And that’s really the crux of my argument, now, let me make a couple of points here. The first is I fully agree with the notion that the world desperately needs leadership. We are in a situation where global architecture is not catching up to the radical change in geopolitical shift. The United States doesn’t have the lifting power it used to, China’s growing like crazy. Energy’s increasingly coming from unstable parts of the world. NATO’s ineffectual. Security Council’s ineffectual, the proliferation regime is broken. Don’t even get me started on climate change. Lord knows, you need a leader, to take advantage of this, and to move the system in the direction that we will all be able to live more secure, more prosperous lives. I do believe the United States needs to fill as much of that void as possible, the United States needs to be a global leader. Condi Rice said as much at Davos a couple weeks ago. The Russians strongly disagreed, they said the world does not need a conductor for the orchestra. And then Shimon Peres, the closest to Henry Kissinger on the panel, said, what we really need is a composer. Not a leader. And I think the world does need a leader. I think a policeman is a very different fact on the ground, look. When we talk about a policeman I think about enforcement, and I think about Max Boots on the ground. I don’t think we have the political will in this country, I don’t think we have the political capital in this country, and I think trying to argue that we do, risks a growth of anti-Americanism abroad. But more importantly and more dangerously, it risks a rise of protectionism in the United States, it risks a rise of neo-isolationism in the United States. Look at the Pew polls, look at how Americans increasingly feel about support for free trade. Look at how they increasingly feel about whether or not they believe America has benefited from the way the world system is evolving, they don’t. Part of the reason they don’t, I suspect, is because folks in the Ninth Ward in New Orleans don’t feel like they’re doing as well as they should. And they don’t necessary like the idea of giving billions of dollars of aid after a tsunami in Indonesia when we can’t build our own homes in New Orleans. I am not suggesting we shouldn’t be giving the billions of dollars in aid, I firmly believe we should. But I think that taking on the role of global policeman creates far more sentiment in the United States in opposing the world of good the United States does and should continue to do. Let me be specific on a couple of issues. Iran. The United States desperately needs to help reduce the threat of Iran. How might we do that? Effective sanctions? Look at who provides refined product to Iran, from around the world, it’s not the United States. It’s the Europeans, it’s the Indians. You want to be a global policeman on Iran, you better get their support. How about shutting down their accounts, the accounts of the Quds force, um, or of the Revolutionary Guard. Better get support from Dubai. It’s not the United States. The US in a globalized world can’t act as a global policeman, with one of the most important conflicts facing us today. Lord knows they’d like to try, but unless you’re arguing that this is gonna be the next American military intervention— and there doesn’t seem to be much direct support for that even among the most ardent neoconservatives in the United States—you’ve got a serious problem. How about a place where we can’t even argue about military support, how about North Korea. The United States said, if the North Koreans develop a nuclear weapon, we are gonna be very, very angry. And the North Koreans tested a nuclear weapon, and you know what, the anger in Washington was palpable. But we didn’t do anything, and we went back to the Chinese, and the Chinese said, we told you you don’t have a military options, sanctions aren’t gonna work, now let’s sit down at the table and work with them. The United States said yeah, you’re right, okay, we’ll sit down and we’ll talk to you. At the end of the day, I’d love to be in a position where the Americans could be the global policemen on Iran and North Korea, it would be a better system, it’d be a safer system. But we can’t do it, and the more we try to do it, by ourselves in that role——the less—the, the more incapable we’re going to be, okay, two final points since I only have a minute. First point is, what I like in terms of leadership is what Bob Zoellick did, vis-à-vis the Chinese, is talk about stakeholdership, and the Chinese originally didn’t know how to translate that word but once they did they kinda figured it out. We need more responsibility from the actors that are becoming vastly more powerful every day, every year vis-à-vis the United States. We’re increasingly going to be unable to be in favor of this motion, in four years, in eight years, in 12 years, we’d better prepare for it, by getting more stakeholdership, leadership, and dare I say global policemanship, from the folks around the world that can increasingly take some of that lifting regionally. Final point. Indispensable nation. Madeline Albright came up with that term, actually originally from James Chase, one of my mentors, I fully admit the United States is an indispensable nation. But you know what? If you’re the indispensable part of a family, if you’re the husband, if you’re the father, you do not go out, and buy a house you can’t afford, with a mortgage you can’t service. What you do, is you actually get your apartment, you bring home the bacon, you keep your nose down, and you ensure that you are there in a sustainable way. We need to recognize, that we have to eat within our means. We’ve got a serious problem with that in the American economy, I fear we have a serious problem with that in terms of global security, and I truly hope as a consequence you’ll vote with us against the motion, thank you very much."

    "data":"Well, don’t hold it against me. Thank you. Thank you very much. It’s great to be here tonight. Dan and I are here with the task of convincing you why diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere. And I think it’s important as we begin thinking about this issue to stop for a moment and ask yourselves, What is our current diplomacy with Iran? What’s the current state of affairs? The current state of affairs is that the Obama Administration has privately and publicly offered direct, unconditional talks to the Iranian regime. The Iranian regime has failed to respond. So as of now, there is no diplomacy with Iran. There are no talks. Even if there were talks tonight, Dan and I want to describe for you why it is that those talks, in fact, are going nowhere, and it’s for three reasons. There are really three elements that should be present in any set of diplomacy to have any chance for that diplomacy to succeed in preventing the Iranians from obtaining a nuclear weapon. First, the current set of diplomacy of diplomatic outrage by the Obama Administration includes no threat, no credible threat of military force should the diplomacy fail. Secondly, there is no time line in place that would prevent the talks from dragging on and on and prevent the Iranians from using the talks as an excuse to continue to develop their nuclear program. And third, none of the very crippling economic sanctions that might actually convince the Iranians that the cost of attaining a weapon is too high are in place. Now, let me just be clear. Dan and I are not arguing that force is necessary. We’re not arguing that military force is unavoidable and we’re not arguing that diplomacy itself is doomed to fail. We’re simply arguing that the current course we’re on is, in fact, a course to nowhere. Now, as you think tonight about your vote with respect to this resolution, one of the really important things to consider, which the Obama Administration has not been considering, is the history of American efforts to reach out to the Iranians. And I wanted to just run through for you tonight a few of the high points of that history, because any realistic effort to use diplomacy effectively has gotta take that history into account. In 1979 National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski met in Algiers with the Iranian Foreign Minister, Prime Minister and Defense Minister. And according to a note taker who was present in the meeting, Brzezinski told the Iranians, quote: We will accept your revolution, we will recognize your country, we’ll recognize your government, we’ll sell you all the weapons that we contracted to sell the Shah. Three days later the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was seized. Two weeks later the Iranian officials Brzezinski met with had lost their jobs. In 1980 Warren Christopher negotiated the Algiers Accord with the Iranian regime. The Iranians agreed to take no further hostile actions against the United States. Three months later they seized the American, seized new American hostages in Lebanon. One year later they attacked the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and three years later they killed two hundred and forty-one Marines in their barracks in Beirut. Throughout the 1990s the Europeans threatened to impose sanctions if the Iranians didn’t alter their behavior. The Iranians did not alter their behavior and the Europeans did not impose sanctions. In 1996 Iran was responsible for bombing Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, killing nineteen American soldiers. Despite this attack in the late 1990s Washington decided it was time to try again, to extend yet another hand to the Iranians to build a new relationship. We lifted parts of our sanctions program allowing food and humanitarian efforts, or humanitarian supplies, into Iran. And the President and the Secretary of State gave speeches essentially apologizing to the Iranians for past American behavior. In response, the Iranian Supreme Leader said these apologies were, quote: Too little too late and did no one any good since the Americans continue to commit such crimes. Now, you can read a much fuller account of this part of the diplomatic history in Ken Pollack’s terrific book, which I really do commend to you, called The Persian Puzzle. You’re welcome. But to, to be fair, though, it’s not just Ken who has been involved in failed attempts to reach out to the Iranians. Nick and I have also have our fair share of that, as well, when we both worked in the Bush State Department. 2004, the European Union III completed the Paris Agreement with the Iranians in which they promised to suspend enrichment activities. In August of 2005 Ahmadinejad was elected. They announced they were continuing their enrichment activities and the Russians prevented us from attaining any real sanctions against the Iranians at the United Nations. In 2006 we took the step of offering for the first time in thirty years direct negotiations if the Iranians would give up their enrichment program and our European allies committed to imposing tough sanctions if they didn’t. The Iranians didn’t give up the enrichment program and, of course, our allies wouldn’t allow us to impose tough sanctions. In 2007 the National Intelligence Estimate, parts of which were declassified, showed there is one thing, actually, that the Iranians did respond to. Although the Iranians did continue to enrich uranium they did halt other parts of their nuclear weapons program in the immediate aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. In 2008, despite the fact that the Iranians had failed to meet any condition we had set for direct talks and despite the fact that they were funneling weapons and terrorists into Iraq to kill Americans, we sent our Undersecretary of State, Bill Burns, to meet with the Europeans and Iranian representatives. Once again the Iranians learned that no red line is really a red line. To sum up this history let me quote from the man who was actually the note-taker at that first meeting in Algiers in 1979. He’s our current Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates. Describing this meeting recently, Secretary Gates said, quote: Every administration since then has reached out to the Iranians in one way or another and all have failed. Some have gotten into deep trouble associated with their failures, but the reality is the Iranian leadership has been consistently unyielding over a very long period of time in response to repeated overtures from the United States. In closing let me just say that the history of our attempts to reach out to Iran offer us lessons about the three things that might actually work in terms of inducing Iranian effort, in terms of stopping Iranian efforts to attain a nuclear weapon. We’ve gotta have a credible threat of the use of force if diplomacy fails. There have to be crippling economic sanctions that impose a significant cost on Iranian attempts to attain a weapon and we’ve gotta have a timeline so that the diplomacy doesn’t drag on forever. None of those things characterize our current nuke diplomacy with the Iranians. And therefore, diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. I’m delighted to be here. And thanks to Intelligence Squared for bringing all of you here for this important debate. I can think of no issue facing our country that’s more important to our future, more important to Israel, more important to our Arab partners than the issue of Iran. And I thank Liz for her remarks. It’s good to be on the same dais with Liz and Dan. They’re former colleagues of mine from the United States government, and Ken as well. We hope to convince you tonight, Ken and I, that actually, it’s very difficult to say that diplomacy is going nowhere with Iran when we haven’t started diplomacy with Iran. I have something to say about this and some familiarity about this. I was for three years the point person on Iran on the negotiations perspective for Iran for the United States government for President Bush and I never met an Iranian government official during those three years. With the exception of a couple of meeting in Baghdad between – and these were public meetings – between our Ambassador and the Iranian Ambassador to Iraq there were no sustained negotiations between the United States of American and the Iranian government. So we attempt, we want to convince you that we’ve gotta give diplomacy a chance. We can’t give up on diplomacy before we’ve started diplomacy. I think that’s the first thing I’d like to say to you. Second, it is important to remember a little bit of the history that Liz reviewed. We’ve had three decades of a non-relationship with Iran. It’s the most unusual diplomatic or non-diplomatic relationship we have in the world. Since the Iranian Revolution there have been times when American officials have talked to Iranian officials but there have been  no sustained negotiations on the nuclear issue and even on any other issue for many, many years. That’s not a situation that we should feel proud of. It’s certainly not a situation that advances our national interests. We have no diplomatic relations with the government of Iran. We have no business community, American business community, in Iran and haven’t for thirty years. There is no major presence of American journalists. So we’re in the extraordinary position of looking at a government that arguably poses the greatest challenges to the United States in the Middle East and yet we know precious little about that government. So that’s what this evening’s debate is really all about: how to be tough minded -- and I certainly agree with Liz and Dan on that -- about the Iranian government, but also there’s a twin challenge, a second challenge: how to engage that government sufficiently so that we have a much better understanding of what its bottom line is, of whether or not a deal is possible, about whether or not diplomacy can be successful in this case. President Obama intends to begin negotiations this summer, probably after the June 12th Iranian elections. My successor, Undersecretary of State Bill Burns, did meet with the Iranians once last year for a couple of hours. But the Obama Administration is about to test the proposition that perhaps we should have more extended discussions with the Iranians -- not because we’re acting of naivete, not because we’re weak, not because diplomacy is feckless, but because it’s our self-interest to gather information along with the Russians, Chinese and Europeans and see if there’s some way to maneuver the Iranians, pressure the Iranians away from a nuclear weapons future. I certainly agree that there’s a lot to worry about with the Iranians. They are seeking a nuclear weapons capability that would change the balance of power in the Middle East against us. They’re funding and directing most of the major Middle East terrorist groups that are a problem for us, for Israel and for our Arab partners. And because of their proximity to Iraq and Afghanistan they are fundamentally involved in both countries and in a way sometimes that’s very detrimental to the United States. But the problem I have, and I think the problem all of us have in looking at this question is, have the policies of the Clinton Administration and even the administration in which I served, the Bush Administration have they succeeded? Policies of isolating the Iranians, policies of refusing to meet with Iranian government officials, calling for regime change against Iran -- I would submit that those policies have not worked. And the test of any American policy is not whether we feel good about them or feel good about giving speeches. It’s are they effective? And therefore I think that President Obama is right to, to embark on a new path. What is that? It’s a combination of engagement with Iran and also pushing back against Iran to protect Israel, to protect United States’ interests. And what would that negotiation look like? The United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China would be on one side of the table with Iran on the other. We would be arguing that Iran should cease and desist in its nuclear weapons ambitions, cease and desist in its support for terrorism. The only way to make that point effectively at this point is to stand opposite them and to engage them. Now, I agree with Liz. We’ve gotta be very tough minded. We’ve, I think President Obama would be well advised to put a time limit on these negotiations so that the Iranians don’t run out the clock. He’d be well advised to keep the military option on the table because that is language that the Iranians would understand, and certainly well advised to say to the Iranians, If negotiations don’t work we are prepared to put Draconian economic sanctions on you. Because we’re not gonna give up on this fight to make the Middle East safe from an increase in Iranian power. Why try diplomacy? First, it’s the only way we will ever know if a peaceful outcome is possible. It’s the only way we’ll ever know if we can avoid a war in the Middle East. Second, we already have two wars underway in the greater Middle East – in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unless it is absolutely necessary do we Americans want to embark on a third war? Third, negotiations will actually isolate the Iranians. It’ll put the United States on the offensive for the first time in a long, long time and it will actually increase international leverage against the Iranian government. And fourth, we are no worse off if we try diplomacy because if negotiations fail we will be in a much stronger position than I was as the person negotiating with Russia and China and the Europeans, to say to them, especially to Russia and China, We did what you asked, we tried diplomacy. Now you need to back us in very tough sanctions against the Iranian government. You need to put the weight of your governments behind the United States. We’ll be in a much better place to say that, to be convincing about that if we try diplomacy first. I don’t see how we can say that negotiations and diplomacy are going nowhere if we haven’t made a concerted attempt to try diplomacy first, backed up by a very tough minded American policy. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you. Thank you, John. And it’s good to be on this panel with Liz and Ken and Nick, who probably all agree on more things than we disagree. But certainly on this issue there is disagreement. It’s also always good to be considering debating a potential conflict – heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf -- while in the heart of the Upper East Side. Liz and I are really advantaged in this and it’s live on BBC, no less. I just want to pick up on something Nick said, that it is hard to say that diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere if it hasn’t really begun. I would say he’s right, the second part of that – that it really hasn’t begun. But it’s not for lack of trying. I think it’s important to evaluate not only the history that Liz went through, in terms of the decades of efforts to negotiate and deal with Iran, but also actually look at just the last few months and the signals that this administration has sent to Iran, even before this administration took power. In 2007 and 2008, while this country was consumed with this fresh face on the scene Senator Barack Obama – so was the world. There was deep, intense election night coverage in the United States but also on Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya and the Arab satellite channels and the different news broadcasts throughout the Middle East. They actually covered primary, they have their own primary election night specials in the region – the best political team in Abu Dhabi coverage, or whatever you want to call it. And they were consumed with this. They were consumed with it for a number of reasons, not the least of which is so much of Barack Obama’s message was a clear rejection of U.S. foreign policy under George Bush. In fact, in the Democratic primary, one of his sharpest criticisms against Senator Hillary Clinton at the time was that she was basically a closet hawk, that she would represent somewhat of a continuation of Bush foreign policy. And the issue he specifically drew contrast with her on that was Iran, because she had supported some tough sanctions that related to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. And, and Obama called this a continuation of Bush policy on Iran. There is going to be change. And the American people overwhelmingly voted for this new face, this change, this rejection, if you will, which was a centerpiece of now President Obama’s campaign – overwhelming voted and sent a message to the world that there would be a new policy. Barack Obama’s inaugural address with President Bush sitting a few steps away, he issued some pretty sharp, very public criticisms while the world was watching of the former administration’s foreign policy over the previous eight years. He then in his first hundred days made good on his commitment on Iraq, which is basically to move along some sort of timeline for withdrawal, which was a big issue for the Iranian government. He has in recent weeks been very assertive about his plans for pursuing aggressively a two-state solution on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – another important issue to the Iranian leadership. He traveled to Europe and gave a series of speeches in which, again, he almost apologized for U.S. foreign policy over the previous eight years and made clear that things were going to change. And then finally and most importantly, he was issued an unconditional invitation to sit down with the Iranian government, in defiance, I might add, of three Security Council resolutions that call on the Iranian government to halt its nuclear program. President Obama is putting himself out there. He is really exposing himself by making such a clear and bold initiative for diplomacy. The only problem is, despite all this, against all this backdrop, the Iranian government still has not returned the call. So it is true that diplomacy has not begun. But it is not for a lack of trying. As Dennis Ross, who is currently advising President Obama on Iran policy today, has said in a report that was issued by the Bipartisan Policy Center late last year, If we have to chase the Iranians to the table then any hope of diplomacy is off the table. We can, there can only be a truly viable diplomatic track if we can get to the table quickly, both sides agree that there is a real diplomatic process. At the moment we are chasing the Iranians to the table. We are off to an unwinnable start. So I would just simply say that it is true that diplomacy has not begun but it is not for a lack of trying, which raises questions about where it is actually going. And finally, I would just pose the following question to Ken and to Nick: If you argue that it hasn’t gotten off the ground but it will get off the ground, the question is, What is your timeline? I commend a report to all of you that came out today issued by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Iran. Chairman John Kerry of the Senate Committee hired an investigative journalist and hired a number of other journalists and former Intel officials who actually traveled around the region to really get their own independent assessment of how far Iran is from having a nuclear weapon. And the report was issued this afternoon. You can get it on the Foreign Relations Committee website. It’s very clear. The time for inaction is narrowing. So if we say diplomacy hasn’t begun and we gotta let the beginning, the path to the commencement take place, and then we’ll consider how long the actual diplomatic process will take, is a tough sell, given the timeline that many are projecting, including as of today the most recent, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Finally I would say the question that needs to be considered is, What is the nature of the regime we are dealing with in Iran? If we believe that there is a possibility of diplomacy being successful, if that is our objective to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon on this path, what is the nature of the regime? Is it a—one possibility is that it is a radical theocracy – in which case I’m not convinced they can be persuaded against a nuclear weapon. And if they are driven by some sense of martyrdom and some sense of inevitable outcome that is worth sacrificing their country I’m not convinced that they can be persuaded that they should not have a nuclear bomb. Perhaps they’re rational and a nuclear bomb would bring them national power, it would deter U.S. threats in the future, it would cement potentially their hegemony throughout the region. And if they’re rational and that’s what this is about, I believe there are no inducements we can offer them. There are none that, no carrots that would be better than all that they would gain from having a nuclear bomb. So if we are going to pursue some sort of diplomatic path it must have a real timeline that is narrow and it must be backed up by a very credible threat of military force and a very credible threat of crippling sanctions and a real clearly defined publicly available trigger point for those actions to take place. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you all. It’s wonderful to be here. Thank you, John, and Liz also, for the plugs for my books. I can’t appreciate that enough. I promise to get you a check later on. And it is wonderful to be up here with my friends, with Dan, with Liz, with Nick, debating a very important topic. I thought I’d start where Nick left off. I thought I’d start by talking a little bit about the potential for a peaceful resolution. And we need to recognize that there is the prospect. We don’t know – and I say this as someone who has studied Iran for over two decades – at the CIA, at the Department of Defense, at the National Security Council and the think tank world. We don’t really know what the Iranians want. We don’t really know what they’d be willing to give. And in direct answer to Dan’s question of what might it take...Why have they not taken the choice already? Well, we haven’t put the choice to them directly. The choice that we need to put to them is a very simple one. You get to have a good, thriving economy which is ultimately what the people of Iran want or you get a nuclear weapon. But you don’t get both. The critical thing that you need to keep in mind – and I don’t think that Liz and Dan necessarily disagree with that -- but the critical thing that you need to get, keep in mind is how we get to that choice, how we force the Iranians to recognize that they get to have one or the other, not both. They don’t get to have their cake and eat it, too. I agree that this regime in Iran is not yet ready to sit down and compromise with us. I think they’ve made a tactical decision to talk to us. They have not made the strategic decision to compromise with us. And so the question becomes, How do we get them to that point? Well, as Liz very nicely described, we tried, when I was first in the Clinton White House, at the NSC, working on Iran. It was 1995-96, the period when the Clinton Administration, of which I was a part and working on Iran, imposed comprehensive unilateral sanctions against Iran. And these sanctions hurt. Do not believe for a second that those sanctions were meaningless. They hurt Iran and they hurt Iran to this day. But they haven’t hurt Iran enough toforce them to make that choice, to make it the way that we want them to. Later on we tried in 1998-99, my second time in the White House, to bring the rest of the world on board because we recognized that the only way to put that kind of pressure on the Iranians was to get the support of the world, to get them on board with the same kind of sanctions which could inflict the kind of pain on the Iranians that would force them to make that choice, the choice that they’re trying to avoid. And what we found was that the rest of the world wasn’t ready. And Nick and Liz tried the same thing during the Bush Administration and they found the same thing. And what we consistently heard over and over and over again was, You have not made a good faith effort with the Iranians. You’ve not put a deal on the table that they might accept, you have not given them a chance to say yes. Now we can debate about whether that’s true or not, but the simple fact is, that’s what the rest of the world believes. And until we convince them otherwise, they’re not gonna join us in imposing harsher sanctions on Iran, the kind of sanctions that might force the Iranians to come to that decision. Now the second thing that I wanna do, is to talk a little bit about what happens if we stop the diplomacy. Because we do need to think about that, it’s the elephant in the living room. If we’re not talking to Iran we’ve gotta be doing something else. And as I said, unilateral sanctions, no matter how clever both the Clinton and Bush administrations were in imposing unilateral sanctions, those don’t seem to be enough. And so if those aren’t gonna be enough, and we’re not gonna try to diplomacy, that is the one way that we might be able to get international support for the kind of harsh sanctions on Iran that might change their mind, well, alternatives start to look a lot worse. And I say that as someone who is very realistic about the chances of diplomacy with Iran. I could add, Nick could as well, a halfdozen other problems to the ones that Liz and Dan have already mentioned. Okay, we’ve been through it, we know how hard it is to deal with the Iranians. But the simple fact is, that diplomacy is much better than any of the other options, all the options stink. But some of ‘em stink a lot worse than others. Option one, we could do nothing. We could sit back and try to contain the Iranians, and deter them once they’ve got nuclear weapons. I don’t know about the rest of you, but that’s a social-science experiment I’d prefer not to run. Okay? We don’t know what the Iranians will do when they have a nuclear weapon, I tend to doubt they’d actually use it, but I’m not certain, and I wouldn’t want to find out that I was wrong. And even if I am right about it, we’re going to face an aggressive Iran, one that is going to be much more willing to support its terrorist allies, all across the Middle East. The last thing that the Middle East needs is more trouble, more instability, more Iranian-assisted troublemaking in the region, and that’s exactly what we get, if we allow them to have the nuclear weapon. Another alternative is regime change. We go in there and we decided we’re gonna get rid of the governments. And the way that people typically think about regime change in Iran is, we’re gonna spark a popular revolution. And people say that because the truth is that as best we can tell most Iranians don’t really like their government, and they’d like to see it changed. The problem with this is, that revolutions are very unpredictable, and they’re very rare. And we don’t really know how to get one started in Iran. And beyond that, we have what’s called, what I call the Groucho Marx problem. That every—remember Groucho once famously said that, he wouldn’t wanna be a member of any club that would have him as a member? Well, every Iranian oppositionist who accepts money from the United States of America, is totally not someone we should be giving money to. ‘Cause they probably work for the Iranian intelligence services, and they probably don’t have any support among the Iranian people, because since 1953, when we overthrew Mossadegh, we have been the third rail of Iranian politics. And the last option that’s out there, and I don’t think anyone on the panel is arguing for this but let’s remember it, is war. Okay. We can try airstrikes against the Iranian nuclear program. But don’t think that this is gonna be a quick surgical strike. Okay, the Iranian program is big, it is dispersed, it is hardened. It is going to require hundreds if not thousands of sorties, to take down that program. And most of the intelligence people I’ve spoken to including the Israelis, believe that even a wildly successful strike would probably only set the program back by one or two, maybe if we got really lucky, three or four years. And the Iranians will retaliate. And they will rebuild. And we will have to strike again. Okay. This will not be a surgical operation, it will as Nick said, be an open-ended war. Another open-ended war in the Middle East. These are all paths that we may have to confront at some point in time, but I’d suggest to you that we shouldn’t do so, until we have made sure that there is no diplomatic solution. We’re not there yet. And let’s just remember, the very wise words of Franklin Roosevelt, a man who was determined to wage World War II because he knew it was the right thing to do. But who famously once said, that jawjaw is better than war-war. Thank you."

    "data":"First of all, Juliette and I wanted to acknowledge the three and a half decades of public service that General Hayden has done and also Richard Falkenrath's more than a decade of public service. I also wanted to acknowledge Juliette Kayyem's decade and a half of public service where she became the highest ranking Arab-American in the Obama administration, the assistant secretary to the Department of Homeland Security. She also had three kids that she raised at the same time, putting home into Homeland Security in a meaningful sense -- and is one of the world's leading experts on the question of homeland security. My own connection to the story came when the Trade Center was bombed for the first time in '93. I traveled to Afghanistan, produced a documentary about the threat we face from Afghanistan and then, of course, interviewed bin Laden.  I've written three books on the subject of Al-Qaeda. I've embedded with our troops on multiple occasions in Iraq and Afghanistan.  From a self-interested point of view, I have every incentive to say the threat that Al-Qaeda and terrorism poses to us remains very serious. And it merits on open-ended conflict against them; but in good conscience, I simply can't make that argument. War is no longer the most appropriate way to look at the problems we face today. Our singular focus on terrorism also masks many more pressing problems. Our crumbling infrastructure, our decaying schools, deeply serious economic problems.  Another national security problem is managing the future of the Arab Spring, for instance; preventing nuclear war between Pakistan and India; preventing a nuclear war between North Korea and South Korea; managing the rise of China which, while we’ve been distracted by the War on Terror, has quietly expanded its influence in Africa and in Southeast Asia.  Our opponents want to prolong the War on Terror, an open-ended conflict against a tactic that is already America's longest war. We're saying it's time for war to end.  President Obama correctly redefined this conflict downwards from a global open-ended conflict against the tactic to the more precise formulation of a war against Al-Qaeda and its allies, which both names the enemy and narrows the focus of the conflict. When we say it's time for the War on Terror to end, we don't mean we should precipitously pull out of Afghanistan, but we do mean that it's time to stop conceiving our principle national security goal as the defeat of terrorists when putting, for instance, our own economic house in order will do far more to prepare us for the next real war we'll inevitably face at some point in the future.  The War on Terror, as everybody in the audience knows, has caused the American public at least a trillion dollars in expenditure and wars around the world and, of course, got us into the catastrophic Iraq War; further trillions on our -- both our Intelligence and Homeland National Security apparatus resulted in policies such as coercive interrogations and extraordinary renditions. And you'll hear from my partner that the government has for years anyway moved away from the War on Terror and what it entails, not because there was no threat. We're not claiming that at all but because the threat has changed and has adapted and so we must -- we as well.  Key American National Security officials now say that Al-Qaeda's on its last leg. John Brennan, who, of course, is President Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, said that just last week. Leon Panetta said that the strategic defeat of Al-Qaeda is within sight. General David Petraeus has made the same sort of comments recently. None of these gentlemen can be considered to be defeatist or soft on terrorism. So is this premature triumphalism the claim that Al-Qaeda is on its last legs? Well, I think the claim is well-justified. I mean, the leadership of Al-Qaeda's been completely decimated in the campaign of drone attacks. The most dangerous job in the world right now has been Al-Qaeda's number two. There have been about 20 of them since 2008, including most recently, the group's number two out here, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was killed just a few weeks -- just about a week ago.  Al-Qaeda hasn't carried out a successful attack in the West since the 7/7 attacks in London six years ago. Al-Qaeda hasn't killed a single American in the United States since 9/11.  And think about the real wars we've really confronted. The Civil War threatened to tear this country apart. World War II, we defeated an enemy that instigated a global conflict to kill tens of millions, and if the Cold War had ended with a bang instead of whimper, we'd all be not in this debate because we'd all be dead. Those are serious threats. The War on Terror -- the threat we faced from Al-Qaeda doesn't come close; and in fact, only 17 Americans have died as a result of Al-Qaeda's ideological ideas in this country, 13 of them, of course, at Fort Hood and others in other places. More Americans accidentally die in their own bathtubs every year by considerable numbers around 300, and we don't have an unreasonable fear of bathtubs; so we shouldn't have an unreasonable fear of Al-Qaeda.  And by terrorism [unclear], we're terrified, by the way, of course, and we're doing the job of the terrorist for them if we live in this state of constant fear that our opponents wish us to live in. And everybody in the audience knows very well that the threat from terrorism is actually dramatically receded in the years since the 9/11 attacks; and that's in part because Al-Qaeda and bin Laden have been losing the war of ideas in the Muslim world for years.  Their founder and leader was killed, as you know, in Abbottabad on the evening of May 1st. In the Arab Spring, there's not a single revolutionary who's carrying a single picture of Osama bin laden. Bin Laden's ideas have been completely absent from the Arab Spring. There hasn't been a single flag burning in the Arab Spring of an American flag or even an Israeli flag; so bin Laden's foot soldiers, ideas and leadership are simply absent from this enormously important phenomenon in the Arab world. Our opponents may claim that we're still threatened by terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction. This claim, of course, follows simply the disastrous war in Iraq; and in fact, the 188 jihadi terrorist cases in this country since 9/11, not a single one of them involved chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. We will no doubt hear from our opponents that to argue the War on Terrorism is overly soft or unrealistic or weak -- and they make claim that, at some point, we will decide we no longer need to define it as a War on Terror, but we aren't there yet. I would submit to you in the audience, if the death of the founder and leader of Al-Qaeda isn't the point where we can say the War on Terror is over and then add to that the destruction of almost its entire top leadership, its absence in the revolutions across the Middle East, its inability to mount any kind of attack on the United States for a decade isn't the point to end the War on Terror, when will that point be? We say it's now. "

    "data":"Well, good evening. Thanks for the opportunity to talk about such an important topic, and it really is an important topic. It's not something that we should just decide idly. It's not something we should decide because we're really in a celebratory mood. When I -- when I talk to audiences about the War on Terror, I generally refer to a speech I gave at the German Embassy in the spring of 2007. The Germans were in the chair of the European Union, and the German ambassador would have the ambassadors to the United States from the European Union over for lunch about every two weeks and would have an American come in to kind of be the lunchtime entertainment, and it was my turn. I decided that the German ambassador was a good friend, and he deserved a good speech; and I decided I would talk to the European Union delegates about renditions, detentions and interrogations that were being conducted by the CIA at that time. About page two or three of that speech, I wanted to make very clear to my audience what I thought, what my agency thought and what I think my nation thought. And I gave them four sentences. We believe we are a nation at war. We are at war with Al-Qaeda and its affiliates -- the description that Peter just gave and that President Obama emphasized that reflected what we were thinking several years earlier. A nation at war; At war with Al-Qaeda and its affiliates; This war is global in scope; and We can only fulfill our moral and ethical responsibilities to you, the citizens of this republic, by taking this fight to this enemy wherever he may be. George Tenet was the DCI, the Director of Central Intelligence. In 1999, sent a note out to all of us in the Intelligence community, saying We're at war with Al-Qaeda. And George was but America wasn't. America went to war with Al-Qaeda shortly after the attacks on September 11, 2001. Two successive American presidents have defined us as being at war with Al-Qaeda. The American Congress has defined us as being at war with Al-Qaeda; and the American court system, only a few blocks from here, has defined us as being at war with Al-Qaeda when a defendant, attempting to claim he had been denied his right to a speedy trial because he had been in detention for several years, his claim was rejected by the court, saying we, as a nation at war, had a right to detain him as a combatant. Now, we could discuss troop levels in Iraq, the rate of withdrawal from Afghanistan, a whole bunch of other details about this war, but that's not the point I think Rich and I want to make. The point we want to make is the legal construct -- the legal belief that we are a nation at war; that we are a nation in conflict; and we have a right, because we are in that status, to use the legal tools and the legal authorities that a nation at war is allowed to use. What it is we're supporting is to keep all available tools on the table -- to keep a menu of options from law enforcement, diplomacy, or to arm conflict in order to keep you safe. I would also add -- and I really want to emphasis this -- that conceiving yourself at war in addition to whatever it is you might do in a law enforcement channel is not somehow lawless. It is perfectly lawful. It is a different lawful approach than a law enforcement approach, but it is consistent with the laws of armed conflict that we have a right to resort to in order to defend ourselves. I assume everyone here is happy that Osama bin Laden was killed on the morning of the second of May in Pakistan. Let me give you -- thank you. Let me give you a slightly different description of that event. A heavily armed agent of the United States government was in a room with an unarmed man who was under indictment in the United States judicial system and was offering no significant resistance to the heavily armed agent of the United States government, and that heavily armed agent of the United States government killed him. If you do not think we are at war, there are some very troubling definitions that you might want to attach to that act. That's the kind of authority we have perfectly lawful -- and no way am I suggesting anyone acted inappropriately. We acted perfectly lawfully because we are a nation at war and generally recognized as such. You don't want to take those tools off the table while there are terrorists out there. If you let this tool go, you will be less safe. Okay. If you look at the scope of our constitutional system, the law enforcement approach is designed, if you look at the constitution, the Bill of Rights and the American statutory law, the law enforcement approach is designed to make the government weak because we don't want the government arbitrarily taking away your liberties. On the other hand, if you look at those sections of the Constitution that deal with armed conflict, they're designed to make the government strong so that it can protect you. You don't want to take that tool off the table. And quite perversely, if you take that tool off the table, you may actually threaten your own civil liberties. Bear with me. There's a tight connection here. If the options of a nation at war are taken away from your tool kit, you must then rely on the options offered by law enforcement. If you recall the events in -- on Christmas day a year or two ago, Detroit, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Underwear Bomber -- and he was Mirandized after about 50 minutes of interrogation, and I think everyone recognized that was probably a mistake. We should have interrogated him further. We had the attorney general talking to the American Congress about legislation that would make Miranda more malleable so that we could interrogate these kinds of people longer in our law enforcement approach. I don't want to make Miranda more malleable. Miranda defends me. Defends you. Defends your rights. And we're forced to contort the law enforcement approach when we attempt to make it answer and deal with questions it was never designed to deal with. This is one of those questions. Don't take that other tool, We are a nation of war off the table. Thank you. "

    "data":"So I want to thank Bob and Dana, Peter, Mike and Rich and the organizers of Intelligence Squared; and I also want to take a moment to acknowledge, obviously, tonight, 10 years later and the tragedy and burdens this city has suffered. We will debate with passion here but with the full acknowledgement that many of you suffered tremendously. The proposition I'm arguing for tonight is the War on Terror is over. That can mean a lot of things, obviously. For me, it means one thing. A certain mind-set came to be known as the War on Terror, and that mind-set, thankfully, is over. To explain what I mean, I want to tell you a story. I did reenter government in 2006 when Governor Deval Patrick became governor of Massachusetts; and one of my duties was to oversee the Massachusetts National Guard. I inherited a program that had been established on September 12 which was to put National Guard members on the roadways, leading up to our only nuclear facility, Pilgrim facility, and it was understandable in those days, you wanted to show greater force protection. More than five years later, they were still there, the National Guard members. Despite the tremendous work being done to counter the terrorist threat and despite no evidence that terrorists would seek to enter by road a heavily fortified facility, nobody involved with intricacies of that security thought that they were still necessary, but no one really knew how to pivot. It's very hard to pivot. And the political military and public input had to be aligned. It took us awhile, but eventually we did move on, and I tell that story not as evidence that the terrorist threat is over, not at all. I tell it to say that there were other procedures that we then put in place, more aggressive surveillance, sharing better surveillance of the streets, better communications between the nuclear facility owners and the local first responders that we instituted instead of the 19 National Guard members rotating 24/7. I tell this story to remind you that 10 years is a long time. It is a long time to fight any war but one particularly where the enemy has changed so dramatically. And over that time, there had been a whole range of shifts in every jurisdiction in the federal government that had been similar to the one I just described. So to just call the ongoing efforts to dismantle, kill and disrupt Al-Qaeda and its affiliates a continuity or continuation of The War on Terror -- capital T, capital W, capital T -- is to treat the United States and the government apparatus established since 9/11 as frozen in time. It assumes that there has been no learning, no growth, no perspectives achieved, no recognition of mistakes made, no priority shifts, no advancements in our abilities and capabilities. It assumes that time had stood still for us. In many respects this debate actually is a few years too late. The War on Terror, as it became known, was an entire government ideology, based on the notion that Islamic terrorism represented a unified and operationally centralized threat to manning a predominantly military response with the President as commander in chief who could use any means necessary. Nobody, especially people who have served in National Security, denied that there is still a terrorist threat, and the U.S. Government, under any administration, to pick up on General Hayden's point, is going to have a variety of tools to use to combat that threat, including military force. Nobody needs to make apologies for that, neither the left nor the right. The authorization for the use of military force passed immediately after 9/11, gave the President and the future ones the legal authorization to fight Al-Qaeda with force. It is still the law today, and it is still good law; but the fact that the government continues to use many of these same counterterrorism strategies, including killing bin Laden, of course, does not mean that the War on Terror and all that it entailed remain because we should go through the list -- the enhanced interrogation, the dark side, the with us or against us, the indiscriminate interviewing a particular Arab and Muslim communities, the registration of Arab immigrants, military tribunals that adhere to standards unrecognized in military law, the color code alerts, the breathless press conferences, the rejection of the law of wars, the treating of the Geneva Conventions as quaint, secret wiretapping and violation of established law, the disdain for the judiciary -- those were also part of that war. And thankfully, they are over, and they began to be over during the Bush administration and the continuation in this administration. It has not been more of the same, and that is good because we got better. Over these 10 years during both Bush and Obama administrations, the U.S. Security apparatus became more focused and sophisticated. It was because the threat had changed. It was more decentralized and disparate, and we have adapted to that, certainly, by using military tactics to kill Al-Qaeda affiliates worldwide, but we have also become more focused, measuring success by effectiveness over shear activity. And nowhere is this more true than in Homeland Security. Unlike war, Homeland Security is very bottom up. It begins with locals who run police departments or emergency management divisions or public health facilities. It is overseen by mayors and governors, and if you want to talk about a change in America, there's only one governor who was governor on 9/11 still in the State House, and he's debating in California right now because he doesn't want to be governor anymore. That's Rick Perry. So, I mean, there's just been tremendous change over these 10 years; and so calling it a War on Terror for them does not help them manage budget or defend certain programs or know actually how to prioritize. As Rich Falkenrath -- who helped institutionalize the phrase dual-use policies that help the cop on the street in fighting crime as well as in counterterrorism; that provide training for emergency managers for a tower falling as well as Hurricane Irene -- these are the most sustainable and effective. The color-code system seemed appropriate in an era that created a warlike climate but provided no clarity to the first responders on how to -- how to react, and the public rightfully rejected it. More localized efforts to engage immigrant communities or in nationally adopting to See Something, Say Something campaign that came out of New York City are good and effective government action, and they are necessary as we have reason to be concerned with radicalization in our own nation. None of these require military engagement or mind-set although, of course, as I've said, there might be a need for military engagement, and it's authorized by law. These are smart strategies adopted by people across the ideological spectrum. I am here not because I have some invested intellectual interest in saying the war is over. Military efforts will need to be utilized. That goes without saying. But do not forget what the War on Terror was, and do not forget how much progress we have made in moving past it. What has replaced it is a different way of thinking about the threat and our response. Surely, not everything is perfect, but criticism is accepted. There is nothing soft or weak or liberal about believing the War on Terror is over. It is actually the way the world is; and ask yourself Are we less safe now from having moved on? "

    "data":"That was a scary time, and happily it's over. Now, forgive my voice. I've got a little bit of a cold. It's a great pleasure to be here. Thank you to the organizers, the sponsors, to the other panelists, all of whom are long and close friends. We've known each other for a long time. Debates like this often turn on trying to convince the audience, the voters, of a definition; and if you get them thinking about a proposition defined your way, it's clear which side should prevail, and if you get them thinking about a proposition defined the other way, it's clear which side should prevail. And this is no exception to that rule. The War on Terror is a very open-ended concept, and it can be construed in many different ways. And Peter and Juliette are -- construe it in a way that really isn't that surprising, but they were very candid about it, frankly, which is they'd like it to be defined as a certain mind-set that we experienced some point in the past that we no longer should have today. And I find, if I were probably -- if I was on their side of the proposition, I'd argue it the same way because this is a tough one to argue if you argue it the way Mike and I think it should be argued which, in fact, Juliette agrees with, which is you need to make this an operational proposition. You need to define it in some very precise way so there's something really to weigh in on. It's not just some squishy mind-set and set of feelings. It's actually something practical. And here, in fact, it is something practical. War on Terror -- war is a legal state, as Mike said. It exists in law. It is decreed by Congress and, in fact, they did decree it in this case with the authorization for the use of military force, passed by Congress on Sept. 14, signed by President Bush on Sept. 18, and still in force today. And the way I understand this proposition that we're voting on here, is essentially -- Should we repeal or modify this in some way or another? And Mike and I say, No, we shouldn't. This should still stand. Juliette also agrees with us. She thinks it should stand too. I'm not sure where Peter is. But it's worth noting exactly what is says because this is what it means to be in a War on Terror. It means to have this as your law of the land. It says that the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11th or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any further acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons. Now, our position is quite simple: it's that this should stay the law of the land. This should be the law in the United States, because, if it's not, then something Peter said is no longer the case: having the number two job in al-Qaeda is no longer the most dangerous job in the world. It is today. And he's still there. The number two in al-Qaeda -- it's much, much diminished, decimated probably isn't too strong a word for al-Qaeda. But the number two officer in al-Qaeda on 9/11, Ayman al-Zawahiri, a shadow of the man bin Laden was, he's still alive. He's in Pakistan. But for this provision of law, we can't use military force unilaterally against him. This is what makes such action lawful, and without this, the alternative is to go arrest him, mirandize him, bring him back to the court, which is an option, which frankly I don't believe should be taken off the table, either. Probably not what we will end up pursuing in his case. But it simply makes no sense. It makes no sense to say you should repeal this. So that's my sort of first big point to you, is this is the law of the land. The war on Terror is a legal state that gives us opportunities to do things under the code of law, not extra-legally, so, if that commando team does go in and kill someone, it's not murder. It is, in fact, an act of war. Blessed by both branches of government -- the judiciary -- the executive and the legislative -- and without this, illegal. So, we don't want that. And this strikes me as, clearly, sensible to continue. Now, should it continue indefinitely? Who knows? I'm not prepared to say exactly when it should stop. But right now, today, when we know, some of the perpetrators of 9/11 are still at liberty, presumably in Pakistan. It really makes no sense whatsoever to repeal this. Now, Juliette and Peter would have us think instead about the proposition in a different way, and say, “It's about a mindset.” It's about that terrible state when John referred to when neighbors would look at a Senior White House Official's face to see how it was when he came home from work. Those days are happily over, and hopefully they'll never come back. That's really not the proposition here. Yes, there were lots of that we're -- if we want to have another proposition which was, did President Bush overdo it in the first four years after 9/11, that's a whole different debate. And maybe, they will prevail on that one. We're debating a different proposition here. This is not about whether we think President Bush got it just right in the first couple of years after 9/11 or not. This is also not really a partisan issue. And yeah, I worked for Bush. But I also worked for Mike Bloomberg. He--who knows what he is. I mean, he was a -- now he's independent. Then he was a Republican. At one point, he was a Democrat. This is not really a partisan thing. But Peter made an interesting point. He said President Obama has more correctly and more precisely characterized the continued offensive action against Al-Qaeda and its affiliates. And he's absolutely right, that the president -- President Obama's rhetoric is very different from President Bush's. They talked about it very differently. But the practice -- the nitty-gritty of what happens in counter-terrorism internationally, operationally, from the last four years of the Bush administration to today, in 9/11 -- not only is it fundamentally unchanged. Obama is tougher. He is harsher. He is sharper. I'll give you just one example. I understand -- Mike probably knows this -- I just hear it from the news. There is a list of individuals who may be targeted, by name, individually, for lethal air strikes. Under -- that list started under Bush. I think it notified to Congress. Under Bush, that list consisted of only non-U.S. persons. So, foreigners. If we are to believe what we read in the paper, President Obama has added a U.S. citizen to that list, who may be targeted by name. This is an extremely liberal, former constitutional law professor who has added a U.S. citizen to a list of people who may be targeted by name. Now, he does it because of this aspect of law, which consists today. That individual, Anwar Al-Awlaki, is in Yemen. He's a U.S. citizen. He is vulnerable to lethal strike today that are lawful under U.S. law. I submit today it makes no sense to repeal that law at this time, and thus, under the terms of this debate and the War on Terror. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you, John. And thank you, Bob, for hosting this. It's an honor to be here with Bernard-Henri Lévy and General Clark and Mort Zuckerman. One caveat before I make my presentation. I'm not here tonight to issue a sweeping critique of every decision of President Obama's foreign policy. In fact, there are some that I have been quite supportive of, quite publicly supportive of. I thought it was incredibly courageous of President Obama to take on his own political base and commit to doubling down our troops in Afghanistan. Effectively under his presence, he will have doubled our troop levels. Maintain the commitment, the agreement in Iraq between Prime Minister Maliki and President Bush, and our presence there despite having campaigned against it, vigorously during the 2008 presidential campaign. Nor will I issue a sweeping defense of the foreign policy decisions of President Obama's predecessor. There were some decisions that President Bush made that I was very supportive of, and some that I have been critical of. What I'm here to do tonight is try to focus this question along with my friend Mort here who comes at this issue, by the way, from different perspectives. He was a supporter of -- public supporter of President Obama. I was not. But we both have deep concerns about America's power in world affairs today: America's status in world affairs today. And whenever there has been a prospect of American decline as we think there is today, the -- one of the shock absorbers, if you will, to prevent that decline or at least slow it down, has been an enlightened understanding among Americans about America's role in the world, about American power. And the secret is not so -- not so secretive secret, is it's not just about American power, sort of an enlightened understanding of American power. It's about America's part of a liberal international order, about America as a builder of a Democratic world order. And you have seen these principles articulated, the notion that America helps to turn adversaries, whether there are autocratic regimes, totalitarian regimes, help them transition to democracies. You've seen this throughout American history. It's a bipartisan post World War II at least, bipartisan foreign policy commitment dating back to Truman and Acheson after World War II where they articulated certain principles. America will stand by Democratic allies around the world no matter what. America will stand by dissidents fighting for their freedom in human rights around the world no matter what. America will consult with its allies before it panders to its adversaries no matter what. And America will have a defense budget and military budget, not only to defend its own borders but to back up those principles and stand by its friends. And that is what I'm concerned about. Because you are seeing a realignment in American foreign policy today that backs away from those principles. Those principles are not Republican principles, they're not Democratic principles. As I said, you can look at Harry Truman, you can look at John F. Kennedy, America will bear any burden, pay any price to back up those principles. President Clinton, who under General Clark's superb leadership in the Balkans intervened to stop genocide in the heart of central Europe, in the spirit of human rights, in the spirit of helping out allies. And put American prestige on the line, by the way, not only American lives and resources but American prestige because he did it without U.N. support.President Clinton enlarged NATO, was willing to bring central and eastern European powers into NATO, and not let Russia's ambition for hegemony in the region hold those countries hostage. This is the spirit you've seen throughout our foreign policy transcending party lines have been exceptions, obviously, the Carter years, part of the Kissinger years, and today. Today it's more than just a flare-up. Today it's a realignment in U.S. foreign policy. You are seeing a strategic decision by this administration to basically send a message to our friends and allies around the world that they can't count on us for very good reason--the administration would argue, because we're in an effort to reach out to new quote unquote friends. We're trying to turn over adversaries. In so doing, we may have to compromise our historic friendships. Look at the -- this is just not an abstract discussion. You just look at where we are in the world today. Iran is closer to having a nuclear bomb today than it was a year ago. This isn't hyperbole, this is a fact. Despite pleadings from our friends and allies in moderate Sunni regimes in the Arab world and leaders in Israel. This is a fact. Leaders in eastern and central Europe were completely off guard when President Obama announced a unilateral revoking of our missile defense agreement in the Czech Republic in Poland just a few months ago, all in an effort to reach out to Medvedev and Putin in Russia. Lech Walesa who personifies the appreciation and gratitude that millions of people around the world feel for America standing by the principles I spoke about earlier, said after Obama announced that decision after his administration announced that decision, he said this just shows you, you can't count on the Americans. Lech Walesa. Nicholas Sarkozy, the president of France, has called the president's foreign policy naive. And in the U.K. where they talk about the symbol of a special relationship, the U.S. has had a unique relationship with the U.K. going back to Churchill and FDR, and certainly in the past 30 years that special relationship between Reagan and Thatcher, President George W. Bush and Thatcher President George W. Bush and John Major, Clinton and Tony Blair, and President George W. Bush and Tony Blair. And yet an open discussion in London, the special relationship between the U.K. and the U.S. is in jeopardy. Gordon Brown, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, had made five requests, five requests to have a one on one meeting with President Obama and couldn't get them to answer the phone. He wanted to meet at the UN, he wanted to meet at the G 20. Enormously embarrassing to the Brits. And Secretary Clinton, when she was in Argentina in March, she called on the British to reopen negotiations with Argentina over the Falklands, a wound that was in the process of healing 30 years ago and she ripped that scab off. A country -- to do this to the U.K., a country that has shed so much blood in its alliance with America and today has 10,000 troops in Afghanistan serving with us. So I would simply say that American alliances are in major jeopardy around the world. I think the message has been clear over the last 15 or 16 months that it’s a darn good time to be an adversary of America and it’s a pretty crummy time to be a friend and historic ally of America. And the moment our historic alliances and friendships believe that that they cannot count on America and its fidelity to the principles of Truman and Acheson, America truly will be in decline."

    "data":"John, thanks for that introduction. I’d like to be up here debating my own foreign policy, but that isn’t the debate. But this is a very, very important issue.

And thank you very much for moderating and thanks to all of you for being here. And for those of you who did support and donate to my presidential campaign, I thank you for that too. testified in front of Congress. I warned -- of course we knew our armed forces were going to do great. Why not? We’ve been practicing and building for it for years and years and years. It’s the war that everyone expected to fight. It was like, why is it taking us so long? So we went in there and just as we expected in three weeks or less, we were in Baghdad and Baghdad fell and that was the end of it and the troubles began. The truth is, when we’re talking about American foreign policy, it didn’t begin on the 21st of January, 2009. And so I want to establish three things tonight. First, that Barack Obama began in a deep hole. And the first rule of when you’re in a deep hole is stop digging and start getting out of it. The second thing is I think he’s doing a lot of things right, and third I want to address some of the things that Dan brought up here. So first of all, the deep hole. I don’t think there’s been any period in American foreign policy and domestic policy where we’ve seen so many crises and difficulties. It started with 9/11 when the administration basically ignored the experience of the Clinton administration, didn’t pay enough attention to terrorism and we got clobbered. It then went into a war in Afghanistan that didn’t target the correct enemy, that was just a scattering of bombs. Osama bin Laden was there; the military was never told to get him and he went to Pakistan. Then we withdrew our intelligence assets; we prepared to go to war with Iraq which for a variety of reasons that have never been fully explained, the administration was insistent on doing. That easy victory turned into a drawn-out, very expensive, very difficult insurgency. In the process, we lost friends and allies as they all fell by the wayside except for a couple of great allies like Britain and Italy. But the Europeans rightly had questions about how necessary this war was. We were no more in the deep insurgency then Katrina came and Hugo Chavez and others had to offer assistance to the United States because we couldn’t seem to take care of our own problems in Katrina. And then followed up by the financial collapse of 2007, 2008 which really put us in a hole as a nation that was in decline. So Barack Obama had a very tough road to hoe. I think he’s doing a lot of things right. He’s starting by trying to make more friends and fewer enemies in the world, so he’s reached out a hand of friendship to the Islamic world. His speech in Cairo was incredibly well received. He was nominated and received a Nobel Peace Prize based on the atmosphere he projected and that atmosphere goes a long way in international relations. He's kept our military strong. He has doubled down in Afghanistan. He's made it clear that there will be no easy path for terrorists in the United States. He stayed very tough on homeland security. He stuck with the commitments America made in Iraq. He's got a team in the Pentagon and elsewhere that will follow through on the effective policies of the previous administration and modify them where necessary. So I think he's doing a lot of things right in terms of keeping us safe. I think in terms of his work with NATO, they've made very strong presentations at the NATO summit. We brought in new members in NATO, Albania and Croatia, helping to fill out the Balkans and bring stability into that region. And we've worked on other areas like trying to open up Burma. He's broadened the dialogue so that when we go to the Asia Pacific economic groups and OCEON and talk over there, we're not just talking about pursuing terrorists. We're talking about all the other things that are important for us. And he's taken a major role in international economic affairs. And really, there is nothing more important for America at this point after you keep America safe than to rebuild this economy and to work with our friends and allies around the world to do that. And he's doing all of that. As far as Iran is concerned, and here I want to turn to the third point, let's talk about Iran. Because of going into Iraq, the Bush administration was never able to bring moral force or intelligence to bear on Iran. In fact, there was an erroneous intelligence report in 2007 that said they'd given up their nuclear program. So let's give the president time to sort of get traction in world affairs. He's had it. He's brought consensus to bear in the United Nations that Iran is not complying. All options are on the table. That chapter is not over by a long shot, I would predict. As far as missile defense is concerned, there is a better way to do it. That's a missile defense that we have right now on our navy ships that can intercept mid course. We may need to go back to Europe at a later time when Iranians deploy an inner continental ballistic missile, but they're a long way from having it right now. Inside Eastern Europe, the policy of putting the missile interceptors and the radars on the ground had adherence. It also had opponents. And what Barack Obama has done is focused on the essential element which is the rationale for putting those interceptors in place and the radar in place. That was to deter and reassure vis-a-vis Iran. And that's exactly what the policy he announced will do. Our Navy can do those intercepts. We do have that capability. It will be -- much more effective against Iran than the system that was being placed in the Czech Republic and Poland. I can't comment on what President Sarkozy said about Barack Obama's naivety. I'll leave those kinds of personal comments aside. But I think what you do have in the president is a man who is experienced in the world, a man who looks at the other side as well as what his own feelings are, someone who's running a pragmatic non-ideological policy, someone who's shown he's tough. He's hard headed. He means what he says. He's going to take America and lead us forward. I think you have to vote no to the idea that President Barack Obama's foreign policy spells America's decline. That's a no. Thank you."

    "data":"If you thought you were in pain before I spoke, wait until you see what it's going to be like after I speak.Good evening. I want to share with the other speakers the measure of being a part of this wonderful group and to speak to this audience. Let me just say when President Obama came into office, it was really a quiet sigh of relief around the world. He wasn't George Bush. The expectations No, I don't mean that. I think there was a huge concern in the world about the nature of American leadership at that point. And the expectations about President Obama were exceedingly high. Now, any president of the United States really inherits a great legacy. We stand at the top of the power ladder. We are not a dominant power but we're the leading power. We're the only power that can coordinate and coalesce groups of nations. Most countries distrust the United States less than they distrust one another. So they look for Washington -- to Washington for leadership. And they look for Washington to support them against regional opponents and other threats. They know they cannot solve most of these problems without the United States. And they need our leadership in the most severe and serious way. Now, my sense, however, is that President Obama on this level is uncomfortable with this role for the United States. He seems to be uncomfortable in leading a lot of other nations. And almost feels that there is nothing special about America's role in the world. What you have, it seems to me, is too much well intentioned belief in the power of rhetoric, good will, and too little appreciation of reality. The former president of the Council of Foreign Relations, Les Gelb put it, there is the impression that Obama confuses speeches with policies. Now, foreign policy entails an understanding of the cultural historical and personal political circumstances of those we are dealing with. And this is where I think we have a real problem. Because there is, I think, a critical mass of influential people in world affairs who once held high hopes for this president and have begun to wonder whether or not they have misjudged the man. In the Middle East they always talk about the following. There are two chess games that are always being played in the Middle East. One is the chess board that you see on top of the table. The other is the chess board that is below the table that nobody sees except the people who know how to play the game. And the sense that they have is that this administration does not know how to play the game and has made mistake after mistake after mistake to the point where there is really an erosion of confidence in the United States and limitation therefore on what we can accomplish. And it also has contributed to a growing perception that Obama's management of American power is almost amateurish. He tends to speak as a teacher rather than as a leader. Now, in meetings with many of the leaders of the Arab world, particularly the Sunni leaders, they fear an expansionist Iran proceeding with full speed ahead on a program to develop nuclear weapons on top of programs testing intermediate range missiles. I will give you an illustration of how a major foreign leader of an Arab country put it to me. When you remember Obama said if people extend a hand to shake our hands instead of a fist, we will shake that hand. He says the problem with Iran is you can't deal with it by shaking their hand. You have to deal with them by showing that your capable of exercising the fist. And that is what -- it is that understanding and that understanding of the culture, not just in the Middle East, but in many parts of the world that is missing. And what you have, you have the centrifuges continuing to spin in Iraq. And there is no sense, for example, when they had the uprising on the streets of Iran, that we were there with them, that we were on, as Fouad Ajami put it, on freedom's side. Now, the question is, is Iran going to be emboldened by what they see and experience as American weakness and the lack of real willpower? Well, as long as the Arab foreign -- the Arab foreign ministers put it the following one. One of them said -- now, this is a quote. He said they are hopelessly naive. The Americans are hopelessly naive. And they -- in that part of the world, naivety is not just naivety. It is seen as weakness as it really gives the impression that the leadership does not have the stuff that real leaders are made of. And that is the feeling that they have about America these days. Now, this is what French President Sarkozy was referring to. In fairness to what we said. Obama basically comes and gives a speech about wouldn't it be nice if the world did not have any nuclear weapons. Yes, it would. He basically said this is almost an alternative universe. It's as if nuclear weapons could be banished from the face of the earth. They cannot be he said and Sarkozy pointed out, that there are two countries he said, that’s in the meeting in which the president was in the audience. He said there are two countries right in front of us doing the exact opposite, referring of course to North Korea and Iran, an Iran that had ignored five U.N. resolutions on this issue alone. In the later diplomatic push, vis-avis Iran and North Korea: that yielded nothing. Sarkozy said we are right to talk about the future as the president was referring, but we also have to worry about the present and here you have these two countries, members of the United Nations who are pursuing exactly the policies that we find inimical. We’ve got to find some way to deal with the present he said and not with the future. In fact he pointed to the President -- looked at the President and said, this is not the real world that you are talking about; this is the virtual world. Now this is in the full presence of many leaders of the United Nations in the audience and the French President says to an American President, you have to admit that the world is upside down when the French President sounds much stronger than the American one. And this is what it seems to me is what we have to address here. Now, it is, I can add to those things you’ve heard the references to when Obama withdrew the promises of ABM defenses, two countries in Central Europe, perhaps thinking that he might appease Russia into abrogating their patronage of Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Well frankly this has obviously failed and now in Central Europe, there is a fear that the United States may no longer be a reliable guarantor of their security. My time is up -- Well let me just, if I may just close. I just want to say one thing about this. What we are talking about here is an ability to play the game and an understand of how to play to the game and play the game well and effectively. That is what I see us lacking in the Obama administration and why it makes me feel that we are on the decline."

    "data":"Yes, absolutely against for sure. In this debate I will have a big handicap and a little advantage. The big handicap is unfortunately my terrible and pitiful English. I must apologize. And my little advantage is to look at this topic, at this motion from outside and maybe from a slightly objective point of view. When you speak about Obama’s foreign policy spelling America’s decline, what do people think? Number one, they speak about the weakness, the supposed weakness of Barack Obama, his practice of compromise, his taste for compromise and so on. I think it is not true. I think that Obama, as I see him from outside, tries to compromise, does -- makes the most he can do with compromise and when it does not work, for example, when Syria proves to be continuing to bring some heavy weapons to a fascist party which is Hezbollah, then sanctions in strength. Barack Obama, as did any of your last presidents, believes in strengths but he believes in strengths as the great strategies, as Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, holding the fire and not this zero degree of strengths which is just Jacksonian politics. The second thing which is meant when one speaks about Barack Obama spelling the decline of America alludes to the fact that Obama would not be supportive enough to his natural allies and too much supportive for his enemies. I don’t think so at all. I just believe that he does what the foreign policy must do. Foreign policy by definition speaks with enemies, speaks with ugly leaders, and in the respect of the natural alliance. I happen to be one of the Europeans who have had the chance to speak with Barack Obama about Israel six years ago before he was even candidate. My feeling again from outside is that to say that Barack Obama would not be supportive enough to the old natural allies of America is just untrue. Number three: the reproach, which is criticized, which is done to Barack Obama is that he speaks a lot and acts not enough. I'm not sure that he acts so little. I have one personal experience, rather recent, in Afghanistan. I was in the Uzbin Valley with some of your guys embedded in an American unit. I saw that the strategy of General McChrystal endorsed by your president is not so bad and is producing some real results on the ground. But this be put aside, it is true the Barack Obama speaks, speaks a lot, but why does he speak so much? He speaks because he knows that foreign policy has changed its stage, that the new stage of foreign policy has new actors. And especially one new actor: not only the, not only Sarkozy, not only the big leader of the world or the little leaders of the world, but the public opinion. Barack Obama understood that to have a real foreign policy supposes to address directly the world public opinion, that it is the only chance to achieve some real results as he did, for example, with the speech of Cairo. The other criticism which is done to Barack Obama is to admit too easily the rise of new powers and the subsequent diminution of the American influence: power of Russia, power of China, and so on. But again, who is really spelling the decline? Those who still believe in the world of yesterday, frozen in old schemes, or those who try to understand the world which is coming with a new lens, with new glasses, and trying to maintain the rank of America in this new world? Barack Obama just knows that China is becoming a big power. He just knows that Russia is an actor de-freezing itself from the old Stalinist era. He knows that he has to deal with that and he does. And the last reproach which is done to him is about exceptionalism. I read that Barack Obama is getting rid of this old American creed which is exceptionalism. And why? Because he apologized for Abu Ghraib, for Guantanamo, for torture, and so on. I believe the contrary. I believe that only dictators never apologize. And I believe that when you apologize, it means that you believe in your creed, that you believe in your values, and you believe in their superiority. Barack Obama more than ever believes in the house shining on the hill and that's why I vote no on the motion, he does not spell American decline."

    "data":"So thank you very much, John. And it's an honor for Rich and I to appear even in a debate with two such distinguished colleagues. But I want to warn you at the outset that this is a bit of a mismatch. Rich and I are academics and think tank types. Nick and Nigel are two of the most effective public advocates we've seen in recent times. Nick is one of my colleagues and friends at Harvard, our offices are about 20 feet apart. I introduce him as often as I can to Harvard audiences because I would prefer him to speak than me. And always I say, which is what I truly believe, that the U.S. has had no more effective public spokesman in modern times than Nick Burns when he was assistant secretary for public affairs. Nigel is a legend -- Nigel is a legend in Washington as the British ambassador to the U.S., who is an extremely, again, effective public spokesman. So as you listen to the discussion tonight, I hope you'll think about the evidence and the analysis presented and not the eloquence because if -- if that was the case, you can vote now and be done. So the motion is about a dog in the fight. Let me just ask, how many people here have a dog? Okay. So I just want to see if it's a dog friendly audience. I think Aspen is usually fairly dog friendly. So as you think about the argument tonight, consider this, you go around a corner, you confront dogs in a fight, and you think what to do. And compare that with a second case in which you're confronting a dog fight in which one dog has its mouth around the other's throat and you discover that it's your dog. Now, the question is, Is this America's dog in this fight? So as the moderator reminded us, this assignment tonight is not whether the U.S. should care about the dogs that are tearing each other apart in Syria tonight. It's tragic and anybody who looks at it without having their heart torn ought to have a -- you know, an MRI to see if their heart's turned to stone. The question is, How much should we care and what should we do about it? So in the language of national security, the question is, Does what's happening in Syria so impact American vital national interests that we're compelled to do everything we can including military actions to secure our interests? That's what it is to have a vital national interest. And, secondly, if the answer to that is, Yes, or even if you're a little shaky on that one, Has anybody been able to identify a feasible American military intervention that would likely make the situation better over the long run than -- after we had acted than in the case we did not act? So if you think about this be clear and let me be as unambiguous as we can. Our answer to these questions -- these two questions are no and no. No, the U.S. does not have a vital national interest in what's happening in Syria, and two, no. No one, is at least to my satisfaction, or Rich's or indeed to Chairman Dempsey, chairman of the JCS, identified a feasible American military intervention, which after the fact would likely make the situation over time better than the alternative. So, it's to our opponents, I think, to explain how and why they disagree with these judgments, and suggest to us what evidence leads them to that conclusion. In these opening comments, I'm going to just make some general comments -- general big points, big picture, that bear on the question you have in front of you, and then my colleague, Rich, is going to drill down in more detail. Four quick points. First, Sam Nunn who is a member of the Aspen Strategy Group, which we're all here as part of, insists that we draw the distinction between vivid and vital. Because he says whenever something is vivid, especially if it appears on TV over and over and people are being killed, Americans, or many Americans, imagine well, we must have a vital interest there because it's impacting our interests and since we're the world's greatest military super power, maybe there's a military intervention we could undertake to make things better. In our view, that's not the case here. This is a vivid, painful, but not vital. Vital in the dictionary, read it, says essential for survival and well-being. In the mantra of national security it says essential for the preservation of the U.S. as a free society with our fundamental institutions and values intact. Syria does not meet that test. Now some of you are saying well, maybe that's too high a test. I mean, could anything threaten our vital interest? And I would say in 1990, when Saddam tried to annex Kuwait and threatened the whole possibility of the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf, President Bush, the father, chose military action and that was the right choice.

    "data":"John, thank you very much. Good afternoon everyone. It's a pleasure to be here. Pleasure for Nigel and I to be with Richard and Graham. They're both good friends. I won't try to butter them up anymore. I need my time, but I will say this. We've been asked to address one question. Does the United States of America have a dog in the fight in Syria? The question wasn't whether it's vital. The question wasn't whether it's feasible. Do we have an interest in who wins in this fight in Syria? And the answer is unequivocally of course, yes, without any question. Because Americans should be supporting the Syrian people who have been brutalized by the Syrian dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad. And we should oppose the Assad regime because it's being supported by Iran and Hezbollah and Russia. So that's the dog in the fight for the United States. And what happens in Syria really matters to our country for our national security. I would say it matters to every American. Let me give you three reasons why. First, there's a humanitarian imperative. I think everybody knows what's been happening. There's a catastrophic humanitarian situation in Syria. More than 100,000 Syrians have been killed in the last two and a half years, all civilians, 1.8 million Syrian refugees outside the country in Iraq and Turkey and in Jordan in refugee camps, 6.8 million people in need of humanitarian support and of those people, 4.5 million have lost their home in Syria. They're on the roads. They're trying to find a place to live. They've lost their jobs. Secretary of State -- former Secretary of State Madeline Albright is here. And she and I were in Morocco a couple of months ago. We met with the U.N. Envoy for Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi. He told us something I don't think -- I won't forget. It was very arresting. He said, “Syria is melting away because of this humanitarian crisis.” So, do we have a dog in the fight? We want to help the Syrian people who have been brutalized by their own regime. That's the first reason. The second reason is geography. Look at the map. Syria is a neighbor to very important friends and allies of the United States. It's a neighbor to Israel. It's a neighbor to Turkey, to Iraq, to Jordan, and to Lebanon. So, its central strategic position in the Levant, in the heart of the Middle East, in the heart of the Arab world -- it means that what happens there really matters to the United States and especially to our ally, Israel. And third, Syria matters to the United States because who is arming and aiding and financing this regime? It's our enemy, Iran. And its partner Hezbollah. And it's our adversary, Russia. So, if Assad wins, Iran and Hezbollah become infinitely stronger. And that puts Israel, the United States, and all of our moderate Arab friends at a distinct strategic disadvantage. Do we have a dog in this fight? You better believe we have a dog in this fight. Nigel and I support what President Obama has been trying to do, what the United Kingdom government has been trying to do, the coalition of countries: the United States, the European countries, Turkey, nearly all the Arab countries, supported by Israel -- who all want to see the following happen -- no one wants to put American troops on the ground in Syria. President Obama has said resolutely he won’t do that. But this coalition is trying to do the following. They're trying to launch an intensified international effort. It has been too weak so far. It needs to be strengthened to support the moderate rebels and the majority of the Syrian population who support the rebel movement. They're trying to organize more effective humanitarian aid. We the Americans have given a lot. Others need to do more. But it needs to get to the refugees. This group is trying to illuminate -- for international judgment and inspection -- Assad's war crimes, his brutalization of his own people and his use of chemical weapons. And this coalition as well, is seeking now to build a transitional government -- formed by the rebel movement -- that would be a government that can compete with the Assad regime for political support through which we can give humanitarian aid. And President Obama's former Syria coordinator, Fred Hoff, testified before Congress on July 17th that that should be now the central objective of this coalition. They want to support a political process that eventually -- over time -- and it's going to take a long time -- to make sure that Assad can leave, that a new and more stable transitional government can take his place. It won't be perfect. They'll go through all sorts of ups and downs and frustrations. But at the end of the day -- and maybe it's a year or two or three from now -- there's a better, more humane government in power in Damascus. What are the advantages to what President Obama is trying to do? It helps the refugees. It supports the great majority of the population in Syria who are opposed to Assad. It has wide international support. It opposes Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia. It has America leading -- but politically, keeping our troops out of harm's way. This is going to be difficult. It's going to be enormously complex. I think we'll see a lot of setbacks. It is not -- and I'm sure Graham or Richard will point this out -- without its risks. But there is a greater risk of inaction. "

    "data":"Thank you, John. I must just start by saying, this is an immensely difficult and tragic problem. And it's very hard to take clear positions when something is so difficult and hard to solve. I will say, however, that there are some things that divide the two sides of the debate. And one, as my colleague Graham said, is really what it means to have a dog in the fight. And we stand for a view which says it means you have a vital and national interest at stake which makes it so compelling that you lead and do whatever is necessary to make sure that your vital interests are protected. And we don't think that exists in Syria. Graham made the case in summary for us. There are many things that we are doing as a country, that we could do, that we should do. We heard some of those from Nick. We may hear some more from Nigel. But the real question before us is is the interest engaged in Syria so vital that we must lead and be centrally involved and possibly intervene militarily to remove Assad from power? And we think the answer to that, unfortunately, is no. Graham made the argument in summary. I want to elaborate it in three ways. First, to give you a little bit of ground truth about this conflict. Second, talk about chemical weapons. And third, the issue of supplying light arms.  On the ground truth in the conflict -- this is not a simple conflict of good versus evil, though Assad certainly is evil. And it is not a single conflict. This is many different conflicts. And frankly, a fatal flaw in Nick and Nigel's position here is there is no opposition for us to support. You'd think that if you had a dog in the fight, you could at least have a name for the dog on the other side. But it's not good enough to say the Syrian people or the Syrian opposition, because the fact is, there is no unified opposition.  And there is no connection between the mostly exile-based political leadership and the fighters on the ground. I -- we're so draconian on time. I can't really go through all the different factions of Syrian fighters and political entities at the moment. But there's the Syrian Free Army, the Syrian Liberation Front, the Syrian Islamic Front, the Al-Nusra Front, various Kurdish groups, independent groups -- all of whom are, in fact, umbrella groups of smaller numbers of fighters out there in the field running their own operations. And in that context, we -- there are also organizers, The National Coalition, who are mostly outside of the country, not connected to the fighters on the inside, and not able to dictate what happens on the ground. And so, this is a real problem. If you want to have a dog in the fight, to not have the slightest idea who it is, and to hope that it will come together. And in fact, the most effective and vicious and aggressive fighters in this conflict are ones with whom we would never side.  The one -- the last one I mentioned was the Al-Nusra front. This is a wing of Al-Qaeda. It has sworn allegiance to Ayman Zawahiri. So, yes, we -- now, so we have -- we really have two dilemmas in Syria. We've got Assad aligned with Hezbollah, a Shi'ite extremist terrorist group. And the most effective and operationally effective opposition group being one who is completely anathema to us to the point that we've designated them a foreign terrorist organization. So, how can you have a dog in the fight when you can't even identify the dog? Second, on chemical weapons -- Assad has a massive chemical weapons arsenal -- comprised primarily of nerve gas -- sarin, DX, and mustard gas. Can't go into the details of what it is, where it is. It's not in a condition that can be easily and quickly used, but it is very dangerous. One of the dilemmas we face here is that it is currently controlled by the Assad regime and the Alawite sect. And we do have -- maybe a vital interest -- certainly a very strong interest in ensuring these weapons are not transferred to Hezbollah and they are not used against Israel, Turkey, our allies in the Gulf, our own forces. And unfortunately, this is actually a sort of restraint on our power. Most of the more aggressive forms of intervention and keeping the military balance in the favor of the rebels will lead -- at least temporarily -- to a loss -- a higher risk of loss of control of the chemical weapons. We cannot forget that. Finally, on -- and I want to say something about what I'd call the moral hazard of half-measures. We have -- as an unfortunate leitmotif in American foreign policy -- which is every so often, we give support and comfort to groups with which to rise up against an autocrat. And then we get cold feet and leave them dangling. And we did that in Hungary in 1956. We did it in the Bay of Pigs in '61, in Prague in 1968, in southern Iraq in 1991. And we need to be very careful about small half measures in steps which are -- really have no prospect of success but do make us complicit in the violent outcome which we really cannot control and cannot dictate. And so for that reason it strikes me as that, yes, of course, we should stay involved and engaged diplomatically, and politically there is room for that, but to begin a process of arming a number of rebel groups we can't even control, and don't know, and, frankly, don't trust, I think, is a very dangerous first step since we really are not ready to go the distance. And, in fact, very few people, and certainly none of them on this panel I think, are truly ready to go the distance, which, by the way, we all would be if it were a vital national interest. And that's the essence of the problem here. We want to make it better but it really is not so vital to allow us to be ready to do everything it takes to get the outcome that would be better for us and the region. Thank you. "

    "data":"Well, thank you very much, John, and my thanks to Intelligence Squared for initiating an important debate. And it's a great honor for me to be here with my three distinguished fellow panelists. Now, I just want to go back to the motion. I'm a Brit, and I think I know something about the English language. And to me having no dog in the fight in Syria means something very simple. It means that you don't -- you're not concerned. You don't have an interest, and you won't be affected by the outcome. That's my dictionary definition, and I think if you look it up, that's what you'll find. I agree that the other side want to do something in Syria. The question is, How important is this issue? How much does it affect American interests, European interests, world interests, and is there some sensible way through in a world where things are much more complicated than they were in 1990 when we had the Kuwait conflict, where we have to deal in gray as much as in black and white, and where we risk paralysis if we don't try to do something rather than be paralyzed. So my suggestion would be that the United States does indeed have a strategic interest in what happens in Syria. I don't know that I can meet the very high bar that Graham and our other colleague have mentioned in relation to an American intervention, whether this is important or not. And the proposers of this motion do want America to stand back. I would say that in today's world you're dealing with complex changes within countries, you're dealing with situations of extremism, instability, you're dealing with a humanitarian tragedy here in Syria, and you have to work out whether there's some recipe which has a reasonable chance of success. And the best need not be the enemy of the good in deciding that. I don't think, too, that we can wait for the perfect opposition party, some Jeffersonian democratic ideal to be formed in Syria. We don't have perfect opposition parties in our own countries, let alone in Syria or elsewhere in the Middle East. We've got to go with the situation on the ground in the Middle East at the moment, where there is a huge amount of uncertainty, and we have to decide whether we understand that dictators like Assad will at some point or other be swept away. And whether we’re prepared just to sit it out, and do very little to achieve a much better outcome. As Nick said earlier, the status quo really isn’t sustainable for the United States, for Britain, and for our other allies, and that’s where I really part company with Graham and with Richard. If Assad stays in power, Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah are going to win. The vast majority of the Syrian population are going to be in revolt. The longer this goes on the conflict in Syria is going to spill over into the rest of the region. The split between the Sunni and the Shia within Islam is going to expand. And speaking certainly for my country, we've seen a radicalization of our Muslim population because of Syria. It's become a recruiting sergeant for radicals around the world. And those young men and perhaps women are going to go to Syria and pick up a whole load of skills in violence and in terrorism, which will be re-imported into our own countries and threaten us very directly. And I think that's a real risk for the U.K., for the U.S., and for others. I spent nearly 36 years in the British diplomatic service. I believe in the transatlantic partnership. I think that there's little good that happens in the world if Europe and America are not standing together. And I and my compatriots are friends of this country. But I do worry about America's credibility and standing if we just sit this one out. President Obama talked last year about red lines and a game changer if Syria were found to have used chemical weapons. We now know that chemical weapons were used by the Assad regime in the conflict. This administration, my government, many other governments have said unequivocally over the months that Assad must go. So what happens if he stays? Is that without any consequence? At the very least Iran is going to be watching and is going to draw a conclusion about American resolve and determination. Russia and China will be watching. If this audience wants to sustain American leadership of a new kind after the difficult decade that we've had, then I think we need an active, concerted, comprehensive policy in Syria, and not be defeated by the fear that anything we do will suck us in militarily. And as Nick has said, that does not need to happen. We've got a program which addresses the humanitarian problem, which accepts that this opposition is not perfect, but there is a national coalition which has formed, which -- with which the U.S. government recognizes as the alternative government of Syria, which the European governments and Arab League governments see in that role as well. And there are still moderate rebel forces in the form of the Free Syria -- channel arms through as a way of changing the situation on the ground, which is what we've got to do. Assad will not move by himself. It will require persistent determined pressure over a range of areas, diplomatic, humanitarian, and then with these limited arms supplies from the United States and indeed from other Arab countries. So to my mind that is a dog in the fight. That's a strategic stake for the United States and for Britain and we've got to support this trend in the Arab world and we've got to support the Syrian people. "

    "data":"Thank you. And I want to say, it's great to be back in New York City. I was a resident here for four years, and I think it's one of the two most scrappy and resilient places in America. I won't say what the other one is, but you can probably guess. I also have to say that although our topic tonight is drones, I think in the back of our mind, we know that our nation is having a very important debate about Syria. And I just want to say I'm grateful that we the people are leading our government on that issue, and at least we're pausing for a while, perhaps, before a decision is made.  The issue at hand is the motion that Ahmed and I are going to spend seven minutes each -- as well as the rest of the evening, of course -- we believe strongly that the program is fatally flawed. Ahmed will cover some of the issues that I won't. We've divided the labor as follows: he's going to look at lot of the legality questions. He'll look at -- from his perspective in Pakistan and all the great books he's written -- how much recruiting has actually increased. And contrary to, I think, some of the conventional wisdom, how effective and how targeted some of these drone strikes are. My points are going to be based on having lived in interesting places like Fallujah, Khost, Helmand . I view my role tonight as being the ambassador for the people that don't get a voice on this debate, which are really the Afghans and the Pakistanis -- most of the people I sat across a table from and heard the stories after the drones launched the hellfire missiles. So, if I do that well enough, hopefully you'll get some of their voices, which is what motivated me mostly in this debate, is to not speak as a former State Department official, but to actually speak for the people. So, it's not a headquarters perspective. It's not a State Department official perspective. It's their perspective.  One thing left out of my bio was that my mother is a fifth-grade schoolteacher, so if you'll bear with me, I'm going to ask you to do a couple things she taught me. I've got about 30 seconds to ask you for this, so, the first is show and tell, and the second is a pop quiz. I'm going to start with the show and tell because -- I think it reinforces, again, what's lost in the drone debate too often. This is a pakol, which is a wool cap that basically, the more rural parts of Afghanistan, you'll see the tribal people wearing. Again, I'm trying to give voice to these guys, some of my friends. It's a wool cap that kind of looks like -- I don't know how I'd explain it, but it's a pretty cool cap that's round and rolled up at the bottom. The - Worn by Afghans in the tribal regions. This sparkly cap is called a kandahari, which is what I consider the next generation of leaders that you'll see wearing a lot. And again, if we're listening to them, what they tell us is basically that the drone program is undercutting them and undercutting their future. And then finally -- and I'll be quick -- I think I'm speaking on behalf of the front-line troops, because contrary, again, to conventional wisdom, this Kevlar helmet -- which is a Marine helmet -- I think represents those of us who dodge more IEDs and dodge more bombs when these drone strikes actually don't hit their target. Okay. The quiz. If you could pull out a piece of paper, my mom will be proud. Or if you can take some mental notes -- I'm going to ask you two questions, and I think they're important questions, and they're relevant. The first is, after 12 years of constant warfare, which really started in the scarred city of New York with Lower Manhattan, what words or adjectives do you think Afghans or Iraqis or Yemenis associate with the United States of America? Nouns, adjectives, whatever comes to mind. And then secondly, what words would you associate with our nation, the United States of America, after 12 years of basically constant warfare? Second question is, why is May 1, 2010, relevant to this debate? Don't Google it. Don't use your iPhones. But if you happen to -- if that rings a bell with you, we'll come back to it. The two case studies I'm now going to focus on in about the -- half of the time I've got left are one from Iraq, Fallujah, and a couple basically from Afghanistan. In 2004, drones were not armed. They were eyes in the sky. When drones became a fatally flawed program is really the X that I'm trying to hit here. The Fallujans would look up, they'd hear a flying lawnmower. The women would hang their clothes and get awkward and uncomfortable. The city leaders would come into our meetings and be irritated, but they weren't yet strategically against us. And, of course, this is the site of the largest battle of the Iraq war. When did they become fatally flawed, and who did they become fatal to? I will argue, and Ahmed will argue as well they became fatal to civilians, more than a few. And they became fatal, I believe, to all of us. In Afghanistan, in early 2009, marine general Larry Nicholson and I were in a place called Tagaz, which is basically the southern reaches of our area of operation. We met a bunch of Marines who were alone and unafraid at the edge of the American military empire, overstretched. We all know the story. The next day, in the same location, a suicide bomber blew himself up, killed two marines and killed a corpsman. If anyone wanted revenge, I did. If anyone wanted revenge, General Larry Nicholson did. If anyone wanted revenge, the United States Marine Corps did. Within a few days, we identified some suspicious looking guys who were near the area from above. Two drone strikes landed a couple hellfire missiles. One of the men was killed right away. The other one was split in two. And we all watched as he tried to drag himself into the hole from the first strike. He couldn't hide. He bled out. He died. Was it a good guy? Absolutely not. But was he found out to be directly tied to the attack? No. That happens more than we'd like to admit. The next example is based on a New York Times article that just came out on Sunday. You may have read it, but I wanted to be as topical and as recent as I could. Reportedly 14 Afghans were killed. So I asked a friend of mine, who lives in Kunar, what he was hearing. And he quoted a villager who said this: May Allah give me power for one day to use a single drone on the American people so that the American politicians understand how much it pains when a missile comes from the sky and kills your relatives in front of your eyes, and you can't revenge them any more. I've got another quote, but I don't have time to get there. In closing, I found a very convincing op-ed by a very senior former member of our government, highly experienced, wrote it brilliantly, brilliant perspective. And it was titled, Drones alone are not the answer.” And it was a New York Times op-ed that came out on August 14th, 2011. He said, the important question today is whether continued unilateral drone attacks will substantially reduce al-Qaeda's capabilities. They will not.” And I am pleased that he is on stage with us. It's Admiral Blair. And I look forward to hearing more comments based on the argument he made in the New York Times. So I'm out of time, but thank you. "

    "data":"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and our fellow debaters. On behalf of Admiral Blair, it's a privilege to be here to address with you a very, very important topic. And, Kael, I would argue that I'm representing the troops in the field tonight. And we can talk about the relative advantages. But I think it's important also to address the issue Kael mentioned of the strike on Sunday. It's important to know that that strike killed the individual who publicly admitted to kidnapping Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl of the United States Army who was still the only American service person who is incarcerated in Afghanistan today. Now, it may be that others were also injured and/or killed in this event. But I would argue that Afghanistan is a declared combat zone, ladies and gentlemen. And under the rules of armed conflict, that this individual was a legitimate target and clearly a combatant. And he will kidnap no more American servicemen. But let me go back to a bit more balanced discussion. What I want to do tonight -- and I submit, ladies and gentlemen, that the employment of U.S. strike-capable systems is a viable and a rational response to a vexing battlefield problem, one that must be calibrated, used with care, synced withpolicy. But nonetheless, one that allows us to pursue our objectives in a fashion that minimizes loss of life for friendly forces and maximizes the opportunity to avoid needless casualties of friendlies; in other words, collateral damage. Simply remotely piloted aircraft, or drones, permit more considered and more accurate and, as a result, more proportionate application of lethal force than any other comparable weapon system. Because they can spend longer time over the target than equivalent manned aircraft, they give their operators the time to maximize the certainty but not necessarily achieve absolute certainty that they are engaging the right enemy combatants and that they have the time and the means to confirm the presence of noncombatants in the presence of the intended target. Thoughtful observers like our partners tonight have mentioned a number of criticisms. Let me talk quickly about a couple of them. One is that the absence of physical risk to the operator encourages our political leadership to use remote systems more often than they would if they had to put American troops in harm's way. I would counter by asking whether those who use this argument would prefer for the American military to absorb casualties just for the purpose of making war less numbing to the political leadership. In addition -- that's a tactical level -- is the ability of remote systems to maintain surveillance of target areas with remote operators carefully and deliberately evaluating potential targets against the criteria that allows them to shoot, that makes this system so discriminating and effective. Soldiers and airmen under fire on the ground I think you would agree, Kael, are far more likely to shoot back at the sources of fire aimed against them, with greater danger to noncombatants than are remote operators whose safety and lives are not at immediate risk. There's also a concern that nonstate or state actors will use these technologies against us in a more crude and indiscriminate fashion than do we. And well, they might. But the reality is is that this technology is proliferating, and not because we chose to use it. It is a fact of technology advancing. And our lead was and remains significant. So, let me go to a quick summary of some data. This goes back to 2011 in Afghanistan during the surge period. There are about 150,000 Air Force flights in Afghanistan in 2011. Sadly, about 3,000 of those flights were medical evacuation sorties of our wounded, and our dead. Compare that total to 25,000 close air support sorties and support of ground forces, your Marines, of which 1,400 had at least one weapon release. So what this means is, is out of 25,000 sorties, 1,400 actually released a weapon. There were many sorties that flew with no weapon release at all. That's what a professional Air Force does. Ready, finger on the trigger, but extremely careful and deliberate about applying lethal force in practice and in principle. 333 of those 400 weapon releases were by remote systems. Now, I ask you, were those releases -- the three quarters of the releases -- from manned aircraft somehow more practical, less immoral, less unfair than those 25 percent that were released by unmanned aircraft? I think not. "

    "data":"The first thing I think to make clear is that unfortunately drones -- which is -- it's a weapon, it's a tool, it's a tactic -- has almost become a strategy in itself, and this is how foreign governments and countries where drones are being used see it. All the good of U.S. foreign policy, aid, foreign aid, training of security forces, bank loans, et cetera, et cetera, all are demolished when at the same time the U.S. uses drones. So in fact drones are undermining U.S. foreign policy. They become the only symbol of foreign policy which people abroad remember when they are -- when those countries in particular are targeted. And some of the countries like Yemen, like Pakistan are in fact allies of the United States and drones are being used against allies, naturally that is infuriating the population even more. Secondly, how badly have drones affected the counterterrorism strategy, the much more sophisticated strategy that has emerged from the U.S. in the last few years, where the whole strategy is made to protect population, to provide economic incentive, development, et cetera. Again, here we see the counterterrorism strategy being undermined completely by drones because the people are very scared of them, and they do take out civilian targets just as much as they take out al-Qaeda. The other question which I think has to be agitating the minds of many Americans is how legal is this? How legal is it to bomb and kill individuals in another country with which you are not at war, with which nothing has been disclosed, there's no transparency involved, nobody is informed as to why and how these people are being killed, and often this is, again, taking place in countries, you know, that are allies of the U.S. The lack of transparency is not helped by the fact that the CIA has been mostly involved in using drones, especially in Pakistan. If -- and certainly there's a move now to move some of these drone attacks to the defense department, but -- and that could increase transparency, but at the moment the CIA's running it and nobody knows how these targets are chosen or whether killing these individuals are justified or not. Now, what all this is leading to is an enormous buildup of hatred for the United States, and that is not just affecting people in the target countries but people all over the Muslim world in particular. It's quite shocking to see the figures in Pakistan. One poll puts 74 percent of Pakistanis now hate the U.S. more than India, and remember, Pakistan has fought three wars against India, and India is the proverbial enemy. Another poll that I just read recently in Chicago, yesterday, put it at 94 percent. And here, as I sit, we're talking about a so-called ally of the United States. Now, what should also be worrying is the precedent that is being set. What happens when another country will start using drones? First of all, what happens if a European country, or Russia, or a so-called ally of the United States uses drones? What is the U.S. strategy going to be? How is that going to affect U.S. foreign policy? Are you going to slap that country down? Are you going to tell that country to behave itself and say, No, only we have the right to kill people in other countries. You don't have that right. Even more dangerous, what happens when an enemy of the United States uses drones? What happens if North Korea, tomorrow, uses drones to kill South Koreans? What happens if Al-Qaeda itself develops drones? What happens if any -- if the Syrians or any of the problematic regimes, dictatorships, start using drones? So, what will be the U.S. policy then? Are you going to go and bomb those countries? What is the U.S. strategy policy going to be? There's a complete vacuum here. There's no thought being given to this. But this could happen tomorrow. Drones now are everywhere. Drones are being used for all sorts of other, peaceful projects. And any of those drones can be bought on the market and they could be converted into drones that kill people. And I think that the idea that somehow, the U.S. is going to have a monopoly over this instrument forever is very short-sighted. I think the other thing that is -- that I must answer, the issue of civilian casualties. There is, for example, a drone strategy now, where drones fire what are called signature strikes. That is if a bunch of militants are seen or one or two militants are seen in a group of civilians, or sitting in a bus or sitting in a truck, or something like that, drones are used -- can be used to kill that militant. But of course, they kill everyone else in the truck, too. Women, children, men, civilians. Now, the last drone strike, actually, on Sunday, was not the one that the general mentioned, but was one in which 16 civilians were killed. And President Karzai just complained to the Americans. And they were killed by a drone, because there were a couple of militant guys in the midst of these people. I think they were in a bus or a truck or something like that. So, the fact is -- I mean, the issue of civilian casualties is very controversial. The Americans do not tell us what -- you know, how many civilians have been killed. But estimates from other groups put the casualties in Pakistan alone somewhere between 500 and 1,000. I mean, that's the level of inaccuracy that we have, because we really don't know. These areas are inaccessible or -- and the people who would know, certainly, by watching the video screen, the drone firer, that kind of information is available. And lastly, I think we have to understand how drones have been a recruiting poster for Al-Qaeda and global jihad. Even local groups -- local militant groups in countries which have nothing to do with Al-Qaeda, nothing to do with global jihad -- if they have been droned, they become global jihadists. They want to strike back at America. They want to kill Americans. And that is really what is very dangerous, that more and more groups who are really fighting local wars and conflicts are becoming militarized and wanting to strike back at the United States and those other countries.

    "data":"Gen. Schwartz addressed the use of drones in a battlefield area with U.S. troops deployed. I'm going to talk about the more controversial program, in which we use drones in areas in which we do not have our troops in action. And Pakistan, of course, is the primary example that comes to mind. In fact, probably our motion tonight, U.S. drone program is fatally flawed, is shorthand for the American drones in Pakistan have been a failure. And you've heard from Mr. Rashid some of the objections to that. I would tell you that there in fact is no independent drone program. The drones are part of a wider strategy which is dedicated to ending the threat from al-Qaeda, a threat with which this city is very, very familiar. The policy of the drones, a tactic to an end, are to take care of the hard core leaders and fighters who are not persuadable, who are not going to change their demonstrated and committed intention to kill as many Americans as they can before they -- before they can accomplish that. The -- a conflict between a country, the United States, and a non-state group like al-Qaeda, is allowed under international humanitarian law. And that's what we are involved in. It began here almost 12 years ago, 12 years ago tomorrow. It has continued with al-Qaeda's affiliates. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula sent a bomber to try to kill a bunch of Americans in an airplane over Detroit. TTP, Tehrik-i-Taliban in Pakistan, sent Faisal Shahzad a few blocks south of here to Times Square to kill a bunch of innocent Americans if he could. We are at war with this group. And the leadership of these organizations holed up in places like northwest Pakistan and Yemen, places where the governments of our allies, as Mr. Rashid said, do not control their territory. It's worse in Pakistan. They not only do not control their territory. They give permission to the United States to take action where they cannot, and then they blame us for doing it, which accounts for a great deal of the sentiment in Pakistan when a dissembling hypocritical policy of Pakistani politicians allows them to blame us for actions which they themselves permit. But they could stop us from doing it any time. And the government in Yemen, by way of contrast, openly cooperates with us and tells its people that it does. Now, the drones have been successful. We have killed most of the people who planned, who directed, and then who gloated over the felling of the Twin Towers, the attack on the Pentagon and the aborted attack that ended in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.And we have done that not only with drones, but by armed raids, as we saw in Pakistan, by a lot of cooperation with other countries and a lot of hard intelligence. So drones have played a key role in a successful, but I would argue first phase, of our overall campaign against al-Qaeda. But what about the next phase? I think the role of drones in the next phase should be much different, not because the program has been a failure, but because the situation has changed, and the drones and other tactics have been successes. Now the job is to reduce al-Qaeda from a small-scale threat, which is where it now is, to a nuisance. And to do that, we have to undercut support for al-Qaeda. We have to make sure that Muslim mothers and fathers don't think it's a good idea to send their sons and daughters to strap on suicide vests and to kill innocent people around the world. Al-Qaeda is doing a wonderful job against itself. It has killed far more Pakistanis, far more Muslims than it has Americans and Europeans. But we need to help it further along. And we must do that by becoming even more selective, even more discriminating, even more careful in our use of weapons like drones in the future. And the great bulk of our efforts must be dedicated to helping countries like Pakistan, like Yemen, like Mali, like the southern Philippines, like Somalia, like Libya, like Afghanistan, to make their lives better for their people so that they do not support those who attack the United States and their own governments and others. And this means that we need to continue to work with them. We need to train their security forces to do their jobs to provide security, to do it humanely, respecting the rights of the people. More than that, we need to help them provide economic opportunity, security, dignity, in the words of the Arab Spring. There will be a role for drones in that next phase of this -- of this long-term combat against al-Qaeda. But it will be a more limited, more discriminating role. And the policy in the past certainly has not been a failure, and it must adapt to be a success in the future. And it's only through a campaign like this, ladies and gentlemen, that I believe that we can turn al-Qaeda into just one more in a long line of terrorist groups that flared up, guttered, and then died, which is where it belongs. Thank you. "

    "data":"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on October 10, 1971, the United Nations admitted the People's Republic of China as a member and kicked out Taiwan. If that were the kind of motion we were debating tonight, I would not be standing here arguing in favor. What we are proposing is to admit Palestine at the U.N. not instead of Israel but alongside Israel, unfinished U.N. business from the middle of the last century. Let me first clear up what I hope will not become debris in the way of constructive debate tonight. We have not convened here to discuss matters of legal principle, Does Palestine meet the criteria of Montevideo for statehood? Law matters, but this is primarily a political, not a legal question. And it's not about the United Nations and whether it is a force for good or a frustrating institution. It can be both, and Israel of course went to the U.N. to get its own birth certificate endorsed. But the assumption of this debate is the two-state paradigm. We do not have anyone here advocating a greater Jewish Israel or a binational democratic state, nevertheless, it would be hubris to take two states for granted, and we need to recognize certain realities. The territorial viability of a second state in this area looks increasingly precarious. Approximately 600,000 Israelis, one in 10 Israeli Jews live beyond the green line. Settlements grow. Outposts are legalized. I invite you to go and see the reality. And it's not just a physical manifestation of blurring. It is also the conceptual universe in which a growing number of Israelis live. Prime Minister Netanyahu may have talked the talk on two states, but he has not walked the walk. His own Likud party platform opposes two states, and one must take seriously the Jewish-Israeli narrative that says 100 years ago we had nothing, then we got Balfour, then we got the '47 partition, then we got 78 percent of the land, then in 1967 we got 100 percent of the land, and we're not going anywhere. That's a serious view, and it has an amen corner, by the way, certain people perhaps in New Hampshire tonight's part of that amen corner. Passivity cannot be the response. If we want two states, we have to act. And U.N. admission for Palestine is precisely the anchor for a two-state future, a clarifying moment. We need to be deeply respectful of the choices that Israelis are going to have to make, difficult choices, and the conversations in Israel, and, therefore, to understand just how unproductive the lack of clarity is for that Israeli conversation. Indulging bad behavior, treating that with impunity, is unhelpful in any human predicament. And we encourage the most self destructive tendencies in Israeli behavior when we pretend that by doing nothing, allowing this slippage away from two states, somehow we're making it easier for Israeli society to change course. We are not. The cost benefit calculation of Israelis needs to look different. Do we really think that Israel is waiting to leave the territory, it's just waiting, and the Palestinians just need to ask politely enough and behave well enough, and that's the key to unlock this? Let's acknowledge that it's not going to be easy but the current policies aren't helping. What, then, can be done? The Palestinians do actually have options, violence. I'm against that. That's illegitimate. They can use nonviolence, coercive diplomacy of sanctioning. I can see its legitimacy, but I'm not an advocate of that. Or they can use declarative diplomacy, draw a line, lay down a marker to get the attention of Israelis. That's what U.N. membership is, and I would argue it correlates with what is best, therefore, for Israel. We can't expect the Palestinians to wait forever, and we can't say to them that you can neither have self-determination and express it at the U.N. but nor can you accept the one-state reality and argue for equal rights in one state. Suggesting the Palestinians can do neither is unrealistic, but it's also immoral. So if we want to salvage a two-state solution but at the same time if we can't impose a solution and if we can't even prevent deterioration, if we can't even get a settlement freeze, then how do we give oxygen to this gasping for breath two-state idea? We vote to admit Palestine to the U.N. and we vote for this motion tonight. U.N. membership is not a silver bullet. It’s not a panacea. It’s not sprinkling pixie dust on the harsh realities of the Middle East. But it is an important and legitimate part of a strategy to signal a different future. We will no doubt be told that this can’t happen, that it’s meaningless symbolism, and especially not now with the Arab spring. Wrong. Yes, the U.S. has committed to a veto. No doubt, we’ll discuss that. But does that make this debate pointless? Can the realpolitik argument really close down our entire conversation? If that’s the case, I strongly suggest you guys cancel the debate you have planned in March about banning college football, because it won’t be. And that can always be an argument. I urge the other side of this debate to give us more than naysaying, to give us more than negotiations. Those negotiations are asymmetrical. One side is so lacking in leverage and they are so steeped in years of failure. Negotiations cannot be the singular tool in our toolkit. And finally, if we are concerned about Israel’s security, then let’s acknowledge that hope too is a security currently. Hopelessness encourages violence. There will always be the next mountain range that you need to occupy, but strategic security is about a basket of interests and balances and avoiding casus belli. And perhaps, perhaps, occupation itself contributes to insecurity and Israeli democracy. Eventually managing an occupation and justifying it and sustaining democracy cannot happily coexist. Not to dramatize, but if we don’t have a Palestine, we are saying Kaddish. We are saying the right of prayer, of last prayer for Israeli democracy. I urge you to support this motion, to support the principle of Palestine alongside Israel at the U.N. Thank you. "

    "data":"John, thank you very much. And thank all of you for coming. Daniel, I’ve known you for many years. I admire your passion and your intellect. You’re a powerful advocate of Israeli-Palestinian peace, of logic and common sense. All of this, however, does not address the fundamental problem, the conundrum now, Daniel. We’re dealing with a conundrum. We are stuck. Violence will never produce sovereignty for Palestinians, but neither will negotiations right now. So the question is what to do. What you are suggesting, in my judgment, is that we take an action that is not simply neutral, that will retard and undermine the very concept as dubious as you may believe it is. And Mustafa will agree. Dore may even agree. It is simply no justification for proceeding in the face of common sense logic toward an alternative that ultimately will not bring Palestinians closer to meaningful sovereignty. I speak here not as an Israeli to you and not as a Palestinian. I speak with all its imperfections and contradictions as an American, absorbed in this process for many years, 25 years. And during the course of that period, I developed a faith in three primary assumptions: Number one, there was a solution, equitable and durable; number two, negotiations were the only way to achieve it. And negotiations is flawed and it’s imperfect because it’s based on human frailty and weakness and on the need and the capacity to compromise; and finally, that the United States had a critical role to play in this process by being fair, by being tough and by being reassuring -- all of these assumptions. Any honest man or woman would acknowledge . And the situation, you’re quite correct, Dan, it will be worse. It will get worse before it gets worse. But the question still has to be addressed. How will granting the putative state of Palestine admission as a full-member state into the U.N. address any of this? Now, I’m here to argue in six basic points. I don’t want to bore you. I’m not here to entertain you, but to leave you with perhaps a baker’s dozen in the next four-and-a-half minutes of why I believe this is a bad idea. And, by the way, I concede, particularly to you, Daniel, that I know bad ideas when I see them. I know illusions when I see them. I was responsible, over the course of a 20-year period, for quite a few, as Mustafa will attest, perhaps even Dore. But not tonight. I have no illusions tonight. First, as an American whose country sits on the Security Council, I cannot, in all good conscience, recommend the admission of a putative state however morally or ethically compelling it may be as a full member state. Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, the man who has done more to build institutions of Palestinian statehood on the ground is against this proposition because he knows it'll undermine the work that he has done. It'll undermine the institutions. Palestine has no borders. It has no control over its population. It has no monopoly over the forces of violence within its own society. In short, it does not control the guns, all of the guns in its society. I would argue that's critically important for statehood. Yes, much of this may be due to the Israeli occupation. But that doesn't change the reality. Admission of Palestine now will create a situation in which it cannot discharge its own obligations as a member state, in large part because half of its government, the rival Palestinian national movement doesn't ascribe to a peaceful solution of interstate conflicts. Mustafa may have much to say about this, but this is an obligation of UN membership. Second, as an American, I'd oppose this because I believe it's not symbolic. It's not symbolic at all. It's a prescription, and an RX, if you will, for instability and perhaps even escalation. Think about it. We are admitting the Palestinian authority that presumes to control Palestine into the UN when in fact two other entities, one, the state of Israel, an ally of the United States, and the second factor and force, Hamas, an entity which is an adversary of the United States, has more control over what transpires in Palestine, this putative state than the Palestinian authority. That is a prescription for endless contradictions and perhaps even violence. Mustafa will tell you, and he may be right, that the basis for this negotiation, and the basis of -- for any Palestinian state will be June 4, '67 borders. But admitting Palestine into the UN will mean that a Palestinian president not only has the right and the obligation to defend those borders. I wouldn't want -- I mean, maybe you see this as a blessing. I see it as a huge contradiction, to put any head of a putative state in a position where he has to defend borders that he cannot defend. And what is he to say to his public when the Israelis continue to do what they will do? Which brings me to my third point. There will be an Israeli reaction. And who is going to control that reaction? The United States? The international community? As Israel seeks perhaps to set its own boundaries, to basically say to the Palestinians, fine, you have now set your boundaries. June 4, '67, is the basis of a negotiation if we ever return to the table. But we're going to set ours now as well. We will set our boundaries. And we will be dragged sooner rather than later away from the prospect of any kind of solution. For, if the Palestinians want to pick a fight with the Americans, that's their business. But I would argue it's counterproductive. You're going to have an election in November. And I'm not talking as a Republican or as a Democrat. But anybody looking at this situation might argue that if you truly had a strategic interest in promoting Palestinian statehood, you probably would want to see the re-election of the current president. You would probably want to see the re-election of the current president, which would mean essentially that you're not going to force him into a position to take action that will weaken the prospects of his own election. Finally, I'll come back to my initial point. Just because we're stuck does not mean the pursuit of a strategy that's going to take us farther away than ever from our goal. Admission of Palestine now without an agreement will take Palestinians farther away from sovereignty. "

    "data":"Thank you so much. And thank you for coming tonight, and thank you for inviting me to this debate. I have four reasons that I would like to emphasize why Palestine should be admitted to the UN. The first is that time is not an infinite commodity. And time -- we're losing time. And with the continuation of Israeli settlements on the ground, which are illegal, and after 20 years of failed negotiations, we cannot have the risk of losing the two-state solution. If Palestine is not accepted as a state very soon, there will be no two-state solution. And the outcome will be dangerous and bad for everybody. So we need the UN in this case to change the parameters, to change the course, the course of failure which Mr. Miller is defending. What Mr. Miller has suggested and what probably Mr. Gold will suggest is to continue the same path of failure, the same negotiation that's failed to produce anything because of the imbalance. What -- and that, in my opinion, is irresponsible towards Palestinians and irresponsible towards Israelis as well. What they are proposing is to continue what Einstein described as insanity, which is doing the same thing over and over again and expect different results. Third, it also indicates, as I suspect Mr. Gold will show, such a position against UN admission indicates an underlying intention of rejecting the principle of having a Palestinian state, which means rejecting the right of the Palestinian people to be free. Continuing negotiations while settlements continue to grow is like having two sides negotiating over a piece of cheese. One side, the Palestinian side, is stuck behind bars. The Israeli side having access to the piece of cheese and eating it while negotiating. At the end of the day, we'll find nothing to negotiate about. And that is not a solution. So my second point is that in the light of the failure of the disability and inability of the United States for internal reasons that are well-known to you, and in the light of the weakness of the Europeans and their participation, and in the light of the stubbornness of the Israeli extreme right wing, we have to find a way for a new strategy. We have one of three options. Either Palestinians would surrender to injustice, and that's what some people are calling for. In this case, what you will witness is the consolidation of a system of apartheid, where Palestinians are discriminated against. And Israel would become the worst apartheid system in the 21st century, something that nobody could be proud about. Or the second option is violence, which we reject, and we don't want. The third option is to have nonviolence, peaceful resistance, exactly like Gandhi did in India, and like Martin Luther King did here in the United States. And that's the course we are taking. And that's why going to the UN is nothing but another act of diplomatic resistance within the context of popular nonviolent resistance to change parameters and to change the balance of power so that we can have productive negotiations really and have a result at the end of the road. My third point is that, supposing our right to be admitted to the United Nations will be sending the right message, the message of respect to human rights, the message of respect to people's right for self-determination, the message of respect of the right of people to be sovereign. If we speak about the right of people in South Sudan and in Kosovo and in Libya and in Syria to be free and to have self-determination, then why not Palestine? And why continue to use the double standard, especially that admitting Palestine in the UN would be about correcting a historical mistake that was made. Since 1947 resolution the United States spoke about two states, Israel was established. Palestine was not. My last point is that we know that admitting Palestine to the United Nations would not immediately create a change on the ground. We understand, but it will achieve three goals. First, it will give us hope. It will give Palestinians hope. Hope is what we need today to sustain a nonviolent approach to our resistance and struggle. Desperation and lack of hope as is advocated on the other side will only bring violence and dangerous things. Second, accepting Palestine will actually invalidate all the de facto actions on the ground that are made by Israel and by creating settlements. And, third, it will send a message to the Israelis that they will not be really free unless Palestinians are also free. We are now victims of oppression and discrimination. The Israelis are hostage to occupation and fear, especially security fear. And Mr. Gold will try to show you that there is more fear today because of the Arab Spring. Instead of Israel being happy about people becoming democratic, they are having more fear. This is not the right approach. We want to liberate ourselves through popular nonviolent resistance through admission to the United Nations, but we also want to liberate the Israelis as well. Martin Luther King liberated the United States, not only the African-Americans, from segregation as well as Mandela liberated the whole of South Africa, the whites and the blacks together by liberating South Africa from apartheid. And that's why what we want, what we are working for, is to liberate ourselves from oppression, the longest occupation in modern history, and the worst apartheid system, and to liberate the Israelis from fear, from the security phobia. One time a Palestinian leader came to the United Nations with a gun and an olive branch. Today we are coming to the United Nations with two olive branches. Don't let us drop them. Thank you. "

    "data":"Those of you who are voting tonight should remember that we're speaking about Palestinian membership at the U.N., we're not in New Hampshire. When I served as Israel's ambassador to the United Nations back in the late 1990s, I had a colleague, a counterpart, who was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, became a very close friend, it's someone I intellectually admired. His name, unfortunately he's passed away, was Richard Holbrooke. And one of the things I was struck by, before I was sent to the U.N. I was the Israeli negotiator. I was sent to the sand dunes of Gaza where Muhammad [unintelligible] picked me up in that extended Mercedes and take me to Arafat's house. We would discuss how to move forward in peace, and, by the way, those discussions were tough because he -- when you're in a meeting like that, you don't know where to park your head. Should you remember the Israelis who died in repeated suicide terrorist attacks that came out of territory under Arafat's jurisdiction? I know that's tough to mention, but you've got to know that. Do you think of those people? Do you think about the moment? Do you think about building a future? Do you forget about the tragedies of the past so you'll have hope? How do you orient yourself? It's very, very tough. But I had that experience. We were involved in -- I spent hours with Mahmoud Abbas, Abu Mazen. I spent a tremendous time on the Hebron Agreement with Aaron and of course the Wye Agreement that followed afterwards. And what I had seen in the '90s is that we didn't succeed. We didn't succeed. We reached agreements. And, by the way, the man that some spokesmen like to try and put in the corner Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed two agreements with the Palestinians -- withdrew from territory, made sacrifices for peace, risked his whole political base because he wanted to move the process forward. It may not be the conventional wisdom in certain circles, but I experienced that. But let me go back to Holbrooke. So I saw that we had a tough time moving forward. And after I left government in 1999 and when Mr. Ehud Barak came into office. And Barak went to Camp David with Yasser Arafat. The peace wasn’t concluded. But I asked myself through my contacts with Holbrooke, “How was it?” And Richard Holbrooke delivered the greatest political diplomatic achievement of the Clinton administration, the Dayton Accords over Bosnia. Well, we didn’t succeed in the Middle East. We failed at Camp David. I’m not sure I still understand why that occurred. By the way, that is a tough conflict, the battle between Croats, Bosnian Muslims, the Serbs, was religious, ethnic, territorial. It had all the ingredients that we had. But they persisted. They persisted to negotiate. I discerned from my discussions with Holbrooke and from reading his memoirs on that conflict that there were three elements. He concluded that there must be a negotiated outcome. As much as you could be cynical about tough negotiations, that’s the only outcome that will work. The second thing that comes from my experience with talking to him and also in his memoirs is that peacemaking must come from the parties themselves. The great breakthroughs of Dayton came from those three warring parties. It’s true. They were brought to Ohio. It’s true. Secretary of State was in and out. President Clinton was ready to come in. But they themselves were responsible for reaching peace and imperfect peace. And finally, you need diplomatic flexibility. Let me tell you something. Both sides, certainly in our case -- I can speak to Israelis -- we have a deep inner conviction in the justice of our cause. But tonight’s not the night to lay that out to you. The point is that even though you have that deep inner conviction, the point is that even though you can go on every American network from CNN to FOX Television and lay that out to the American audience, you have got to make a compromise. You’ve got to cut a deal. You can’t walk away. And because they knew there had to be a negotiated outcome, because they knew it had to come from the parties themselves and the needed diplomatic flexibility, in the Balkans, they cut a deal, an imperfect deal. In fact, Holbrooke writes in his book the critical question: Will the Bosnians grasp an imperfect peace or let the war resumed remain unresolved right up until Dayton was convened? Now, let me move to the issue at hand between us. What is my problem with the proposal that a Palestinian state be recognized as a U.N. member state? As I said in my opening words, this isn’t about national dignity. You know, every people wants to recognized. And there are a lot of peoples out there beyond the discussion of who’s supposed to get independence -- Kurds, Tibetans, you name it -- every national movement wants to be recognized to the U.N. So my question isn’t about recognizing the rights of Palestinians. That was recognized by Menachem Begin back at Camp David in 1978. My question is really twofold, and my concern is twofold. First of all, carefully listening to the speech of Mahmoud Abbas on September 23rd this year, or last year now, at the U.N. General Assembly, he wasn’t just saying, “Accept us in principle.” He was laying out borders. And I think Aaron made the reference to it, the June 4, 1967 line, as though there was some kind of pre-’67 boundary, border, that was an international line that we have to agree to. That’s it. When we signed the Oslo Agreements, borders were supposed to be negotiated. And that -- to that point, to that very point, Yasser Arafat agreed. He signed those agreements. Or actually Abu Mazen signed the first agreement. The implement agreements, he later signed. So we're talking about predetermining the final boundaries by moving to the UN. "

    "data":"Thank you and good evening, um… For the radio audience I’ve just placed a teapot and a teacup on the lectern. It’s a pleasure to be here this evening, thank you to our host, the Rosenkranz Foundation, to NPR. Thank you also, to—thank all of you for coming and thank you to the opposing team, for what I know will be a well-articulated argument for something we all wish were true. Unfortunately it is not. I am here to argue for the motion that Russia is becoming our enemy again. I’d like to begin with a few definitions. Russia is an enormous polity encompassing more than 140 million people, 11 time zones and a multitude of views. I’m sure that many people in this room are personally acquainted with Russians who are by no means our enemies. Uh, but inside Russia, their views count for less and less. And in speaking of Russia, we must speak increas—of the increasingly authoritarian state— In speaking of Russia in this debate tonight, the increasingly authoritarian Russian state of President Putin, of the security apparatus, and the chief and increasingly centralized and authoritarian centers of power. Um, another definition I’d like to just get into quickly that’s important is “enemy.” The American Heritage Dictionary, which seems appropriate tonight, defines “enemy” as, quote, “one who manifests malice or hostility toward or opposes the purposes or interests—interests of another. A foe; an opponent.” Finally, no one is here tonight that Ru—to argue that Russia is right now our enemy. The motion up for debate is that Russia is becoming our enemy again. It is that direction, that becoming, that trajectory, which we are here to debate. For two benchmarks, I would like to share with a memory of a dinner in Moscow more than a decade ago. It was with someone who has experienced, then and since, firsthand, Russia’s trajectory not at a distance but has been living it. Uh, he was then optimistic, it was a dinner with a number of journalists and despite our worries, he assured us that all would be well, that Russia was heading in a good direction, that Russians could get rich doing honest business. His name was Garry Kasparov. Today, Mr. Kasparov has been pouring forth articles and giving interviews in the West warning us that Russia is becoming, indeed has become, a criminal petrostate. The model he tells us is not the old czarist autocracy, but The Godfather, the Mafia. He wants to run in the Presidential felection next March, but what he recently told MSNBC is that we’re not—quote, “We’re not fighting to win elections, we’re fighting to have elections.” Okay, that may be bad for Russia, but does it mean that Russia’s government is becoming America’s enemy. Yes. We live in an age when governments tend to export their creeds, methods, and technologies—uh, and techniques, excuse me. And, um, I’d like to just invite you for a minute to imagine, engage in a little imaginary experiment, that you are a Russian democrat, a patriot, trying to warn the free world that Russia is becoming an increasingly dangerous police state. Let’s say you’re investigating the murder of a journalist and you meet in a city, say London, with an emissary of the Kremlin. You have every right to the question you wish to ask, tea is served. Would you without a second thought these days, drink that tea? This is a picture of Alexander Litvinenko who drank it, he’s here on this deathbed, these are the effects of Polonium 210 on the human body. This—the Kremlin denies anything to do with it. Uh, this is a picture of Viktor Yushchenko, during his successful bid for the Presidency of the Ukraine, over the Kremlin’s objections, these are the effects of dioxin on the human face. The Kremlin denies anything to do with it. Uh, to get to the bottom of such stories, can we turn to the Russian media. No, not likely. They’ve been murdered, harassed, taken over, again the trajectory in the early ‘90s, when that optimistic dinner with Garry Kasparov took place, Russia had a lively press, you could quarrel with what they wrote, but they could say what they wanted to, the shutdowns and takeovers since then, and I include a very partial list— NTV, the independent TV station, ORT, all sort of coopted by government forces. The newsweekly Itogi Savonia [PH], TV-6, Kommersant, the list goes on. The broad narrative over this time is that there have been phases and steps forward and back, to this direction that the Russian government is taking. But, the broad arc, is that in the early 1990s, everything was up for grabs, the rules, the property, the whole thing, it was being sorted out. At this point, the shake-out has largely taken place. What do we see. The government has effectively reabsorbed the revenues coming from such oil and gas giants as Yukos and Gazprom. Uh, we’ve seen them murdering of journalists, we’ve see the targeting of businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who wanted to engage on Western terms with Western business. We’ve seen the increasing control over the regions, we’ve seen the rising charade of elections with President Putin now suggesting he might want to stay on as Prime Minister. Again the rise of the authoritarian state. Again, does this make Russia our enemy. Um…yes, that’s—and the reason why is, governments such as this need enemies to justify what they do, to deflect anger and frustrations, to show that they are important and necessary. And in Russia’s—the Russ—Russia in the sense of those who now rule— In Russia’s quest to do that the real rival is the US. And, following, sort of the initial and conditional cooperation we saw in a sort of sunny phase just after September 11th— even that was problematic—Russia’s government has become increasingly hostile and confrontational. If I run out of time my colleagues are going to cover more for you, but, let’s give a few examples. Uh, Putin’s polarizing speech in February in Munich accusing the US of, quote, singling out the US, of forcing its will on the world, and accusing the US of undermining international security. Quote, “One state, the United States, has oversepped a— stepped its national borders in every way,” he said. You can find a great many more examples of states, you can argue about US policy but, he was directing this at the US for the world to hear. Um, according to a recent statement by the US Director of National Intelligence, Russia now spies on the US nearly as much as during the Cold War. Uh, the difficulties raised for neighbor nearby states, uh, which are inclined to be friendliest to the US including…lobbing a missile into Georgia, fiddling with gas supplies to the Ukraine, waging cyberwar on Estonia, and, finally, Iran, where Russia has spent more than a decade over US protests transferring nuclear technology. Uh, and at the UN in Security Council efforts to do something about this has been, one of the prime obstacles, watering down resolutions, objecting, signing only when——it may, may—it couldn’t really do much more. Oil prices. Russia has every interest in keeping those high, roiling the Middle East, making trouble that is…in—inimical to US interests. Six years ago President Bush looked into President Putin’s eyes and thought he saw a friend of the United States of America. If only. What we have been learning since then as Russia charts it scourse, its direction of becoming, is that in America’s dealings with the Kremlin, it is wiser as with any antagonist, foe, opponent, enemy in the making, to watch your back. Thank you very much."

    "data":"It’s a pleasure to be with you and a pleasure to be a part of this event. I think everybody in this hall would agree that Russia today is not a US ally, not even a disaffected ally as so many of our traditional friends are. But then to claim that Russia is, or soon will be an enemy, seems to us to be both wrong, and unhelpful, almost certainly even harmful. It’s wrong because it misunderstands what Russia’s all about, and it misunderstands what motivates its foreign policy. And it’s unhelpful, maybe even harmful as I’ve said, because it almost certainly runs the risk of bringing about the behavior and the stance on Russia’s part that we fear in the first place, and not the least, not the least, by…driving home or reinforcing the extraordinary excessive suspicion of the US that radiates across not merely the political leadership but the political spectrum in Russia, and the enormously warped misinterpretation of US, uh, foreign policy and what we are all about. There’s no question, that Putin’s Russia, Putin himself has put Russia, in the forefront of the most vocal critics of US foreign policy, there’s no question that anti- Americanism within Russia, is more intense and more widespread not only than it has been at any point in the 15 years of Russian independence but well back into the Soviet period. There’s no question, that the Russian leadership and much of the political elite sees…NATO initiatives and US foreign policy initiatives as a threat to their national security, and indicate that they mean to offset them. There’s no question that what Russia’s doing on a number of issues of concern to us are contrary, is contrary to our preferences. Uh, and there is no question as Claudia has well-demonstrated, that under Putin Russia has veered from the democratic path. That makes Russia a challenge. That doesn’t make Russia an enemy. What is Russia about. I think three things. First of all a renewed voice. Russia once again wants a place at the table with the major powers. Secondly, Russia wants respect for its national interests as it defines them, not the way in which we define them. Secondly—or third, Russia wants an end to the assigned role as either a pupil or as a junior partner. As one of the Russians wrote not so long ago, “The pedagogical relationship is over,” and Russia wants an independent role in international politics, even a leadership role. And we’re seeing it increasingly in the way in which they exert themselves as a mediator on major issues, among and between major powers. And third, or second, what it wants beyond voice, is an enhanced power and influence within the post-Soviet space. And this in two ways particularly, first of all, as a lead role in managing security within that sphere, that’s very different from acquiring real estate, and secondly aggrandizing itself economically within the post-Soviet space, and aggrandizing itself economically is very important to Putin at this point. None of this you’ll notice, suggests that Russia is easy or not a problem for us, I said challenge. Doesn’t make it an enemy, and third it wants…it wants influence over the design of an evolving international order. The first step from that is to blunt what they see as excesses in US foreign policy. That’s a problem for us. They’re not the only country in the world that wants to blunt the excesses in US foreign policy. But they then go on to talk about collective major-power responsibility in international politics, and they want to extend the circle. They mean to bring in China and India and probably beyond that. So wherein then is the problem? What makes Russia a challenge and not an enemy. I think it is the ambiguity and the shapelessness at the very base of Russian foreign policy today. Because, the heart of Russia’s international posture today, is a unity of opposites. Russia claims it has no enemy, it has no ally. Everyone—no one is an enemy, no one is an ally, everyone is a partner, everyone is a competitor. And that leads to a behavior, which is troublesome not only for us but I think for the future of Russia in its foreign policy, a policy of trying to have its cake and eat it as well. And this and fur— furthermore is compounded by the absence of strategic vision, within Putin’s Russia, and on his part as leader. Uh, Russia foreign policy’s driven by impulses and di—and, and desires, but impulses are not a strategy. And even less are they a strategic vision. And without strategic vision Russia is not in a position to make durable, long-term strategic choices. So then, what should be our response in these circumstances. First of all, what not to do. What not to do is premature containment, and jumping to that conclusion. Not empty hectoring, not drawing red lines. Not even tough love, particularly when we have so little direct leverage in order to pursue that kind of a policy. And what to do? A policy that would be deft, that would be coherent, that would be frank, and that would be firm, and that would follow, in my view, three guidelines. First of all to try to engage in a constructive and an effective dialogue with Russia over all issues including the most fundamental ones that concern Claudia and her colleagues as, uh, even— uh, uh, that concerns us as much as it concerns Claudia and her colleagues, that is, the basic values question and where things are going within Russia. But not posturing. And in order to get to a dialogue with Russia we have a fundamental initial problem. That is to persuade not merely Putin and people around him but a vaude [sic]—broad part of the political spectrum, that our stake in this is not an ulterior motive, that it’s genuine, and that it is direct. Secondly, I think that… uh, we want to as much as possible focus on the overlap in our core interests, and they’re very considerable, while mitigating the increasingly tension-field [sic]—uh, tension-filled differences over tactics. The core interests are, the struggle against global terrorism. Islamic extremism. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And the issue that we forget about these days, that is regulating, producing stability among the nuclear haves, not merely dealing with the nuclear have-nots. This is now a multipolar nuclear world. And we need to manage it in a way that we’ve neglected for any number of years, and finally, in a still more positive note, to, uh, promote the progressive and dynamic development of the post-Soviet economies, not just Russia. The entire region, those are our common core interests, but we really do disagree often on how we go about a number of these cases, take the one that’s very much in the forefront of our mind these days, Iran. I would not for a moment deny that Russia and Putin and people around him, special interests around him have very self-regarding, selfish interests when it comes to developing their relationship with Iran. But at heart the problem is a different one. We agree, both Russia and the United States that we do not want a nuclear Iran. But, at the tactical level we disagree about first of all, what kind of a timeframe we’re operating in, how much time we have or not. And then secondly how we put carrots and sticks together. And the degree to which we privilege the sticks and privilege them early, that’s the kind of thing that we need to do if the core interest coordinate—if the core interest, is as I’ve said, to deny a nuclear Iran. Uh…the…the third guideline would be that we coordinate our assessment and our approach to Russia among the major countries of the West, Europe and Japan, while at the same time in our policy toward China and India, that we deny Russia the opportunity of using China and Indian against us Thank you. I’m finished."

    "data":"Well, like, uh, Claudia I wanna preface my comments by reminding, uh, all of you of what it is we are debating here. Uh, Claudia, Michael and I are not on this stage to argue that Russia is an enemy of the United States. And you as the audience are not here to vote on whether or not that proposition is true. Rather, we are here to make the case that Russia is becoming an enemy. So what’s at issue here, is the trend, the direction, the question of where all—all this is going. So let me devote my time to looking at in a very factual way, how events have unfolded in just the past year. Let me remind you that we are on the eve of the anniversary of the poisoning of, um, Alexander Litvinenko. Let me remind you also that Alexander Litvinenko was a British subject. He was murdered by a lethal dose of Pol—of Polonium 210, which was a de facto case of nuclear homicide if not nuclear terrorism. From his deathbed, Litvinenko personally accused Vladimir Putin of ordering the sa—the assassination. Since then, Scotland Yard has pinned, uh, the murder on a Russian businessman, an ex- or if you will current FSB man, named Andre—Andrei Lugovoi. [00:26:20:11] In July, the British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, noted that, quote, “The Russian government has failed to register either how seriously we treat this case, or the seriousness of the issues involved.” The Russian Foreign Ministry responded with a brush-off, that they could not understand why British would hazard its relationship with Russia, quote, “for the sake of one man.” For the sake of one man, let me remind you that, liberal democracy is constructed for the sake of one man. In a month’s time, Mr. Lugovoi, Litvinenko’s killer, is likely to be elected a member of the Russian parliament. In December of 2006, the Kremlin pulled out— pulled the rug out from the largest foreign, uh, investment to date in Russia, which was, uh, Shell’s 20—$20 billion oil and gas project on Sakhalin Island, using transparently phony regulatory excuses. It happened again in June to British Petroleum. The assault on foreign investment in Russia, was the natural extension of the illegal seizure of Russia’s privately held energy assets, particularly those of Yukos and its seek— and its CEO, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, whose prison term in a Siberian, uh, labor camp, has recently been extended. In January, Mr. Putin forced the Belarusian government to sign a new gas contract, or else have its gas supplies turned off in the dead of winter. Now Belarus is not a friend of the United States, but Ukraine and Georgia are friends of the United States. And in both cases Mr. Putin had previously used what I would call pipeline warfare to threaten his neighbors, to threaten and bully his neighbors at their coldest and most vulnerable moments. Nex—in the next month, in February, a man named Ivan Safronov, a reporter for the, uh, for the Kommersant newspaper, was—or I should say fell from a fourth-story window onto the street, where he died instantly. The authorities ruled it a suicide, but most observers believe that Safronov, who had repeatedly embarrassed the Russian military with his reporting, was executed, making him the 14th such journalist killed, murdered, during Mr. Putin’s reign. The same month, a Russian court condemned nine members of the ethnic minorities’ rights group Froda, for having a quote-unquote, “unsanctioned tea” with two German students. Quote, “We were told that under the new law on NGO’s, any meeting of two or more people, with the purpose of discussing publicly important issues, has to be sanctioned by the local administration three days in advance,” Froda’s director told London’s Daily Telegraph.The next month, in March, an American Russia analyst named Pol—named Paul Joyal, was shot outside his home in suburban Maryland, shortly after meeting a former KGB general. Four days before that shooting, on “Dateline NBC,” Mr. Jo—Joyal had noted that, quote, “A message has been communicated to anyone who wants to speak out against the Kremlin. If you do, no matter where you are, we will find you and we will silence you in the most horrible way possible,” end of quote. The next month, in April, Mr. Putin indicated that he intended to withdraw Russia from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, one of the landmark agreements ending the Cold War. He has since indicated, that he is prepared to withdraw Russia from the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed by Reagan and Gorbachov. The next month, in May, um, ethnic Russians rioted in the city of Tallinn, when the Estonian government decided to remove a World War II monument to their Soviet liberators. Estonia was subject to a conv—uh, to a concerted cyber-attack, and its ambassador in Moscow was attacked by youth protesters almost certainly belonging to a neo-fascist group known as Nashi, I should remind you that Estonia is a member of NATO and the European Union. In June, Mr. Putin warned that if the US deployed just 10 ballistic missile interceptors in Poland, then Russia will, quote, “have to get new targets in Europe. Which weapons will be used,” he said, “ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, or some completely new systems, that’s a technical matter.” In July, Mr. Putin took a vacation. In August… Um, in August, Russia detained a mainstream business journalist for the Vedomosti paper, a paper that is, uh, uh, partly owned by, by Dow Jones, on suspicious of so-called extremist activity, via a law that defines the term “extremist” so broadly that it can be used to target ordinary political critics of the Kremlin. Russia also resumed, and this is notable, a policy of sending its heavy bombers out on lower—long-range sorties, on more than several occasions, Norwegian, British, and finally American fighters have been forced to scramble into the air, in order to intercept these Russian bombers, the first time this has happened since the Cold War. In September, Mr. Putin appointed an unknown apparatchik, Mr. Vic—Viktor Zubkov, as Prime Minister, and later announced that he himself may become, uh, may—may—may become Prime Minister, um, in the next government, which is contrary to every prior promise he has made, that he would leave the political scene when his Presidential term expires. This sets the scene for the youthful Mr. Putin to remain in power for a very long time indeed. In October Mr. Putin became the first Russian leader to visit Tehran since Josef Stalin in 1943. He said Iran’s purposes are entirely peaceful, Russia has stopped, um, cooperating with the rest of the Security Council on the UN, forcing the US to resort to the uni—to—to unilateral sanctions. And finally I would like to make one point. Just last week George W. Bush insisted in a speech, that Russia is not an enemy of the United States. Now if that does not convince this audience that our side is right, I don’t know what will. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Thank you very much, thank you Rosenkranz Foundation, thank you the opposers of the motion, and thank you those who vote for it and thank you, Edward Lucas. Uh, there are at least three reasons as to why Russia is not becoming an enemy, or at least shouldn’t become one. One. Today the world is no longer bipolar, in fact it’s not even multipolar, even—um, unipolar, even if some in the United States may still think it is. That is America is no longer in a position to decide who to make or not to make an enemy, even though it certainly continues to be listened to in this regard. But there are many more actors in play today, China, Middle East, Europe, whose international interests have to be considered. There is no Cold War ideological divide in which one ideology wants to take over the other, and dominate the world. Thus at present, there are no geopolitical conditions for the Cold War. Two. Despite the 11 time-zones, Russia is not a Soviet empire, to fight against. It’s not an empire at all. Although true, under Vladimir Putin, it appears Russia still has its imperial ambitions as, uh, the, uh, those who supported the motion very ably demonstrated. However the country today doesn’t have its former capabilities. It could with varying successes create an illusion of those capabilities such as testing weapons, or, um…reinstating military exercises, which actually have been very much prone to accidents. Although at times Putin tries to flex his imperial muscles, old—at—old habits die hard, obviously. Such as during the 2004 Presidential Ukrainian elections, he’s more interested in being recognized as, uh, an international player than really building an empire. But if he feels, in order to be recognized as player he needs to play an empire, he would, and he does. Three. The United States grumble about Putin’s international policy, but loudly talks about his internal policy. But actually disagreements on how to run a state is not enough to make an enemy. Just look at Saudi Arabia. While in foreign policy, the discussion actually does take place. Here I would like to quote quite commonsensical Condoleeza Rice during the talks on the US missile defense plan in Eastern Europe. And I quote. “Even though we have our differences, we have a great deal in common, because that which unites us in trying to deal with threats of terrorism, of proliferation, is much greater than the issues that divide us.” She said it in Moscow on October 12th this year. Moreover, even Dick Cheney, who came out of the Dr. Strangelove Cold War generation, and thus sees enemies everywhere, in 2006 Vilnius presentation, despite his tough talk on Putin’s backtracking on democracy said, and I quote, “None of us believes that Russia is fated to become an enemy,” so it’s not just George Bush. There are smarter people who said that. Um, let me develop on all three points. To one, on ideological—on no ideological divide. In fact, Putin would argue that both Russia and the United States today are of the same ideology, that is democracy, and of the same economic system, which is capitalism. In essence, he feels they disagree on tactics, methodology, and implementation. The unifying context of his Presidency is that Russia will be great and strong if it continues to be a multi-party democracy. But, despite the wishes of the West, it can’t exist without a strong leader. President, Prime Minister, or wherever he chooses to continue to be. In Russia, the economy is free, he says, but the state must control its wealth. Therefore, Putin so bristles at suggestions that he’s backtracking on democracy. At the Valde [PH] discussion club, uh, meeting in Solche [PH] this September, Putin criticized the United States’ criticism as a ploy. And I quote. “We see efforts to exploit the phraseology of democracy to influence over internal politics. This is dangerous. It undermines faith in the basic principles of democracy, if you need something from us you need to talk about the substance, not to approach it from another angle. You need to re—you need to resolve Kosovo, talk about Kosovo. You need to resolve the, uh, nuclear issue from Iran, talk about Iran. Not about democracy in Russia.” To number two. On threatening so far imperial—Russia imperial ambition. Putin’s message that Russia is a great powerful and divinely ordained state, that stretches back 1000 years, and the fact that he’s there to restore its glory and its proper place in the world, is very much embraced by the Russians, as Mr. Rosenkranz indicated. At times, it may sound like boastful animosity. But this tough imperial-sounding stunt is only a logical consequences—consequence of the brutal disappointment of the Russians with the course of events since the collapse of Communism. Poverty, politic wars, crony privatization, the 1998 financial crisis, along with the humiliations, perceived and real, uh, inflicted the West, from the NATO expansion to endless preaching. As Russians see it, it is Putin’s no-nonsense rhetoric, and his firm actions both at home and abroad, that allowed— allows him, in just a dozen years, to lead the country from bankruptcy and despair to wealth and power. Which in Russia historically are thought of in imperial terms. To number three. To common interests. Putin is prepared to cooperate with the state. Even if he promptly switches to confrontation when he senses a snub, like that Cheney talk in vil— Vilnius. However, the Russian President’s and the US President’s…bickering is not about the future Cold War I think, but rather means the following, and these are my words, not theirs. We’re annoyed at each other, for either country putting itself first. Obviously, none lost superpower ambitions. For not being what the other wants it to be. But this is rather a political game, than a war, in a—an enemy public holder, while we deal with much more pressing issues that really preoccupy us, terrorism, nuclear threats, energy, security, and many, many more. In conclusion, USRussian relations today certainly display annoyance, and some genetic Cold War-rooted suspicions. So the language of the Cold War creeps in, and is read as animosity. But there is a serious recognition that there is plenty of common interest in the oil and energy strategy talks with Iran and North Korea and many others. Let’s face it. We all need a good enemy. And while bin Laden is at large, and terrorism is still amorphous, and the fight with it is not going too well, Russia and the United States need their Cold War dance moves to pass time before they figure out what their relationship really is, or should be, when next year, the next administration, at least in America, comes in. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you, Edward. It’s great to be here up in Manhattan, I don’t get up here a lot but if—if I have to go back to Washington knowing that you folks ratified Dick Cheney’s views on Russia, uh, I don’t know what I’m gonna be doing for the next week but certainly Edward will have to change the lead of his article, uh, for next week. Um…first, US Presidents since George Bush the elder, President Clinton, this current President Bush have bent over backwards, to make sure that Russia doesn’t become our enemy. We’ve done practically everything possible from subsidizing their economy to looking the other way at a lot of their transgressions to make sure that, that, uh, that we don’t offend Russia, we don’t try to over…make them overreact. We don’t criticize them too harshly and so forth. And, uh…but while we were doing that we chose to look the other way, when certain elements of the old Soviet regime, uh, regained power, consolidated power with gangster interests that took advantage of the economic reforms, and seized control in the form of Vladimir Putin. And that is the former secret police, uh, the Chekists, the KGB, who have managed to take control of a formerly— of a former democratic experiment, and turn it into a dictatorship. And any secret police system in the world needs to have a foreign enemy in order to justify its own political grip on power. So, given that, it’s the will of the Putin regime itself to have the United States as an enemy, and to become an enemy of the United States in order to perpetuate itself in power. This was revealed in Kommersant Daily in, in early 2000, after Putin became President, when Putin’s chief of staff and the state security chief Petrushev, got together and they decided the democratic institutions should not be nurtured. In fact they should be, uh, there should be a return to, to rule by force in Russia. And they recommended exceeding the Constitutional limitations on the power of the Presidency, to create this dictatorship. And to create the nec—necessary conditions not just in Russia, but in the near abroad, which is the old Sovietspeak for the, for the former Soviet empire. So there was a clandestine manipulation and, and oppression of political parties, of politicians. We saw the faces of, of, of one of the Ukrainian politicians who, who happened to run afoul of them. Another one of those politicians, Galina Starovoitova was on our editorial board, she was murdered before, before this document happened but another one of our members of our editorial board, Yuri Shekoshekin [PH], uh, editor, very brave editor was, was poisoned to death, uh… as a—as a staunch critic of the KGBization of the new Russian government. This document, uh, was designed to promote Putin as the President, and to, and to wage, quote, “preventive political action.” Throughout Russia, and to plant KGB personnel, throughout the Presidency, throughout the government ministries, in control of the armed forces as it never had been before, and in control of governorships, and administrative regions across the country. At the same time there was no accountability or national reconciliation so if you look at, at South Africa after apartheid they had truth commissions to uncover the crimes of the past, or Chile, or Argentina, or El Salvador, or Poland, or East Germany, or the Czech Republic. Or so many other countries that had been under a tyrannical government, had tried to come clean and expose the secrets of the past and the—and the—and those who were responsible for committing those crimes against humanity. That was never the casein Russia. Where there was a de- Stasification campaign in East Germany against the Stasi, there was nothing of the sort in Russia. So no one has brought—been brought to trial, no one has been, been exposed or held accountable for any of the crimes of the past. And as a result of that lack of accountability, and lack of national introspection, it’s become normal among most Russians to be treated as they had been. And so there is no coming to terms with the past, nobreak…no de-Nazification, imagine having a, a free West Germany without de-Nazification. And allowing former Gestapo to stay in their posts, and even become President of the country, it—it’s the moral equivalent there. So, all—over time they’ve whittled away at human rights, they’ve whittled away with—at a free press and everything else. At the same time, this summer, the Russian government came out with an ideological guidelines [sic] for social studies and history for public schools in Russia. And it’s a Kremlin-imposed guideline. Putin himself addressed the teachers and the academics at the book launch, he said, “We must not allow others to impose a feeling of guilt on us.” In the Washington Post coverage of, of this event, uh, they surveyed the sto—social studies guide, they said it’s, quote, “marked by intense hostility to the United States.” And the editor of the manual, Leonid Polyakov, said “We are developing a national ideology that represents the vision of ourselves as a nation, as Russians, a vision of our own identity, and the world around us.” A paranoid, hostile, enemy-oriented identity. Stalin in these books is shown, for the teachers’ guidelines in the Russian public schools he’s shown as, quote, “the most succ—successful leader of the USSR.” And the guidelines on teaching about Stalin’s crimes are so ambiguous, that they’re not even required in Russian public schools. And the last chapter of the history guidebook…lays out a new cult of personality of the new Russian President. Quote, “We see that practically every significant deed is connected with Vladimir V. Putin.” So this cult of personality is being built, they require some foreign adversary to, to justify the repressive measures they take. Now the iconography of the old KGB has been preserved, imagine if, if after de-Nazification in West Germany, they’re—the old symbols were still preserved of the, of the, of the, of the Nazi party. Yet if you go to the Russian police stations, they have the sword and shield, that’s the old Bolshevik Cheka secret police symbol. You go to the Foreign Intelligence Services offices, they have the same symbol, you go to the FSB State Security Services, they have the same symbol. You go to the, to the state prosecutor, they have the same symbol. So that same conscious iconography of the past, where the sword was there in Drz—Felix Dzerzhinsky’s words, to, “to protect the revolution even if it came down on the heads of the innocent.” This is the type of system that Russia’s preserving. You have an out-of-control spy services [sic], where corruption, uh…contract killings, bombings since Putin has been, uh, suc— was first state security chief and then Prime Minister, and then President. The Russian military intelligence, which feeds on paranoia, the same way it did in the Soviet times, that—that organization has not been reformed at all. Yet, that continues to feed on paranoia, uh, of the paranoia, in its intelligence reporting to the Russia military and political leadership, that the West is still a great threat. Organized crime is, is rampant in a country ith a huge secret police system that could easily crush it if it wanted to. Journalists who investigate organized crime have been murdered, especially those investigating the organized crime in St. Petersburg, where Putin used to handle hard-currency operations before he came to, to, uh, Moscow. When he took power as President he stuffed the government with KGB people, to the Defense Minister, the first time in Russian history that a secret policeman had been put in charge—of the military. Military reform has not occurred. In fact the military is modernizing, they have an intercontinental ballistic missile force, brand new, modern force, the Topol-M. They don’t need it. We’re not their enemy, they don’t need it. Right now as we’re speaking, the Yuri Dolgoruky which is a new Borei class, uh, submarine, nuclear submarine, is undergoing its sea trials now, new ballistic missile submarine, more modern than anything we have, they don’t need it. They’re building—uh, an aircraft-carrier fleet is in their budget for the next few years as well, as a power-projection force. This is not a sign of a country that’s seeking to be an ally of the West, and every sign that intends…that the intent is in the future to have the capability to be our enemy if the political climate so declares. Thank you."

    "data":"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming this evening, particularly if, uh, you’re voting against the motion. I urge you to reject the motion, ladies and gentlemen. To reject it…is not at all to defend Russia, or to defend Mr. Putin. It is to be clear about US interests, and about realistic US policy options. It’s to be realistic about the complexity of the world in which we have to conduct our foreign policy. Indeed—indeed the motion is wrong for at least three main reasons in my view. First it gets Russia wrong from the standpoint of US national security interests. Whoever’s in the White House, whether a Democrat or a Republican, will have to advance those same US national security interests…many of which we share with Russia, that my colleagues have named, uh, and, and, these are absolutely vital to our national security. Uh, for example, combating nuclear pro—uh, proliferation, uh, uh, counter— counteracting Islamic extremism around the world. I’ll develop this a bit further. The second reason that the motion…is wrong, is that it lacks historical perspective, and is incorrect on its face. Russia is not the Soviet Union…the motion conflates the two, Russia could not be becoming our enemy again, this Russia has never been our enemy. So the motion is simply wrong on its face. If we were in a courtroom, I would ask the judge for a directed verdict. And I urge you to consider one too. Third, the motion is framed with a friend-versus-foe mentality, that is most likely…to lead us down the wrong path. It misunderstands the world which is much more complicated. There’s a vast middle distance. All those who are not our friends are not necessarily our enemies, and are not necessarily becoming our enemies. It’s that difficult work in the middle distance, uh…that Russia, challenges us to do. Russia’s becoming more difficult… indeed, in many, many ways. But it’s not becoming our enemy, certainly not our enemy again. We are not their enemy, they are not ours. Russia may be its own worst enemy. Indeed I think it is in many, many respects. But that does not make it our enemy. Again to go back to US national security interests, questions of this are not about metaphysics or metaphors. They’re about concrete security interests. Where we find interests in common with other countries, we must work together with them as best we can. We may have disagreements, there may be friction, there may be deep disappointments and indeed there is great disillusionment and disenchantment in the mutual relationship today. On both sides. Nevertheless that doesn’t change our core national security interests, in containing weapons of mass destruction, in limiting the proliferation of fissile materials, in strategic arms control, in stability through Eurasia… and in the Middle East and in countering Islamic extremism around the world. These are core issues, they have not changed recently for us, or for the Russians. We need to do a better job working together, to address these interests. Second, once again, the proposition simply cannot be correct on its face. Russia has not been our enemy before. We are not talking here about the Soviet Union, or a return to the USSR. Or a return to the gulag…or to rule by the Communist party. So there is no “again” at play here. And I urge you to take the words seriously, the words do matter, when we vote on a motion. We don’t have a new Cold War coming. It may be a cool peace, but that’s a very important distinction. It’s disagreeable, it’s suboptimal, it’s difficult, but it’s not a war. It’s a heightened challenge. We go through this kind of debate in the United States periodically. Who lost Russia. Right? The Red threat, we did it in—during our last political cycle, we’re doing it again now. We ought to be careful about this, we need to separate the rhetoric from the reality and the rhetoric from what are the core US national security interests, that any President and any administration will have to serve. Finally I wanna talk about the mind-set, the friend-foe problem. Because it really represents a mentality that has gotten us into more trouble, uh, in recent times, and I think we need to steer clear of it. We need, we need to pay careful attention to distinctions and details…in assessing the trend lines, lest, the friend-foe distinctions become a—a selffulfilling prophecy. It simply need not be so. It need not be so. Regrettably there are people in Russia, who think the same way. If we were in Moscow today, I’d be debating against them. Reminding them that the US is not their enemy and is not becoming their enemy. But so too I remind you today, Russia is not becoming our enemy. There’s a vast middle distance. Lots of difficult complicated countries. China. Pakistan. Turkey. Saudi Arabia. All countries where we could have…a long discussion, about the litany…of problems, of sorrows, of mistakes, as we’ve just heard about Russia. It doesn’t make them our enemy. It doesn’t mean that they’re becoming our enemy. They are counterparts, partners with whom we have to work. We have to work on a basis of shared interests where we can find them, and we have those with Russia. We know who the real enemies are. I don’t need to remind people, in this city certainly, who real enemies of the United States are. In my view we can’t afford to shift our focus from our real enemies to our imagined ones. In sum, once again, Russia may very well be its own worst enemy, but that does not make it our enemy. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Good evening. It’s a pleasure to kick off tonight’s debate. I’m gonna start by telling you a couple of things that my colleagues and I are not arguing, in our support for tonight’s resolution. First, in arguing that spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea, my colleagues and I are not arguing that the people of the Middle East—whether defined as Arabs, Muslims, or in any other way—are inherently less capable of democratic development than any other ethnic, cultural or religious group. Second, we do not question the desirability of democracy, or the benefits of living under a democratic political order. I have the good fortune of being an American citizen solely through the accident of my birth. But my two colleagues tonight, came to this country from elsewhere, and embraced American citizenship by choice, precisely because they are convinced of democracy’s desirability. In arguing that spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea, my colleagues and I want to look at tonight’s resolution through the prism of American national interests. Of course US interests in the Middle East are complex and multifaceted, but I’m gonna boil down our most important interests in this critical region to three things. First, the free flow of oil from the Persian Gulf, second, the security and welfare of the state of Israel, and third, keeping the Middle East from providing a platform for further mass-casualty terrorist attacks of the sort that we suffered on 9-11. I will argue for tonight’s resolution because I believe that promoting democracy in the Middle East is not just not helpful for these interests, it is downright harmful to them. Let’s look first at terrorism. President Bush and his administration’s defenders have argued since the United States began preparing to invade Iraq, that spreading democracy in the Middle East is the essential antidote to jihadist terrorism originating in the region. But there is literally not a shred of hard evidence supporting that proposition. From Osama bin Laden on down, that claim that jihadist terrorists are products of economic and political marginalization is simply false. The 9-11 hijackers were truly trust-fund terrorists, from economically and politically advantaged backgrounds. Proponents of democracy promotion in the Middle East also argue, that democratization is needed to counteract the distorting effects of madrasa educations on the mind-set of millions of young Arabs and Muslims in the region. But the fact is that Al Qaeda and other internationally active terrorist groups, don’t recruit from madrasas. Look at it in practical terms. To be an internationally active jihadist terrorist, you need, for example, English language skills, you need a certain level of technical competence. Madrasas are not the place where one acquires that kind of skill-set. That’s why Al Qaeda and other internationally active jihadist terrorist groups recruit primarily among university students and university graduates. Indeed if you look at the backgrounds of terrorists who have been recruited over the years by Al Qaeda, you find the number-one subject that they studied at university was engineering, the number-two subject was medicine. Democracy promotion is not going to win the war on terror, in fact the Bush administration has tacitly acknowledged that promoting democracy is not winning the war on terror. Since 2005, in the annual Patterns of Global Terrorism report, the administration has, as a matter of policy, withheld publishing the aggregate statistics showing the number of significant terrorist incidents around the world each year. They withhold that information, I would suggest, not because the data show that the number of incidents is getting less. It is actually getting greater-- democracy promotion will not help us win the war on terror. Now let’s turn to Israel’s place in the region. Proponents of democratization in the Middle East often advance what I call the garbage-collection model of lowering Palestinian and Arab expectations. This model assumes that Palestinians and their sympathizers in the Arab and Muslim worlds don’t really care that much about Palestinians living under occupation, that Palestinian and other Arab leaders use Israel as a convenient way to deflect popular attention from their own performance. I myself heard President Bush argue in the White House Situation Room, that a democratically-elected Palestinian government would be more focused on collecting garbage, and less, quoteunquote, “hung up” on territory and the status of Jerusalem. Well, we tested this theory in the 2006 Palestinian elections, and the result was Hamas’s victory in internationally supervised balloting in the West Bank and Gaza. The hard reality is that negotiating peace between Arab states and Israel is not popular in the Middle East. Arab-Israel peacemaking requires that Arab states—that, that the United States work with indigenous regimes in Arab states that are prepared to pursue peace with Israel, not because it is popular, but because those leaders judge it to be in their countries’ national interests. This is the approach that was pursued by Anwar Sadat in the Camp David accords. Sadat paid the ultimate price for that initiative. But it is the model that has been followed by his successor, President Mubarek, by King Hussein and his successor King Abdullah in Jordan. It is the model that is being followed today by Saudi King Abdullah in the Arab League Peace Initiative. Promoting democracy in the Middle East will not enhance the prospects for Arab-Israel peacemaking, it will in fact, harm prospects for peace. The same argument can also be extended to eliciting the absolutely essential cooperation of regional regimes, to enable the United States to play its critical role as the guarantor of physical security for Persian Gulf oil fields. The legacy of 20th century colonialism in the Middle East, oil concessions, and all the rest, mean that it is not popular for regional regimes to cooperate with hegemonic power. While there is no evidence that democracy reduces the incidence of terrorism, there is ample evidence—from places like Egypt and Saudi Arabia—that holding more open elections in these and other societies would produce governments that are more anti-American than incumbent regimes. Given this reality, how is it in America’s interest to rush these countries’ populations into voting booths? A couple of final points. Advocate of democracy promotion in the Middle East, oftentimes argue that by promoting democracy, we are also promoting the spread of liberal values, the emancipation of women, um…and other things that Americans hold right and dear. And…they often suggest that, if we are not engaged in promoting this kind of agenda, we really are—to use Mr. Rosenkranz’s phrase—cynical supporters of despotic regimes. But, if you look at popular attitudes in the Arab and Muslim world, these attitudes are not just increasingly anti-American in their orientation toward international issues. They are less reformist on internal issues than many incumbent regimes. The best hope for modernization and ultimately liberalization, in the Arab and Muslim worlds today, lies in incumbent regimes who recognize that, first of all economic modernization is essential to their country’s future."

    "data":"Good evening, everybody. You saw me looking around in a little bit of a panic and that’s because I realized I left my glasses in the other room. So I’m just going to hold this a little bit further forward, if you’ll forgive me. Before anything else, let us all agree that democracy is a good, in and of itself. It doesn’t require a wit as sharp as Winston Churchill’s to know that, stacked up against dictatorship, mob rule or even benevolent tyranny, democracy – notwithstanding all of its imperfections, is the best system of government. Let’s also accept that democracy means a great deal more than elections and that when we say democracy we’re really using a shorthand for a system that contemplates representative readership, rule of law, economic as well as political freedoms and more. Finally, let’s stipulate that while we expect our news to arrive instantaneously, our paychecks to be deposited immediately and our diets to work miraculously, democracy is indeed a long term project. I’m pleased to see that Flynt, Shibley…Shibley, uh, Dimitri, uh, have accepted the idea that the system of government most admired in the Middle East is democratic and that they agree that people do indeed aspire to freedom in that region. And I must say I agree with the caveat that people do not aspire to freedom that is eclipsed by fear for the future and for their own security and well being. So we have a moral good that we are all agreed upon in the abstract. What we don’t agree about is the strategic imperative or the appropriate role of the United States. We can debate about that a little bit later but the foundation of that debate should be a proper understanding of the nexus between tyranny and terrorism. How do groups like Al Qaeda operate? It should be clear by now that in parasitic fashion these groups feed off of host nations that are weak. They operate with a key, with a core group who are committed ideologues and do come from all walks of life. But the real sustenance, but that is, that is only part of the story. The real sustenance for Al Qaeda and other light groups is an environment that tolerates their methods in appreciation of their supposed ideals. For many it is not necessarily the virgins that await or the triumphs of the return of the Caliphate. Rather, it is the relief from the life in purgatory that constitutes the average lot of the average Arab. That life is about unemployment, real rates of up to thirty-five and forty per cent – and young men, who when polled consistently complain that their existence offers no hope and no opportunity. It is about the fact that the United Nations development program estimates that nine per cent of every business deal in the Middle East goes for bribes and when students who want to vote step into the streets of Cairo they risk arrest and torture, like Karim Suleiman [PH], who was sodomized and tortured because he demonstrated in favor of the rule of law. These victims of Middle Eastern oppression are the ones who provide the oxygen that enables Al Qaeda to operate and it gives resonance to their political messages. And why? If your life and your father’s life and your son’s life is lived under the yoke between this or dictator for life that, you cannot form a new political organization and you cannot change your system of government and you cannot begin to help yourself and you look for other options. And if the only haven in which you can talk about those options is in the mosque and the only thing the mosque is offering up is Islamic purity, a return to greatness and the uncorrupted life of the true believer, it shouldn’t be a great wonder that such ideas take hold. If you find that argument unpersuasive let’s for a moment look from our opponent’s viewpoint. They rightly suggest that in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Palestine – I could go on – the main opposition parties are Islamist. But why? It’s because they have a proven record of delivering on a better life? Is it because somehow they have more charisma than other opponents of the regime? Or is the fact that the Islamists have successfully used the vast religious networks and cash available to them to promote their own political cause – occupying the only political space that exists in the authoritarian Arab world. There are only two places for breathing room in the current Middle Eastern political construct -- the dictator space and the Islamists. Oppression gives the Islamists the popularity to move their agenda and further the environment in which Al Qaeda is tolerated and worse. And they know it. In extensive writings, including by Bin Laden and Zarqawi-- and here I really disagree with what Flynt had to say – they rail against democracy because they know it represents a threat to their lifeline. Zarqawi wrote to Ayman al-Zawahiri bemoaning the future of their fight in Iraq. Democracy is coming, he wrote, and there will be no excuse thereafter. So what is the answer? The answer cannot be that because Hamas and others take advantage of the democratic process, therefore, democracy is discredited. We must confront systems that tolerate Islamists and provide ideological safe haven to Al Qaeda. And the way to do that is by insuring that there are other opposition parties, genuine reformers, who have the power and the money to make their voices heard. Our opponents will argue that the United States has no role to play, that where we interfere we make things worse and that with our inconsistency we risk destabilizing the region. That is an unacceptable formulation. It is certainly true that the United States is not a fault free advocate for democracy. I can now agree that there are times when the reality of foreign policy demands that we do business with objectionable leaders. But there is no reason to rely on the brutality of dictators because that brutality at the end only besmirches us. Worse still, there is clear evidence that Jihadists flourish where dictators rule. In supporting the PLO, what did we do to rid Gaza and the West Bank of Hamas in supporting Mubarak? What have we done to rid Egypt of the Muslim Brotherhood? Sixty years of rooting for the dictator’s stability, as my colleague Liz Cheney will make clear, didn’t protect us on 9/11. Our role must be to facilitate and educate, to hold open the door for democrats like Ayman Nour in Egypt. It should be to use our influence to see laws rescinded to stop the formation of new parties and constrain the grass roots activities of political and economic reformers. It should be to insure that mosques are not the only place where political parties and reformers can meet and it should be to insure that economic reforms go hand in hand with political change. Ultimately, when young men can expect unemployment in a thriving market economy, there will still be a few who are attracted to Al Qaeda – those medical students and those engineers. But the vast mass will not. They will be less attracted to the answers they hear from radical preachers. Or do our opponents here this evening really believe that reform is not possible, that reformers do not exist? No one among us has suggested the only way to prize open the closed doors of the Middle Eastern palaces is with Middle Eastern…is with Middle East – excuse me – military force. To the contrary – if that is our system it will fail. The same holds true for Al Qaeda. We cannot kill every Pakistani that tolerates an Al Qaeda operative in his midst. We cannot bomb houses of worship that preach Islamic politics and jihad. We can throw our considerable weight behind the people who do believe that rule of democracy – not jihad and bin Laden – offer real hope for the future. We may never do it perfectly but that is certainly not a reason not to do it at all. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Good evening. I think, uh, America should stand up for democracy and freedom. I think it should be an inspiring model, as it has been historically. What we shouldn't be doing is trying to pretend like we’re capable of making spreading democracy a top priority in a world in which we face many threats – and certainly not to do it by force. I think, if you look at what has happened over the past five years as a consequence of this policy of spreading democracy by force, is that we have a public and Arab world that doesn’t believe us: we have a gov…governments that don’t believe us: we have less democracy, more anarchy, more instability, more terrorism – and even worse, the growing American dependence on the very institutions and the very…very governments that need to be reformed. In essence, we have given democracy a bad name. It is hard for people in the region, including people who badly and desperately are looking for democracy and freedom, to think of democracy and freedom the American way without thinking about the horrors of Iraq. We have paid a price by diverting attention from the important issue of human rights, which we often confuse with spreading democratic systems. That issue which we should trump and advocate has paid a price as a consequence of this policy. Let me begin with some of the facts. The vast majority of people in the Arab world, all polls show, do not believe that we mean to spread democracy in the Middle East. Most of them believe that we’re in Iraq and in the region for oil, Israel and weakening the Muslim world. Even the governments who have faced pressures from us – and yes, they have faced pressures and, yes, they have been told to liberalize – all have believed that this is essentially tactical, that this is done in order to coerce them to cooperate on strategic issue or as a political domestic issue to divert attention from the absence of wea…uh, the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. And as a consequence, they dealt with it tactically. They said, The President needs a little political – give him a little election so he can say, I’ve got more democracy in Libya, I’ve got more democracy in, in Saudi Arabia. And then once he claims that he has a success -- he’s not gonna claim it as a failure the next day -and then you can go on with business. And look at the reality that we have at the moment. The vast majority of people in the Middle East – when you poll them – those people whom we’re supposed to be giving democracy to -- uh, the vast majority believe that the Middle East is less democratic today than it was before the Iraq War – less dramatic today than it was before Iraq War. And it was horribly undemocratic before the Iraq War, no doubt. And how is that the case? Is this simply made up by the media? Is this what people tell them? Is this what leaders tell them? I’m afraid there’s a little bit of reality to that and we now see it in many of the places that we celebrated early on as examples of democracy. Remember, the three big examples – Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestinian areas -- and you look at where we are in these areas. But separate from that there was some other dynamic that goes on that we are not coming to grips with – something that our policy does because in, in reality we are not making democracy our priority. And we, in essence, deceive ourselves when we think we are. Let me give you an example. Ninety per cent of the Arab public passionately opposed the Iraq War, didn’t want to see it take place. They told the governments, Don’t do it. It’s gonna bring about ruins. Their government’s instinct was, Don’t support the Iraq War. But when we went to the Iraq War -- these governments are certainly dependent on the U.S. -- in the end they came along and they provided logistical support and bases and everything else. And they were telling us that they’re worried about their public opinion. Well, we had, it was more important for us that they support our policies on terrorism, on Iraq, on the Arab/Israeli What happens in the process? How is the Jordanian government or the Egyptian government or the Saudi government going to face up with that pressure that comes from the public at a time of war? What they do is they unleash security services. Yes, they have elections -- and by the way, some of those elections we’ve had as little as twenty per cent and possibly only ten per cent of the public participating. It tells you how people, how seriously people took it. But in the end these governments became more repressive in order to quell, to, to, to put down any possible opposition, given the anger of the public. And this is essentially what we do, even in the war on terrorism. Who do we think our most important allies in these, uh, countries -- It’s not the Democrats. Yes, the Democrats we theoretically want to empower them. But who do we give most aid to? With whom do we institutionally cooperate – the security services who are embedded with our security services, the military, which are in bed with our military? These are the institutions of the repressions that need to be reformed. But those are the ones we have to deal with. And I’m not saying we don’t need to deal with them. We have to deal with them. But the reality of it is that the consequence is perpetuating repression, increasing it even as we pretend to be promoting it. Let me, just a couple of, make a couple of points to end. One is that I believe that all people in the world and all Arabs and all Muslims want to see freedom and democracy. No one likes dictatorship. And yes, you, I don’t think they want a different kind of democracy and freedom. When I ask them, uh, Name two countries where there’s most freedom and democracy for their people they name primarily Western countries – Western Europeans and the U.S. They know what democracy and freedom are. People aspire to it. But one thing they don’t want is they don’t want anarchy. They want anarchy even less than they democracy. And they want to see no occupation. They want freedom but they want to avoid anarchy and they want to avoid occupation. And when they see what is going on in Iraq, if a leader in Egypt looks at their citizen and say, Do you want Cairo or do you want Baghdad? I want Cairo over Baghdad any day of the week, with all the pain that people face every day. And that is the reality of how the choices are seen in the region. Let me end by saying I am not in harmony with the view that we –shouldn’t advocate democracy. I think we need to advocate democracy. But I believe that there is a better way. I think we should focus on those issues over which there is international consensus, like human rights. We should hold people responsible to treaties that they have signed and in order for us to be powerful in that regard we have to uphold our end of the bargain. We have to be an inspiring model, not just lecture to people while we have the Abu Ghraib prison. And we need to work in economic reform because that is the structure that enables true democracy to emerge from within. We’re treating Arab as a passive people that, that need to be told from the outside. No, they need empowerment from the outside – not manipulation. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Uh, there are clearly a number of issues that our opponents would like to debate tonight. And I, too, would welcome those debates. I would readily accept a debate on the topic, Was it Right for America to Go to War in Iraq? I would readily accept a debate on the topic, Is America Effectively Promoting Democracy in the Middle East? Or perhaps one on, How Accurate Are Opinion Polls in the Middle East? And I hope Intelligence Squared invites me back if they’re gonna have those debates. But those are not the issues before us tonight. Although I can understand why our opponents would rather discuss those issues than have to stand before you and argue against democracy. But make no mistake, their protestations aside, that is what they’re doing. The truth is that spreading democracy in the Middle East is not a bad idea nor is it a failed idea. Nor is it an idea that would have been good except that George W. Bush adopted it. It is, by any objective measure, a good idea, the right idea and a necessary policy choice for America today. Here are some facts: America is at war with an enemy driven by radical, ideological hatred to destroy us and all that we stand for. These terrorists were not created by U.S. policy. They are religious zealots who will stop at nothing in achieving their objective of establishing a global Caliphate in which individual lives have no value, women are chattel and the only legitimate faith is a perverted version of Islam. To accomplish their objectives, the terrorists or the trust fund terrorists – as my colleague Flynt has called them -- need recruits. Because the truth about the trust fund terrorists is they don’t do the dirty work themselves. They’ve got to find young men and women willing to strap bombs onto their bodies, detonate them, killing themselves and taking as many innocents with them as possible. For decades the terrorists have known that they can prey most effectively in societies where young people live in despair, where they have no hope for a better future here on earth – in societies that are characterized by brittle, autocratic regimes and closed status economic systems. For too many years America perpetuated this status quo. We supported those authoritarian regimes, we ignored the aspirations of their people. This policy, essentially the one that our opponents would have us return to tonight, brought only a false sense of security and stability. It is true that young people in the Arab world, as elsewhere, yearn for the freedom to be heard. They yearn to stand for something larger than self. They yearn to control their own destinies and choose their own leaders – and only democracy can fulfill those aspirations. Our opponents argue there is no evidence that democracy combats terror. To make this argument, you have to ignore the words of the terrorists themselves. If you read the captured letters of former Al Qaeda and Iraq Chief, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi -- who my colleague Dani Pletka quoted – you will see, in 2005 he wrote, quote: We have declared a bitter war against the principle of democracy and all those who seek to embrace it. The terrorists have done this because they know the fundamental truth – that people never choose to ru…be ruled by Al Qaeda or the Taliban. Those are the ideologies that must be imposed by force. Our opponents tonight also argue that supporting democracy is messy and that elections do not always turn out the way we would like them to. That is certainly true here in America, as well. But that is essentially an argument about how to effectively promote democracy, not one about whether promoting democracy is a bad idea. So let’s dispense with some straw men and agree on several things. Promoting democracy is not only about supporting elections. Elections are necessary but not sufficient and often they should come last in the reform process, not first. America’s democracy policy should and does include supporting freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, women’s rights and a thriving civil society. Asserting, as our opponents do, that somehow promoting democracy in the Middle East is an imperial imposition of American values requires ignoring two critical facts. The first is you have to ignore that the desire for freedom is a universal human desire. At its base this is an assertion, regardless of what they say, that only some people – maybe those of us fortunate enough to be born in the West – really desire human freedom. At least fifty per cent of our panel tonight is living evidence that that claim is not defensible. Our opponents’ position also requires ignoring the massive change underway in the Middle East today. Five or six years ago state dominated media, state press dominated the media in the region. Today there’s been an explosion of independent newspapers, television programming and access to the internet. Six years ago no woman had ever run for or voted in an election in the Gulf. Today they’ve done both. Six years ago a demo…and discussion about democracy in the Arab world would have brought ridicule and potentially jail time. Today leaders, reformers, journalists and millions of others are engaged in a constant ongoing debate and discussion about democracy. And America’s actions in this regard matter. As an Egyptian reformer said recently, When the outside world softens its call for reform regimes are emboldened to ignore their citizens’ rights. Knowing that we are on the side of those fighting for freedom empowers them and it strengthens them. Abandoning them or this cause would be unjust and unwise. In that regard, our opponents tonight need to answer this question: If you are truly concerned about America’s credibility and image in the Middle East, why are you willing to accept the grave damage that will be done to that credibility if America adopts your approach, if we return to the policy of support for autocrats and turn our backs on the aspirations of the, uh, Arab people? Finally, consider this: As we engage in this debate here tonight in Manhattan, a Saudi woman can sit in her home sixty-five miles, fifty-five hundred miles away. She can blog about her life, her fears, her oppression, her hopes and her aspirations. She can post that on the internet for all the world to read. She has a voice, probably for the first time in her life. If we were to tune in right now to any of the scores of Arabic satellite channels we would find young men and women from across the region debating the issues of the day, arguing and questioning authority. Adopting the path proposed by our opponents would be to betray those young men and women. Would our opponents have us tell young Arab men and women that America doesn’t believe they’re ready for democracy? Would they have us say to women across the Gulf that although they have been able, over the last few years, to vote and run for office, that was just temporary and America has now decided we won’t support their efforts any longer. Would they have us assert that we, in our ultimate wisdom, have decided that instead of supporting freedom fighters, we will throw America’s great and unparalleled strength behind autocrats and against the people? That surely is a world in which the terrorists have won. That is a world in which neither the terrorists nor the Americans support democracy and that is not a world in which I imagine many of us would like to live. Thank you."

    "data":"This was an interesting presentation. I never knew that I believed in all those things. But it’s always, you know, a learning experience, uh, particularly when you debate Bush Administration officials or many former administration officials. Your kind of plan, what you mean, what you sought and what you said. I don’t think that this was our position and I hope that you will make your own judgment, whether the previous presentation really reflected our side's. How can one be against democracy promotion? A very prominent American leader once said, It is our destiny to promote democracy worldwide because we cannot yield moral ground to repressive regimes because it would be unjust and wrong and because, also, it could be never secure as long as there are repressive regimes. Because they would not leave us alone and would continue to plot against us. Sorry, France, it was not a prominent American. It was Leon Trotsky.  And of course, he spoke not about promoting democracy but promoting proletarian revolutions. But he believed in proletarian revolutions very strongly. He was a sincere man. So were many Crusaders when they invaded the Middle East and you remember what has happened and what did it cost – to the Arabs, to the Christians, to the regions. Uh, we are not talking about our private beliefs. We are entitled to our beliefs. But democracy is not a religion. Democracy promotion should be policy. Therefore I will not hesitate to say that there are some things that are more important than democracy. If, uh, and then in 1930s, we knew what Hitler would do to the Jews and to the others, would we allow him to come to power democratically? Wouldn’t we consider stopping him a wise and honorable policy? And I completely agree with the Israelis now when they would not want to recognize democratically elected Hamas. And I do not care how many votes Hezbollah gets, but as long as they do what they do we should judge them not by the process to which they came to power, but what they’re doing to themselves, to others and what they present to the United States. I would yield to no one in my commitment to freedom. Freedom to select democracy for us and to freedom to allow others to make their own choices. I am touched by anecdotes about Arab women. I don’t need anecdotes when I hear about two and a half million Iraqi refugees – two and a half million, for whom in the name of democracy promotion we are doing almost exactly nothing. And more than a hundred thousand civilians who have died so far in Iraq and more dying. And our democracy promo…promoters don’t seem to be extremely concerned. There was a very prominent American who said, in 1964, that extremism in defense of freedom is no vice. His name was Barry Goldwater. I disagree. Extremism in the name of whatever is never a virtue. And extremism is never a sound policy. First about democracy as something that stop…stops wars – remember, the Peloponnesian War among the Greeks. More than twenty-five hundred centuries ago and there were democracies on both sides. Now, I just came from Washington. Who, uh, do you think burned Washington in 1812? My impression is that this was the British. And of course, they had a monarchy but they were very democratic by standards of the time. Now, more Americans have died in the Civil War than in any other war in American history. Would you disagree that the Confederacy was democratic – at least by the standard of the time? And what about the British in South Africa, fighting each other at the end of the 19th Century. Democracies do go to war against each other. Now, about democracy and terrorism – well, you know, I think that one of the most democratic countries I know is called Britain. And you see British born citizens engaging in the most vicious terror against their country. Well, you would say, but this may be terror imported. Well, about, what about the Basques in Spain? What about IRA and their long war against Britain? What about the Oklahoma City bomber? Come on, we know very well that there are many causes of terror. And to say that the absence of democracy in Saudi Arabia and Egypt really is responsible for September 11th -- you know, a claim like that has no scientific evidence whatsoever, is not based on interviews with the terrorists themselves. No senior CIA official who knows how these suspects were interviewed and what they said would ever claim that these people have attacked the United States because their Arab regimes were not democratic. People love freedom, I completely agree with that. But, you know, when people love freedom they may not only that they would be able to vote or even to enjoy free press or even, uh, freedom of religion or even that they would be able to travel. You know what they also mean? They mean that they want to be able to make their own choices, including to make their own mistakes. And that’s what the American Revolution was all about. And when the only remaining super power is coming to other countries and uses considerable American leverage and sometimes American military power telling them, Follow our indispensable guidance or else pay the price, then some people are unhappy. And people who are unhappy, are not just despots——and they’re not just some brainwashed people. India is the greatest democracy, in terms of numbers of people in India, and by now they have a long experience with democracy. And yet India is very strongly against democracy promotion. We should believe in democracy for ourselves, we should promote freedom of choice for others, but we should not presume that we know all the answers, and as the only remaining superpower, we should be the judge and the jury, however noble our intentions may be."

    "data":"You know, in life…a disadvantage can sometimes be advantage [sic]. Take being short. I can assure that in Soviet prison, being short was a huge advantage. And not only because punishment cells were very small. But because…the food is rationed. And clothes come in one size. So for tall people, they’re always hungry, and clothes simply doesn’t cover their body, and protect them from cold. But for people of my size, it was easier with hunger, and I always had an extra cloth, to cover myself, from the cold. And the winters are very cold in gulag. There we were praying for global warming. So…one can think that…living under totalitarian regime was a big disadvantage. Of course I’m very happy that my daughters were born in freedom. But, sometimes I really think, that having experience of living in a fear society, I have a big advantage. Because, I will never take freedom for granted. I will never think that the grass on the other side could be greener. I will never say what was said by one human rights, so-called human rights officer of the United Nations two years ago in Baghdad, when he was explaining why under Saddam Hussein it was better. He said, you know, under Saddam, if only you object, give away your freedom of thought and expression, you’re physically more or less okay. Now only the one who never had to give away his freedom of thought and expression can say such a thing. People who live in fear societies, have different perspective, of the advantages of democracy. And when they say democracy, exactly as all the colleagues who are against said, democracy’s not about elections. Stalin had elections. He did pretty well there. And Hitler not only had elections but as just now was said, he has opposition. He was elected democratically, but nobody would think that Third Reich is…a democracy. America’s strong democracy because, it has all these institutions of civil society, free press, independent courts, and so forth. Because…when I—when I’m speaking about democracy …the society which as I call, can pass the town square test--you can come to the center of your city. You can speak your mind, you can express your opinions, and you won’t be punished, you will not be harassed. That’s free society. So, is promoting free institutions of free society, like, free press, or, or independent opposition, independent courts, is promotion of these institutions result us a better year? Of course not. What, that’s, exactly what America was doing, when you defeated Germany, and Japan in the Second World War. You spent enormous efforts, economical, intellectual, financial, to support, to promote democracy, and today Japan and Germany is not a threat. Take Russia, when Russia was part of the totalitarian Soviet system, it was your worst enemy. When Soviet Union fell apart and Russia went towards freedom, it almost became your ally. Today, when freedom is then in retreat, in a big retreat, it becomes again a threat to America. And that is true about every part of the world. Take Venezuela, you take North Korea, you take Iran…what—whenever there is a threat to America is means that democracy is there, in retreat. If Middle East today is a dangerous place, it’s not because of democracy. It’s because in the last 60 years, when democracy was spread to Germany, and to Japan, and to Spain, and to Latin America, and to South Asia, and to Eastern Europe, and even to Russia, it was never spread to Middle East. And one can say, but you cannot impose democracy freedom from outside, of course you can’t impose freedom from outside. But, we find out that you can impose dictatorship from outside, simply by supporting dictators. And that’s unfortunately exactly what so many leaders of the free world were doing. They were supporting and they continued to support, royal Saudis. Ignoring the fact what’s happening there with the rights of even. They supported and continue to support…uh, au—au— authoritarian regime of Egypt. Ignoring the fact that practically every week, there is another human rights activist sent to prison. They were supporting Saddam Hussein, until the last day. Day before Saddam Hussein sent troops to Kuwait, leaders of Europe and United States of America believed that he was a good reliable partner, who can get stability. Decades before American President started speaking about promoting the freedom of the Middle East, Al Qaeda was born, that was already the place plagued with wars, with killing, and with repression. Was Middle East safer, before America started talking about promoting democracy. What is—was it safer in the ‘70s, when Jordan had to fight PLO and Syria, when Lebanon was almost destroyed with civil war, when Iranian re—regime in— emerged, and the American diplomats turned into refugees. Was Middle East more safe in the ‘80s, when the American airplane was blown up by, uh, Libya. When in Beirut and hundreds of American soldiers were killed. When one million citizens became victims, killed and wounded, in the war between Iran and Iraq. Has the Middle East been more safe in ‘90s, when Kuwait was sw—swallowed up, by Iraq. When missiles were fired—falling on Tel Aviv and Riyadh. When twin towers survived…the first attack of the terrorists. And when Al Qaeda published its famous fatwa, about killing Americans. Promoting democracy in the Middle East is an excellent idea, by the way I, I idea that it has to be connected with human rights. That the policy of the free world has—in the Middle East has to be connected with the question of human rights, that’s exactly what I was promoting for all my years. Unfortunately, all the administrations of the United States of America in the ‘70s and the ‘80s and the ‘90s, never did it. Promoting democracy in the Middle East is an excellent idea, that’s very—the thing is, how. It’s very difficult to overcome the resistance of all those who don’t want democracy there. And that’s a very important question. But it’s not the question which we are discussing today, till this day the question which is discussed is, whether it is good idea or not. The march of freedom, ladies and gentlemen, is very difficult. It will not succeed in one day. But there is no alternative. Great struggles between those who on one side, those millions, hundreds of millions in the Middle East, who want freedom, and those who want to deprive them of freedom. The problem is that sometimes we forget on whose side we are. The globe was blessed, and I personally was blessed, with America for—which always knew on what side it is. America which knew that, this divide between free world and fear societies, is much more important than divide between Republicans and Democrats, between this and that party. America which knew that ideal freedom…is bigger than any president, any party, any country."

    "data":"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. In life, when we fail, we call it stupidity to burrow deeper into failure. Measured by any standard, American policy toward Israel has failed over the past couple of decades. We are no closer to any kind of peace. Israelis and Palestinians today stand further apart than ever. They are estranged. They are mistrustful. They are antagonistic. They can scarcely even imagine peace. We will therefore submit to you tonight that rather than burrowing deeper into failure, and so jeopardizing American interest, the United States should reconsider its ties with Israel. It should step back from its special relationship in favor of a normal relationship. Now a normal relations between allies, and the United States and Israel must remain firm allies, are often marked by differences. With France, with Japan, with Germany, with Turkey, important allies all, America has regular and often open disagreements. What makes America's relationship with Israel is its uncritical nature, even when U.S. interests are being hurt. What also makes the relationship special is the incredible largess that the United States shows towards Israel, over the past decade, $28.9 billion in economic aid. And on top of that, another $30 billion in military aid, that's almost $60 billion. That's 10 times the GNP of Haiti that is being gifted to a small country. Now, I ask you, to what end is this money being used. Ladies and gentlemen, we would submit that it ends often inimical to the America interest. Take the ongoing Israeli settlement program in the West Bank, at a cost of about $100 billion, this enterprise has grown the number of settlers in the West Bank from about 140,000 in 1996, to about 300,000 today. If you add the roughly 150,000 Israeli's in East Jerusalem, you get to a number of 450,000 Israelis beyond the 1997 border. That's not all. Money has poured into a repressive apparatus involving settler-only highways, reserved military areas, a separation or security barrier. The Israelis call it separation wall, hated separated wall the Palestinians call it, a barrier that burrows into the West Bank and annexes 10% of the land. What's the result of this? Well the result is an isolated, fragmented, atomized, fractured, humiliated Palestinian presence that simply makes a nonsense, at first, of the notion of Two States for Two Peoples. What I observe there on my visits to the West Bank amounts to a kind of primer in colonialism. Imagine, Israelis in their fast cars, Blackberry-ing away, booming down these super highways, while Palestinians on their donkey carts make their way on dirt tracks, if they can get there, to their orchards. This is a primer in colonialism, much more than it resembles a nascent Palestinian state. Yet, Two States for Two Peoples is the declared U.S. objective. In effect, the United States is bankrolling the very Israeli policies that are dashing its own aims and the hopes for Oslo by making two states almost unimaginable. Does this make sense? Is that clever? I don't think so. And if you don't think so, ladies and gentlemen, you should vote for the proposition tonight. Now, the United States has raised its voice occasionally. Jim Baker, for example, Secretary of State in '89, said, Foreswear annexation. Stop settlement activity. Now fast forward two decades to Barack Obama, in Cairo, two decades in several hundred thousand settlers, he said, The United States does not accept legitimacy of the continued Israeli settlements. And what did Prime Minister Netanyahu do two weeks ago, planted settlings in various settlements, and they are part - and said, They are part of Israel for all eternity. Now in a normal relationship, there would be consequences to such defiance. In a special relationship, the one that exists, there are no such consequences. Now, America's perceived complicity in Israeli violence carries a heavy price. Jihadi terrorism aimed at the United States is not primarily motivated perhaps by the Palestinian issue, but it is a major factor. It is a potent terrorist recruitment tool. The United States should stand by its allies. And Israel is an ally. But if America is to pay the blood, and the treasure, and the last piece of mind that comes with supporting Israel, it should be ready at least to speak openly and critically of Israeli mistakes when needed. To boost, ladies and gentlemen, are unhealthy, a climate that affixes charges of anti-Semitism to anyone critical of Israel, and self-hating Jew to any Jew who's critical of Israel, is unhelpful. For if there are not two states, there will be one state. And sooner or later, the number of Palestinians in it will outnumber the number of Jews. And what then will remain of the Zionist dream? Ladies and gentlemen, there's also a moral issue here. I am a Jew. I know that Israel at its foundation and its declaration of independence said it would, Ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants, irrespective of religion, race, and sex. We, Jews, know in our bones what persecution is. Alas, and this is hard to say, Israel, has in my view, lost touch with these fundamental values. By uncritically supporting Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza, America is undermining its own values, which at the very least stand for the absence of second class citizenship and equality of opportunity. Yes, I know Israel's a vibrant democracy isolated in the Middle East. And its values are closer to ours than those at closed Arab societies. But that does not mean that we should endorse Israel's systematic dismemberment of the Two State option. And if President Obama is serious about reaching out to the Muslim world, America must appear much more as an honest broker and less as Israel's spokesman. And that requires a serious re-balloting. You will, I suspect, hear that Israel is a lonely David facing an Arab Goliath. You will hear that it needs blanket American support to be secure. This is simply not true. Nuclear-armed Israel is powerful. The United States can step back while ensuring Israel's security. And so I urge you to vote for the motion tonight. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you, John. I couldn't disagree more with Roger Cohen, and strongly oppose the notion that the United States should somehow stand back from its special relationship with Israel, and I do so for the following reasons. First, if the United States would do so, it would betray the very principles upon which U.S. foreign policy is based. Unlike China, or Russia, or some of our European allies, our foreign policies since our founding founders have never been to avoid a morality. Indeed, morality is a central feature of our policy. As a first country to recognize Israel in 1947 after the Holocaust as a refuge for Jews, we would be betraying those principles were we to step back from the special relationship we've developed over 62 years. Second, it would mean abandoning the only democratic, loyal, reliable ally in the region, which shares American values of democracy, rights for women, judicial independence, freedom of speech, and forming a 21st century culture. It's the only state in the region, which has a vibrant non-governmental sector so good on policies that Roger mentioned. There are groups like Peace Now, B’Tselem, and others who are vibrantly and publicly opposing those policies, the only country in the region which permits that kind of debate and criticism of the government. In addition, it's not just American values, it is American interest. Israel shares American interest in combating terrorism, in creating pro-Western moderate Arab states in the region, in stopping nuclear proliferation, and in having peace with all of its neighbors. In addition, if we were to withdraw that special relationship, it would be a sign of American inconstancy and weakness. What message would it send to other allies? Would they think they were going to be next on the chopping block? And indeed, to do so would only lead to more demands from those in the region. America has to stand behind its allies because if it doesn't, it will not have many left anywhere. In addition, the whole notion of this motion misunderstands the major issues facing the United States in the region. And I have spent an enormous amount of time and energy in that region in multiple capacities. Issues that we have with Iraq and Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran, terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda are unrelated to our special relationship with Israel. Indeed, what is going on fundamentally in these states is a contest internally within the Arab world between modernizing states and radical Islamic states who want to create an Islamic caliphate for the whole region, unrelated to Israel, unrelated to Israel. It's also auspicious argument that somehow there's a zero-sum game that the kind of outreach that President Obama properly is providing to the Muslim world is somehow inconsistent with a special relationship with Israel. And let me tell you from personal knowledge, there is no zero-sum game. We can, and do have, both. We have a very close relationship. And I spent a lot of time in countries like Egypt and in Jordan, and in the territories, and in the Gulf helping build that relationship. And indeed, let me point out that it is because of the special relationship with Israel that the Arab states know that the way in which Israel will make concessions is when it has a dependable American ally so that it can make those territorial concessions. And I've seen it happen at Camp David under President Carter, all of Sinai given back. I've seen it happen with Jordan and the peace agreement with Jordan. Roger says there's been no peace. I mean, I don't know where you've been. How about the Egyptian peace, which has lasted now for over 30 years, and the Jordanian peace? And those concessions continued. For example, Prime Minister Barack in the Clinton administration, in which I served at the second Camp David, offered 95% of the land, including East Jerusalem, to Yasser Arafat. And what was the response? No, that's where the second intifada occurred. What was the response when Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza? What was the response? Rockets from Gaza, dismantling the settlements, dismantling 3,000 people, and that was the response. So it is auspicious argument that we can only have good relations with the Muslim world if we abandon Israel. Indeed, they know we need to have that relationship to convince Israel to make those concessions. In addition, where else will one have a special relationship and with whom else? The Saudis? The Saudis who export Wahabanism as well as expensive oil from whom 17 of the 19 9/11 terrorists came? Would it be Egypt where I've spent a great deal of time? I think we need stronger relations with Israel. It's on forth with Egypt. It's a one-party state, 28 years the same president. The opposition candidate was arrested when he ran against Mr. Mubarak. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, where is the special relationship? And let me close with this thought, when you say, Why don't we have peace with the Palestinians? If there were a Martin Luther King, if there were a Mahatma Gandhi leading the Palestinian movement, they would have had statehood long, long, long ago. It is because there is no reliable Palestinian partner. It is because of the Hamas-Fatah problem. It is because when the Israeli public sees a withdrawal from Lebanon or a withdrawal on their own from Gaza, instead of reconciliation, they get rockets in response. That's why we don't have peace, not because Israel doesn't want peace. And last, there are certain things with which we disagree with Israel as we do with all allies, settlement policy and so forth. I didn't notice, for example, that Germany, or the UK, or France is providing the kind of troops we want in Afghanistan. You can have a special relationship with allies and not always agree. Therefore, I strongly urge you to vote against this pernicious motion, which would undercut the very basis of foreign policy in the United States. The only bipartisan foreign policy which we have in this country. Thank you."

    "data":"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for braving the impending snowstorm. You've heard from our opponents, one of our opponents, a pattern that we've heard a great deal of. And if you listen to the advocates of the special relationship with Israel, you would think that all is for the best and the best of all possible worlds. Well I'm here to tell you that it's not. You heard from my colleague, Roger, exactly how bad the situation is. I strongly recommend the next time any of you have a chance to go to the Holy Land, that you take a little time away from your trip to Israel and spend some time in the West Bank, spend three or four days. And you will see precisely how bad it is. Now, I would be the last person, as a Middle East historian, to suggest that all the problems in the Middle East are caused by the U.S. special relationship with Israel. They're not. There are problems with Arab governments. There are problems among the Palestinians. There are problems inside Israel. But some problems are caused by this special relationship. Let me just list a couple of them. One of them is that there is, as a result in large measure of our special relationship with Israel, an almost total deafness to public opinion in Palestine and in the Arab world. We hear the same kind of mantra about there's no democracy, there's no public sector. There are all kinds of things going on in public opinion in the Arab world. And one of the things that's going on is a deep distrust and unease with U.S. policy over this issue in particular. A second thing that has to be said is that there is a suspicion, in public opinion in particular all over the Arab world, of the fact that the United States in the Middle East because of this special relationship is not and cannot be an honest broker. Everybody knows that the United States engages in prior coordination with Israel, as a result of an agreement made by Secretary Kissinger back in the 70s, before anything starts between Arabs and Israelis. Everybody knows, in other words, that there's a big fat U.S. thumb on the scales when the United States act as a mediator. I recall, in the negotiations in Washington, we were in an impasse with the Israeli side, and we were told, after much reluctance on their part, that the State Department of the United States would come with a bridging proposal. We were very pleased. They came with a bridging proposal that was worse than the position that the Israelis had offered us. This is what the special relationship gives you. It gives you a country that cannot act as an honest broker. And let me say something about United States reliability. Let me say something about what the United States looks like after 20 years when American presidents, since President Carter, have said not just that they were going to make peace with Egypt, which they did, but that they were going to make peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis. We have systematically failed in this effort over the past 20 years. The situation is - 30 years in fact. The situation is infinitely worse today than when Ambassador Rabinovich and I went to Madrid in October of 1991. It's worse for the Palestinians. It's worse for the position the United States in the Arab world if you care not what autocratic governments think, but what the people think about us. And this brings me to the main reason you should vote for this proposition. You should vote for this proposition, in our opinion, because the United States should be true to its principles. It should be fair. It should be equitable. It should be just. We give, as Roger said, $60 billion over the past 10 years to Israel. We are in effect engaged in supporting an occupation that has been going on for 42 years and counting. We are in effect underwriting settlements. And we're not just using that with U.S. money that's fund - U.S. tax dollars out of our pockets that's fungible. We are doing that with tax deductible contributions to settlements, to projects in the occupied West Bank, and essentially to doing things that are directly opposed to United States policy and to the interest of the United States not to speak of the interest of peace in the Middle East. We hear a great deal about security whenever Israel is talked about. We have to be concerned with Israel's security. Fine, we have to be concerned with the security of everybody in this region if we are going to be an honest broker, if some people are not of a higher importance to us than other people. What about the security of Palestinians? In the recent war in Gaza, it wasn't really a war. It was a one-sided affair. There were 14,000 people killed on one side and 14 on the other side. If we're concerned with human security, we should be concerned with numbers like this. We should be concerned with the fact that everybody knows that we are engaged not just in funding, financing, supporting diplomatically, but also in selling weapons that are engaged in doing these kinds of things. Now what can the United States do? In my view, it can do many things. It's not enough to say, Oh, it's a shame. The Palestinians are divided. The Palestinians are divided. They have deep, deep internal divisions. The United States has been working systematically to deepen those divisions. The United States should be helping to unite the Palestinians around a consensus whereby they can come forward and negotiate, rather than trying to keep them divided as we've been trying to do if our objective is not to weaken them, which is an Israeli objective. If our objective is peace, then there has to be not just an Israeli consensus for peace, there has to be a Palestinian consensus for peace. We have done everything possible to prevent this. This is one thing that we can and should do. What else can we do? I would argue that our policy should be linked not solely to what the stronger party - by far the stronger party in this relationship wants. That is no way to make peace. Again and again, what the United States has an effect done is to help gang up on the Palestinians. The United States has to pull away from this special relationship with Israel if it is to play any kind of effective role in making peace. Now, this is particularly true because the hardest issues between the Palestinians and the Israelis, much harder than anything that had to be dealt with between Israel and Jordan or Israel and Egypt have to do with issues that resonate all over the Arab world, things like refugees, things like Jerusalem. These are not easy issues. If we stand with the stronger, as we have done consistently on these and other issues, if we stand with Israel and ignore the fact that these are not just things on which there's a claim on both sides, but most importantly, these are things that will negatively affect U.S. interests. If we take a one-sided position, we are harming U.S. interests throughout the region. If you vote against this proposition, I would argue, you are voting for the status quo. You are voting for more of the same. You are voting for a peace process that has delivered a lot of process and no peace. And that is what we have gotten from every administration up to this point. We have peace with Egypt. We have with Jordan. Peace with the Palestinians is much farther away. I would suggest that voting for this status quo is to say in effect, We're going to bury our heads in the sand. We're going to allow a Two States solution to disappear. I personally don't think it has very many changes anymore. But if this is something that is important, if we do not want the future for Israel that many Israelis see, where Israel continues to rule over the Palestinians, we should vote in favor of this proposition. Thank you very much."

    "data":"Thank you. I urge you strongly to vote against the motion. I think that the motion indicates a desire to destroy the United States' most important, most successful relationship in a very important part of the world. What does special relationship mean? It does not mean that the tail is wagging the dog.It is a mutual relationship. I was an ambassador to Washington for nearly four years. I was a peace negotiator that worked very closely with the United States peace team. And I know how many disagreements we have had over the years with our American colleagues. How many times, what we call, pressure was brought to bear on Israeli decision makers, even presidents who were considered very friendly. Bill Clinton, considered a great friend of Israel, he was a close friend of Yitzhak Rabin. He admired Rabin, but I've seen them argue fiercely. And I've seen Rabin yield to Clinton because he was the President of the United States, the senior partner in this special relationship. Now, what is special about the relationship? It's special. It's unique because you have unusual loyalty on both sides. We have many relationships around the world as we have mentioned. Israel relationship with France is so close. Doesn't France undermine U.S. interests and policies in parts of the world? Japan is a close ally, look at the arguments you're having with Japan over stationing of U.S. troops in Japan. You will not have such an argument with Israel because there are no U.S. troops stationed in Israel. It's a very close military and strategic alliance defined, among other things, by the fact that Israel does not want American troops to be stationed in Israel. Israel wants to look out for its own security with American help, with American weapons and equipment, but on its own, and not having to station troops in Israel or in that part of the Middle East because Israel is there, it's a huge advantage. Because look at the other side of the Middle East, an important part of the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, countries that are of enormous influence or importance for the United States. You have troops there. You have many American troops at a huge cost in Iraq. You have troops in Afghanistan. You have troops stationed in Saudi Arabia. And remember, what did the Al- Qaeda terrorists say once they exploded into the World Trade Center, the first reason they cited for the U.S. - for attacking the U.S. is that the United States has troops on sacred Muslim soil in the Arabian peninsula. In Israel or near Israel, you don't need to station U.S. troops. It's a very close alliance. It's an alliance based on mutuality, on a full loyalty on both sides, acceptance of, of course, the seniority of the United States in that relationship. And this relationship serves you in an area in which many American interests are focused. Now, the argument of the people who put this for a vote, the argument of our opponents in this debate is that support to Israel undermines American position in our republic opinion and reinforces Arab and Muslim tendency to terrorism against the United States. Wrong. What the Arabs resent most is, that is American military presence, American support for dictatorial regimes. Let me read a very perceptive comment written awhile ago. Iraq has changed everything in Washington, the city obsessed with the President. It was easy to forget that as recently as a few years ago, the United States was not particularly disliked in the Middle East, and that Al-Qaeda was a tiny underground organization with almost no popular support, very perceptive professor Khalidi who wrote these lines. So we are in agreement on a few things but we take different conclusions from that. So another complaint that I have against our opponents in this debate, first of all too much was focused on the Palestinian issue. It's very important issue, it's important first and foremost for us. I'm one of those Israelis who desperately believe in fight for having a two state solution. I think it's dangerous for Israel to keep the states poor. Now there are people in Israel who think otherwise and politically we disagree. In the United States and this Government of Israel do want to see a two state solution. But the President problem is not the only one. He said there is peace with Egypt, there is peace with Jordan and normal relations with quite a few Arab countries and that has been achieved by the United States precisely as my colleague Stu Eizenstat said, because the United States is the power, the great power that has the ability to influence to work with Israel. And Arab countries who want to see a change. Syria if it wants the Golan back knows that their road to the Golan leads to Washington, not through Tehran. So, actually the closest to Israel, the perception in the Arab world that the United States has that sway with Israel is one of the most important assets that United States has. And believe me I spent hundreds of hours talking to the Syrians as the peace negotiator with Syria, and I know exactly full well. They wanted to make peace with Israel because that was a pathway to Washington. They work with Washington, you know, that to make peace with Israel. Finally much of what you heard from our opponents earlier this evening was actually in the frame of the Bush years. We are not in the Bush years any more. For year there has been another administration in Washington and actually what we have seen it was President Obama who listened to such advice and begun by taking some distance from Israel. He went to Cairo; he gave the speech to the Muslim world. He didn't go to Israel. What is the result, the result is the current impulse. It was a mistake to take even one step, because the voices that we heard from the Arab world was you took one step go all the way, that is a mistake. So the policy should be stay with the special relationship with Israel and together with Israel, use it in order to make peace with the Middle East including with the Palestinians."

    "data":"Thank you very much. I will argue that stress interrogation techniques are both necessary for getting information from suspected terrorists after 9-11, and effective in doing so. I will base my arguments on the actual experience of interrogators in Afghanistan and elsewhere. This is not a debate about torture. The stress methods that interrogators developed, such as short periods of sleep deprivation and isolation, were light years from torture. And to call them such, degrades the moral opprobrium that rightly attaches to the term. As my colleagues will demonstrate, the use of stress techniques on terrorists is lawful. The burden therefore falls on our opponents, to explain why legal and essential methods to gain critical information about future terrorist attacks should be off-limits. It didn’t take long for interrogators working in Afghanistan, to realize that the traditional army interrogation techniques were nearly useless against the Al Qaeda operatives and Taliban fighters whom the military was picking up in the fall of 2001. Those traditional techniques, a set of 16 psychological gambits assembled during the Cold War, were designed to help young Americans, soldiers, debrief Soviet prisoners of war on the battlefield. The 16 gambits have been crafted for use against conventional soldiers, lowly grunts, conscripted into a state army, who are often only too glad to be taken off the battlefield and out of the war. Army lore held that 95 percent of lawful prisoners of war would divulge information upon direct questioning. In Afghanistan, this ratio was reversed. Virtually none of the terror detainees was giving up information. Tried-and-true approaches, like appealing to a prisoner’s love of family, often had little purchase. If an interrogator offered a jihadist prisoner contact with his wife or children, in exchange for information, the jihadist might respond, quote, “I’ve divorced this life. I don’t care about my family,” end quote. Unlike lawful prisoners of war, the terror detainees were never off the battlefield. They continued their vicious attacks against their captors at every opportunity while in detention. Some of the detainees had been trained in resistance techniques, and knew the limits of American interrogation rules. Others quickly learned what those limits were. So the interrogators began cautiously experimenting with stress techniques, such as marathon questioning sessions or aggressive behavior, to put a detainee on edge. The purpose of such methods was to recreate the shock of capture, that vulnerable mental state immediately following capture, when a prisoner is most frightened, uncertain, and likely to give up information. Uncertainty is an interrogator’s most powerful ally. It can lead the detainee to believe that the interrogator is in total control, and holds the key to his future. An interrogator facing a resistant Taliban explosives-maker, for example, might angrily hoist the prisoner up by his collar, and storm out of the interrogation booth. The detainee had previously understood that American interrogators couldn’t so much as lay a finger on them. Suddenly, he doesn’t know what the interrogator’s limits are. That frightening uncertainty can change his calculations about whether to cooperate. According to interrogators in—in Afghanistan and Guantanamo, stress worked. The harsher the methods that the questioners used, the sooner they got good information. Eventually, the military codified a set of stress techniques for use in Guantanamo and Iraq. These included keeping a detainee awake at night, putting him on cold Army rations instead of hot meals, isolation, environmental manipulation, and impersonating a foreign agent. All were hedged round with numerous bureaucratic and medical safeguards. None of the stress techniques that the military approved for use on terror detainees had anything to do otherwise with Abu Ghraib. Abu Ghraib was the result of the unconscionable and culpable breakdown of military discipline, throughout the detention camp. Soldiers sprayed graffiti on the walls, engaged in public sexual misbehaver, and operated bootlegging and prostitution rings. Elliot Spitzer is not known to have used any of them. The guards’ sadistic and sexualized treatment of prisoners was an extension of the chaos they were already wallowing in. It had nothing to do with interrogation. Had the rules for prisoner treatment and questioning been followed at Abu Ghraib, the abuse couldn’t have happened. In conclusion, the stress interrogation techniques that interrogators developed to break detainees’ resistance, were necessary, effective, and lawful. They were far from torture. In certain instances as—as Bob said, they resembled what army recruits and professionals go through as part of their training. As a reality check, here’s the Senate’s definition of torture. It is that barbaric cruelty which lies at the top of the pyramid of human rights misconduct—such as sustained systematic beating, application of electric currents to sensitive parts of the body, and tying up or hanging in positions that cause extreme pain. It would be reckless to ignore the experience of interrogators on the ground, who came up against detainee resistance that was potentially catastrophic in consequence. Intelligence about terror planning is our only sure defense against attack. Nothing else matters. Interrogators facing the urgent need to get life-saving information from terrorists with likely knowledge of future plots, should be allowed to use stress when the questioning techniques designed for lawful prisoners of war are not working. Thank you."

    "data":"Thank you. Gee, it all sounds so…sweet and benign. Uh…ask ‘em a few questions, have ‘em stand up for a while, you know…make them take their shirt off, get ‘em a little cold maybe. 300-pound Iraqi general… stuffed in—head-first—into a sleeping bag, bound up with electrical wires, sat on by a Army warrant officer… Hand put over his face every time he screamed out for Allah… Released, put back in, died. Dead. That was a stress position. Guy was prosecuted, got six months for some orders violations, but, basically, was released because it was an authorized stress position. Taxi driver Dilawar, hung from the ceiling, by his wrists. Five days after he’s—not captured, but turned over, turned over, to American forces in exchange for a ransom, beaten to a point where, according to the autopsy, by an Army doctor, his legs are pulpified. Dead. By the DOD’s own count, approximately 40 people have been killed in the hands of the United States, in detention, as homicides. So let’s not kid ourselves that this is some sort of benign search for the truth. Torture was never intended to be that. Torture was intended originally, to be an effort to get false confessions. You’re a heretic, you’re a traitor to the king, you’re a witch. We’ve given a bad name to torture. We’ve misapplied torture, we’re trying to use it to find the truth, for Pete’s sake. My experience has been, in doing these kinds of things and these—with these kinds of groups, that there are a number of people who have a number of different points of view about it. Some of you are moved by history, tradition…some of you are moved by the morality of it, the moral imperative. Some of you are moved by diplomacy. Some of you are simply moved by the practicality of it. Are there better methods, or is this the best method. What I want to do is address six aspects of torture, or, benign interrogation, whatever you want to call it, stuffing people in sleeping bags head first and binding them up, and then give each of you the opportunity to pick the one that you kind of think works, and then my colleagues will hone in on some of them. First one is that it inflames, enrages the enemy, and causes them not to surrender. There’s a reason the Nazis surrendered to the Americans on the Eastern front and not to the Russians. In the first Iraq war, tens of thousands of Iraqis surrendered to us because they knew that they would be treated decently. My friends, they’re not surrendering to us anymore. It endangers our own troops. We’re the ones on the front lines. It’s the—it’s US troops at the pointy end of the spear, forward-deployed in more locations on more occasions in greater numbers than all the other forces of this world combined. There is a reason that the United States wanted there to be a Geneva Convention, it wasn’t to protect them from us, it was to protect us from them. And we’ve lost that. John McCain said, that he believes he was treated incrementally better because the Vietnamese knew—North Vietnam knew—that we were abiding by the Geneva Conventions in spite of the fact we didn’t have to. According to the arguments, based on the same rationale that the administration uses now. It interferes with our ability to build coalitions, in the future wars are gonna be fought by coalition forces. The United States should not and cannot go alone. We were just put on the list of human-rights violators by Canada. We got them to take us off, but the point is…Canada, the Aussies, the Brits, aren’t going to want to fight with us if they can’t expect us to comply with the Geneva Conventions, and we’re going to be out there at the pointy end of the spear, all by our lone. It causes Americans to become torturers. It’s one thing for us to send our good men and women into battle and ask them to give that last full measure of devotion. It’s another thing to send them into battle and ask them to become torturers and come home that way. Fifthly, it’s simply not the most effective method. People say, Does torture work?” Torture-, does torture work isn't the right question. The question is, is there another more effective way to do it. Let me quote to you from, say, General Petraeus, who one would think would know something about it. Some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy. They would be wrong. Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal, tort history shows that they are frequently neither useful nor necessary. The fight depends on securing the pop-, boy, that went fast. got into this. The fight depends on securing the populations, which must understand that we, not our enemies, occupy the high moral ground. And then finally, and I’d like to return to this, because I think it’s, if I get another chance, I think it’s the most important issue. This is an asymmetric war. In an asymmetric war you want to, you want to pit your greatest strength against the enemy’s greatest weakness. Fortunately, in this war, that works for us, if we will do it. Because our greatest strength is our ideas and our ideals. The enemy is completely bereft of ideas and our-, and ideals. Thomas Paine said in 1776, The cause of America is the cause of all mankind.” Several hundred years later, that great geopolitical commentator Bono said America isn't just a country, it’s an idea."

    "data":"The critics invariably portray, as you just heard now, waterboarding and other stress techniques as torture. I would stipulate easily and readily that waterboarding and other stress techniques is a fairly unpleasant practice. It offends our 21st century sensibilities. It’s something that’s difficult to talk about. But I also believe we’re at war with an implacable and ruthless foe that thinks nothing about killing civilians by the thousands and is seeking to kill millions more. I don't think anybody would disagree about obtaining intelligence is vital in this war. And we can debate, theoretically, the proposition that other techniques work, but it’s a matter of fact. There are instances where hardened anti-operatives did not prove susceptible to these kinder, gentler techniques, and yet provided intelligence when they were subjected to stressful interrogation techniques. But my overarching message to you is that this is a policy debate. It should be a policy debate, which is why asking the question that has been posed today is useful. The obsession of legalities is not helpful. The legal definition of torture is necessarily vague. The torture defined in the ’94 statute which was passed to implement obligations under an anti-torture convention, as quote, Intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, both physical and mental.” Much of the legal debate about torture boils down to the question of how severe is severe. As far as the physical pain and suffering is concerned, it’s almost certainly the case that some forms of waterboarding have been practiced by the CIA on only three occasions that we know of, with three different high-value detainees, rise to the level of torture. And some probably, particularly those that did not involve full inundation of the subject do not. The reason for this is because the physical discomfort suffered by the subject of-, being subjected to this technique while was not severe enough. As far as the mental severe pain and suffering is concerned, it bears emphasizing that Congress deliberately adopted a narrow definition of the term severe” to encompass only, and I quote, prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from the threat of imminent death or mind altering substances.” In my view waterboarding and other techniques practiced by the CIA do not fit this definition for at least two reasons. First of all, the practice of waterboarding used by the CIA was extremely short, sixty to ninety seconds, which certainly suggests even to our lawyer that it’s not protracted. Significant to the question of what is, what constitutes protracted was further debated by Congress in 2005 and 2006 in the context of two key pieces of legislation when Congress handled-, and once again, the answer was that there has to be some duration, some timeline for something to be considered protracted. Second, the high-value terrorist being interrogated are perfectly aware that they’re not in any danger of death, that the CIA was after information, their lives were not in danger. When Congress passed in the Detainee Treatment Act something called shocks the conscience standard”, which makes it even harder to argue that these techniques are always, inherently, and absolutely torture, because the shock, shocks the conscience standard, by definition-- and it’s something that borrows from American case law-- it is inherently a contextspecific standard. It is not something that you would be able to answer in the abstract. It’s also worthy to point out that while the original Justice Department so-called torture memo” was perhaps overly broad in its definition of what level of pain and suffering constitutes torture, lots of legal council came up with some more nuanced analysis. Significantly, ladies and gentlemen, this analysis was developed by lawyers, at least some of whom where critical of the administration’s policy. Indeed, as reported in the media, including by Stuart Taylor of the National Journal, the lead author of the subsequent memo by OLC on this issue was none other than senior DOJ official Daniel Levin, who himself had been subjected to waterboarding as a part of his research. I know that trusting the gallowman is not an argument most of you like these days, but I would certainly be inclined to trust Dan Levin, who by the way was reportedly forced out by Alberto Gonzales for not being sufficiently solicitous of the White House positions on various other issues. Now, presented with this argument, the critics claim, Well maybe it’s not torture, but maybe it’s cruel inhuman degrading treatment”, which is another set of legal buzzwords. Yet cruel, inhuman and degrading are even more capacious terms than torture. For some detainees, the mere fact that they’re being questioned by a Jew or a woman is an intolerable humiliation. Are we supposed to countenance and approve this kind of racist sentiment? Meanwhile, it’s also the case that there has to be some reasonable definition of what is cruel, inhuman and degrading, because I would submit to you that there is a degree of humiliation, cruelty, and degradation in any kind of custodial interrogation. There’s yelling, there’s screaming. Threats are being made against a person or his loved ones. Andy Fastow of Enron fame was told by his interrogators that his wife would be imprisoned for a long time, and I would submit to you that it was probably a cruel treatment. So there has to be some parameters of behavior that’s clearly-, is cruel and degrading and humiliating, but yet does not violate the law. My bottom line is this: while the waterboarding debate implicates legal issue, we cannot simply abandon the field to the lawyers. The lawyers have no special right or expertise to deal with those issues. So our duty as a society is to approach these debates seriously, in a mature fashion. To ask what is really consistent with our values. Incidentally, we’ve talked about mistakes. My good friend John mentioned mistakes. And yes, shoving somebody’s head in a sleeping bag is not a good thing. But as you may recall, these problems occur in other contexts. When I was at the Justice Department, one of my responsibilities was investigating various bad things that happened in the Bureau of Prisons. And let me assure you ladies and gentlemen, in a situation when there is no blessing for stress techniques, instead in fact-- prisoners in federal and civil and state penitentiaries not being interrogated at all have……fellow prisoners who commit horrible things. You have sadistic guards who do horrible things. Recently I had a case in Florida…involving mistreatment by the guards of a child in a boot camp, where he was basically smothered and suffocated in the course of trying to set him straight. This is not an easy debate. We should not focus exclusively on the question of how to deal with enemy combatants. We should ask a broader set of questions of what level of coercion are we prepared to tolerate in our public policy, something that our government is doing. We should not come up with one set of regimen for captured unlawful enemy combatants when we waterboard our own personnel. Then there are things going on other spheres of public life, including as I mentioned, in boot camps that are harsh. And--, but the last point is whatever we do, we should be honest and transparent about this debate. We should not use misdirection. We should not talk in terms of, Well let’s adopt the same standards as an Army field manual.” Because ladies and gentlemen, the Army field manual, by the way, allows the level of Mutt and Jeff” technique that does not allow the interrogator playing the bad cop to be disrespectful, to be tough on an individual. So here we have politicians advocating the level of kindness towards the unlawful enemy combatants that exceeds that that’s been adopted with regard to interrogation of criminal suspects. That is not…the good way to deal with this issue. Thank you."

    "data":"All of us on both sides want good counterterrorism policy. Heather, David, John, all of us want to be safe. They just represent different fears. I’m here to represent the facts, not their fears. I have been working for 30 years on torture, on nottorture, and everything I’m about to say is in that 900-page book in the lobby. Bottom line, good torture is not good counter-terrorism policy. As the fascist military police said, torture for interrogation is, and I quote, the clumsiest method,” and only a, quote, fool” would use it. And this is from their interrogation manual from Burma in 1943. Now I don’t care whether you call it torture, tough stuff, muffin stuff, not torture. The only question really is, as you say, whether it gets the bad guys, and here is where everybody gets into storytelling--you’ve heard a few. I have one too. A World War II vet came up to me after a lecture and he said, in France, we caught this German soldier and we pulled a knife to his throat and said, where are the other soldiers. And I said, did you get good info? And he said yeah, sorta. I said I’m happy for you, I really am. I really am. Because if you had bad info, you’d be dead. You would be dead. The problem is that everyone who knows that torture or not-torture doesn’t work, is dead. For those for whom it works, they are walking around saying it worked for me, it worked for them, if… This is what we call in social science a biased sample. If you take real data from the best studies, armies using torture who carefully and selectively selected suspects, eighty—8,000 to 20,000 minimum is what you need to get the best-case scenario, and the best-case scenario that they manage to generate out of these cases is 20 to 78 innocent people had to be tortured for each bad guy they got. 20 to 78 innocent people for each bad guy. Now, for every accurate piece of info then you have to torture in the thousands if you’re professional about it— this is not retail business. This is wholesale. So you tell me, does torture work? I’ll give you the opinion of the professional Gestapo. In 1942 the Czech resistance assassinated Reinhard Heydrich, Reichsprotector of Czechoslovakia, Hitler wanted results, he didn’t care how, he said these guys don’t listen to anything, and the Gestapo got the three bad guys but to do that they tortured and killed 7,545 individuals, annihilating two villages. They also got 100 resistance members on the side they weren’t looking for but that’s pretty typical results, Battle of Algiers, Vietnam, we can go through them. At this point, enter Heinz von Panwitz, a career policeman and head of the Gestapo’s anti-sabotage unit from Prague, he said don’t be stupid. Depend on public cooperation, build up rapport, put out a reward. They got over a thousand tips and in fact what broke the case, what broke the case, was when Korda, a member of the Czech resistance betrayed the entire operation. Korda wasn’t tortured, he lived well, he collected a huge reward, in fact he lived long enough to be executed for treason after the war.  The professional Gestapo repeatedly decimated the resistance through public cooperation and informers, in France, Denmark, Poland, Norway, Russia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, even in the concentration camps. The Gestapo turned to torture when they lost seasoned pros like Panwitz during the war. And then they had young men with whips running around and why learn good policing when you’ve got a whip. Huge government funded studies, our government-funded studies, have proven Panwitz was right. If you don’t have public cooperation the chances that a crime will be solved falls to 10 percent. Pathetic results. The Gestapo knew public cooperation was the best anti-terrorist method. Public cooperation works even when time is short. July 21st, London, seven guys get on buses with ticking bombs. The British police got all of these guys in 10 days, and the ticking bombs. The big break came in 24 hours when the parents of Mukhtar Said-Ibrahim turned their son over after seeing the security video. These were loyal British Muslims. Would they have turned their son over if they knew he was gonna be—nottortured? The answer is no. Good torture isn’t just a source of bad intel, it destroys the only thing that really works, public cooperation. Good rapport weakens even the strongest bond we know, good rapport…restores the bond between parent and child. Even when time is short. Using these techniques during World War II, the British managed to catch 290 German spies hiding among 42,000 refugees crossing over from Europe without torturing any of them. I don’t split hairs over what torture is and what is not torture. If what makes torture moral or not-torture moral, if it saves innocent lives then the truth has to be that torture is immoral. Because it takes far more innocent lives than it has ever saved, and that’s true for not-torture. Actually, some not-torture we use is even worse than torture. Take sleep deprivation. We use it all the time. Professional Spanish Inquisitors, professional Spanish Inquisitors, wouldn’t go near it. They knew sleep deprivation has hypnotic effects under repeated questioning, people will generate visions. Perfect for seeing packs of the devil and Al Qaeda everywhere. That’s why crazy Scottish witch-hunters used it. It was very effective. But that’s them Protestants, not—a Catholic inquisitor would not go near this, quote, not-torture. They knew it was unreliable, and yet we use it all the time as if it gets magical results, well it is, it’s magical thinking. That’s all it is. Good torture creates bad intelligence, involves torturing thousands of innocents, while the terrorists run free. It destroys our soldiers who are forced to put in these positions [sic], we have the studies, and the organizations. And limited time makes all these effects worse, not better. That’s the data. The professional Gestapo knew this. The Japanese Kempei Tai knew this. Even occasionally a Spanish Inquisitor figured this one out. With great respect, why shouldn’t we not learn from them. Good counter-terrorism policy depends on winning public support and building up human intelligence. Look. I used to be on the other side. I grew up in Iran under the Shah. The Shah’s SAVAK tortured terrorists, and the Shah said I don’t torture, we just have different ways of doing that, we have to be tough on these medieval radical throwbacks. They’re different. And Khomeini said, medieval throwback, now look who’s talking, the guys who torture. Nothing was a better recruitment tool for Islamic radicalism than not-torture. And so the question is, how many countries in the Middle East do you want to lose? How many witch-hunters do you want to follow. There is intelligence out there. It is time, it is really long past time for us to get our act together. Thank you."
